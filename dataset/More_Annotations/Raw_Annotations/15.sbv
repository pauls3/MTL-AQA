0:00:00.000,0:00:04.799
driving so this is completely random and

0:00:02.280,0:00:07.350
the divers will dive in the random order

0:00:04.799,0:00:09.870
selected by a computer and then of

0:00:07.350,0:00:11.820
course compiling the results at the end

0:00:09.870,0:00:13.860
of the contest today the reverse order

0:00:11.820,0:00:15.540
of the top 18 will go through into the

0:00:13.860,0:00:18.690
semi-final so the best diver from the

0:00:15.540,0:00:21.000
prelims will dive last tomorrow now as

0:00:18.690,0:00:24.210
opposed to the sinker you may have seen

0:00:21.000,0:00:26.070
there are no 2.0 dives here we start at

0:00:24.210,0:00:28.980
3 and we never go a little bit down

0:00:26.070,0:00:30.929
about 2.9 but it's always in the 3 rate

0:00:28.980,0:00:33.149
ratio or a little bit higher yeah that's

0:00:30.929,0:00:35.790
right the the females will perform 5

0:00:33.149,0:00:37.590
dives from 5 different groups the

0:00:35.790,0:00:40.140
different groups in diving are forwards

0:00:37.590,0:00:42.540
which is speaks for itself and backwards

0:00:40.140,0:00:44.250
which also speaks for itself the inward

0:00:42.540,0:00:46.530
group is where you stand backwards and

0:00:44.250,0:00:48.750
spin forwards towards the diving board

0:00:46.530,0:00:50.489
and the dangerous reverse group is where

0:00:48.750,0:00:52.469
you actually walk down the diving board

0:00:50.489,0:00:54.899
forwards landing on the end and then

0:00:52.469,0:00:56.910
jump away spin backwards towards the

0:00:54.899,0:00:58.949
diving board the final group that you'll

0:00:56.910,0:01:01.140
see today is the twist which is really

0:00:58.949,0:01:03.690
your rotating along the longitudinal

0:01:01.140,0:01:04.170
axis as well we will explain as you go

0:01:03.690,0:01:05.850
along

0:01:04.170,0:01:08.250
first I've were about to jump on the

0:01:05.850,0:01:09.869
diving board there and of course there

0:01:08.250,0:01:13.110
was no synchronized judges here today

0:01:09.869,0:01:14.880
it's all execution seven execution

0:01:13.110,0:01:17.670
judges the two highest and two lowest

0:01:14.880,0:01:19.979
marks are taken away to leave the three

0:01:17.670,0:01:22.409
remaining scores those are multiplied by

0:01:19.979,0:01:25.590
the degree of difficulty and that gives

0:01:22.409,0:01:28.799
you the total for the dive so we're

0:01:25.590,0:01:31.320
ready to get underway first diver is

0:01:28.799,0:01:35.189
from Australia Charlene Stratton

0:01:31.320,0:01:37.710
fifth of the world's last year 7th in

0:01:35.189,0:01:39.390
Beijing four years ago and that opening

0:01:37.710,0:01:41.850
dive will be a forward two and a half

0:01:39.390,0:01:45.060
summer sorts with one twist performed in

0:01:41.850,0:01:49.909
the pike position remember top 18 will

0:01:45.060,0:01:49.909
progress to the semi-finals tomorrow

0:01:51.720,0:02:00.240
oh very nice charlie

0:01:56.940,0:02:03.240
disappointed not to be on the podium

0:02:00.240,0:02:05.580
after the three metre synchro she's a

0:02:03.240,0:02:09.119
formidable diver in her own right and

0:02:05.580,0:02:11.970
that is a sensational start but this 25

0:02:09.119,0:02:13.470
year old Australians campaign beautiful

0:02:11.970,0:02:15.360
entry into the water of course the judge

0:02:13.470,0:02:17.760
is looking for the vertical entry

0:02:15.360,0:02:20.520
without any splash and that didn't look

0:02:17.760,0:02:23.610
too far away to me very good start there

0:02:20.520,0:02:26.040
anything over 70 points is huge great

0:02:23.610,0:02:28.590
start there for the Aussie yeah 72 will

0:02:26.040,0:02:33.270
do nice start for the 24 year old

0:02:28.590,0:02:35.490
Australian now from Germany again

0:02:33.270,0:02:39.450
forward two and a half some sorts of one

0:02:35.490,0:02:44.580
twist it's the semifinals in Beijing

0:02:39.450,0:02:46.710
catch your dick off nice solid opening

0:02:44.580,0:02:49.110
round tie from catch a very experienced

0:02:46.710,0:02:50.790
one of the older females in the contest

0:02:49.110,0:02:53.070
to date will be relying on that

0:02:50.790,0:02:55.170
experience to get her through this Paula

0:02:53.070,0:02:56.940
Murray safely and if she continues with

0:02:55.170,0:02:59.070
the next four dives and the same

0:02:56.940,0:03:00.900
standard as this opening dive then

0:02:59.070,0:03:03.930
she'll be assured of a place in the top

0:03:00.900,0:03:06.090
18 again here's the one and a half

0:03:03.930,0:03:07.650
somersaults eye into the one twist and

0:03:06.090,0:03:10.230
then folding over back into the water

0:03:07.650,0:03:11.880
it's a lot to get in in this time the

0:03:10.230,0:03:14.220
coach has seen happy nodding their

0:03:11.880,0:03:16.380
seventh across the board not quite as

0:03:14.220,0:03:19.440
good as the opening day we saw from

0:03:16.380,0:03:21.600
Charlene Stratton worth 63 points

0:03:19.440,0:03:23.790
according to the judges and she goes

0:03:21.600,0:03:26.190
into second the big roar greeting the

0:03:23.790,0:03:29.070
first of the British competitors sites

0:03:26.190,0:03:30.810
differential in the diving style for

0:03:29.070,0:03:33.209
this one in words two and a half

0:03:30.810,0:03:37.940
somersaults in the pipe position for

0:03:33.209,0:03:37.940
Hannah Starling of Great Britain

0:03:39.750,0:03:45.660
Oh unfazed the young seventeen-year-old

0:03:43.380,0:03:47.490
youngest competitor in this contest

0:03:45.660,0:03:49.710
obviously friends and family they're

0:03:47.490,0:03:52.500
waving and cheering her on talent

0:03:49.710,0:03:54.510
identification program found this little

0:03:52.500,0:03:56.790
rough diamond and here she is at 17

0:03:54.510,0:03:58.260
years old performing the inward two and

0:03:56.790,0:03:59.550
a half in the pike position is her

0:03:58.260,0:04:01.500
opening dive

0:03:59.550,0:04:03.660
she'll be pleased without men finishing

0:04:01.500,0:04:05.940
a little bit low on the water not quite

0:04:03.660,0:04:06.450
having enough room but that's a solid

0:04:05.940,0:04:08.100
start

0:04:06.450,0:04:10.380
well done Hannah yeah good see a smile

0:04:08.100,0:04:12.270
on her face she leaves as quickly over

0:04:10.380,0:04:13.800
their coach to see what went wrong she

0:04:12.270,0:04:16.500
probably does know what went wrong

0:04:13.800,0:04:19.500
didn't go too far wrong 60 on the board

0:04:16.500,0:04:22.860
for opening dive now another debutante

0:04:19.500,0:04:25.950
in the Olympic Games is Marianna furrow

0:04:22.860,0:04:35.220
CA France in wood two and a half again

0:04:25.950,0:04:38.610
we're tuck we are a little bit of a

0:04:35.220,0:04:39.990
small basic simple dive is filled the

0:04:38.610,0:04:41.940
inward two and a half so where you're

0:04:39.990,0:04:44.280
standing backwards spinning forward

0:04:41.940,0:04:45.900
towards a diving board this time opting

0:04:44.280,0:04:47.490
for the Tuck position so bending at the

0:04:45.900,0:04:49.740
hip and at the knee holding on to the

0:04:47.490,0:04:51.810
shins swinging the arms up and over the

0:04:49.740,0:04:54.060
diving board squeezing into that Tuck

0:04:51.810,0:04:55.979
shape all looks good is very neat and

0:04:54.060,0:05:01.979
very tidy it is a lower degree of

0:04:55.979,0:05:05.940
difficulty only 2.7 and that gives her

0:05:01.979,0:05:07.380
50 6.70 March by the way some people in

0:05:05.940,0:05:09.570
America thought you were Welsh the other

0:05:07.380,0:05:12.660
day and let some friends are watching in

0:05:09.570,0:05:15.330
in the US said you're working with the

0:05:12.660,0:05:18.780
Welsh one apparently there you go hey

0:05:15.330,0:05:21.960
comes Francesca della pay of Italy and

0:05:18.780,0:05:23.669
it is back up to 3.0 degree of

0:05:21.960,0:05:26.780
difficulty on this inward two and half

0:05:23.669,0:05:30.980
somersaults with Mike

0:05:26.780,0:05:32.780
or a beautiful start obviously riding

0:05:30.980,0:05:35.150
high from a performance already this

0:05:32.780,0:05:36.710
week in the three metre synchro with

0:05:35.150,0:05:38.740
their partner tanyaconnor otto who is

0:05:36.710,0:05:41.600
also in this competition

0:05:38.740,0:05:43.730
Francesca they're very strong needs to

0:05:41.600,0:05:45.920
be this is a tough dive beautiful Pike

0:05:43.730,0:05:48.110
shape I couldn't see any gap in between

0:05:45.920,0:05:49.880
the thighs and the chest there we are

0:05:48.110,0:05:52.040
look at that super slow motion taking

0:05:49.880,0:05:54.590
off the diving board their safe distance

0:05:52.040,0:05:55.630
away clean entry into the water good

0:05:54.590,0:05:59.840
start

0:05:55.630,0:06:01.280
69 for de la Paix puts her for the time

0:05:59.840,0:06:03.880
being into second place course they

0:06:01.280,0:06:08.480
first are five rounds of dives

0:06:03.880,0:06:10.280
yes Anastasia Wozniak of up and she is

0:06:08.480,0:06:13.250
going for two point seven back down the

0:06:10.280,0:06:23.000
tariff total and this is an in words two

0:06:13.250,0:06:25.640
and a half seven sorts with tuck or just

0:06:23.000,0:06:28.130
letting the time we're all over vertical

0:06:25.640,0:06:29.930
they're opting for a lower degree of

0:06:28.130,0:06:31.340
difficulty this is two point seven all

0:06:29.930,0:06:33.320
the girls of course will perform an

0:06:31.340,0:06:35.240
inward today which is that we stand

0:06:33.320,0:06:37.550
backwards spin forwards towards a diving

0:06:35.240,0:06:39.140
board just coming out of her dive a

0:06:37.550,0:06:41.300
little bit late there and as you see on

0:06:39.140,0:06:43.220
the replay over a vertical that's only

0:06:41.300,0:06:45.020
going to get sevens and Alice Tate is

0:06:43.220,0:06:47.000
normally up with the aches and eights

0:06:45.020,0:06:50.540
and nines so some work to do

0:06:47.000,0:06:52.460
yeah doctored and the alarms really this

0:06:50.540,0:06:55.400
early four to nine point four zero is

0:06:52.460,0:06:57.370
not a catastrophe by any means but not

0:06:55.400,0:07:01.600
the greatest of starts from Wozniak Eva

0:06:57.370,0:07:04.640
now there's Nora submission scape of

0:07:01.600,0:07:07.070
Germany again we're sticking down the

0:07:04.640,0:07:10.990
lower end of the tariff range with a in

0:07:07.070,0:07:10.990
we're two and a half we tuck

0:07:13.479,0:07:17.319
oh if she was a little nearer to the

0:07:15.879,0:07:19.960
diving board still a safe distance

0:07:17.319,0:07:22.629
interestingly enough all the girls

0:07:19.960,0:07:23.680
performing an inward it seems to be one

0:07:22.629,0:07:26.259
that most people are comfortable

0:07:23.680,0:07:27.520
starting with a bit of a double Banks

0:07:26.259,0:07:29.589
they're taking your feet off the diving

0:07:27.520,0:07:31.569
board before she's actually taken off I

0:07:29.589,0:07:33.339
don't know the judges probably won't

0:07:31.569,0:07:35.050
penalize for being too near I wouldn't

0:07:33.339,0:07:37.300
want to see it any closer to the diving

0:07:35.050,0:07:39.099
board than that the Tuck position is

0:07:37.300,0:07:41.740
actually easier than the pike position

0:07:39.099,0:07:44.409
you've got less you know less to get

0:07:41.740,0:07:45.879
around it's easier to make the dive and

0:07:44.409,0:07:48.029
complete the dive so that's why some

0:07:45.879,0:07:51.069
girls choosing the tucked over the pike

0:07:48.029,0:07:53.710
59.4 zero are the totals will remind you

0:07:51.069,0:07:55.599
and recap on how those marks are arrived

0:07:53.710,0:07:59.249
at later now he comes the bronze

0:07:55.599,0:08:04.089
medalist from Shanghai last year able

0:07:59.249,0:08:06.520
more beautiful already a medal in the

0:08:04.089,0:08:08.319
bag says oh and I'll cheer the coaches

0:08:06.520,0:08:09.580
they like it needs to be solid this is

0:08:08.319,0:08:13.689
the first one we've seen today a

0:08:09.580,0:08:16.059
backward two and a half somersaults miss

0:08:13.689,0:08:18.219
Jennifer just under super slow-mo here

0:08:16.059,0:08:20.020
we go swinging the arms good distance

0:08:18.219,0:08:22.029
from the diving board beautiful Pike

0:08:20.020,0:08:23.800
shape knows exactly where she is

0:08:22.029,0:08:26.289
watching where she's been rather than

0:08:23.800,0:08:28.659
where she's going and lands on her head

0:08:26.289,0:08:30.789
eights across the board good work very

0:08:28.659,0:08:33.099
good work indeed puts her joint first

0:08:30.789,0:08:34.930
two with Shayan stratton after the first

0:08:33.099,0:08:37.750
round so far now Anna Lindberg

0:08:34.930,0:08:39.430
surprisingly had a very poor words last

0:08:37.750,0:08:40.599
year doesn't make it beyond the pre

0:08:39.430,0:08:42.909
level she we wanted to put things right

0:08:40.599,0:08:45.040
here here's a back two and a half

0:08:42.909,0:08:48.449
somersaults in the pike position 3.0

0:08:45.040,0:08:48.449
degree of difficulty

0:08:49.050,0:08:55.000
again a veteran of many many Olympic

0:08:51.640,0:08:57.700
Games an exceptional diver always on the

0:08:55.000,0:08:59.980
springboard otherwise Olympic medalist

0:08:57.700,0:09:01.930
fathers one of the the judges here not

0:08:59.980,0:09:04.330
judging this competition but Matt's

0:09:01.930,0:09:06.040
Limburg is one of the judges one of the

0:09:04.330,0:09:07.900
FINA judges back two and a half in the

0:09:06.040,0:09:10.600
pike position straight up and down

0:09:07.900,0:09:12.790
consistent as you would imagine from

0:09:10.600,0:09:16.660
Anna and what she was hoping for to open

0:09:12.790,0:09:18.430
her campaign good could you see the

0:09:16.660,0:09:21.340
super slo-mo cam there showing the

0:09:18.430,0:09:23.230
strain on these divers faces because

0:09:21.340,0:09:25.240
they have to five more times or four

0:09:23.230,0:09:26.740
more times today and then their cost ten

0:09:25.240,0:09:30.310
more times if they get through to the

0:09:26.740,0:09:33.310
final that's the mark there for her now

0:09:30.310,0:09:35.710
Christina Lucas of America at her

0:09:33.310,0:09:38.220
opening round dive is a back two and a

0:09:35.710,0:09:42.400
half summer sorts with pike in with the

0:09:38.220,0:09:48.970
3.0 degree of difficulty or such a

0:09:42.400,0:09:50.680
powerful diver excellent elevation from

0:09:48.970,0:09:52.300
the diving boards all about timing

0:09:50.680,0:09:53.920
look at this depression here on the

0:09:52.300,0:09:55.990
diving board waiting for it to flicker

0:09:53.920,0:09:58.120
back up look at the elevation toes above

0:09:55.990,0:10:00.970
the five meter board has to come out of

0:09:58.120,0:10:02.890
the dive very early cruising this is

0:10:00.970,0:10:05.140
what we see the Chinese divers doing

0:10:02.890,0:10:08.680
Christina here making that dive very

0:10:05.140,0:10:10.630
very easily and controlling it look at

0:10:08.680,0:10:13.240
that h2 across the board seventy two

0:10:10.630,0:10:15.790
third seventy-two of the competition so

0:10:13.240,0:10:19.810
we have joined first place in the first

0:10:15.790,0:10:22.540
round now on to the Mexican yes is Laura

0:10:19.810,0:10:26.020
Sanchez sort of with an inward two and a

0:10:22.540,0:10:29.740
half somersault with Mike 3.0 degree of

0:10:26.020,0:10:32.290
difficulty all just letting the entry

0:10:29.740,0:10:33.760
there roll over vertical remember the

0:10:32.290,0:10:36.730
judges are looking for the vertical

0:10:33.760,0:10:39.100
entry without any splash the dive itself

0:10:36.730,0:10:40.630
was the aerial work was excellent here

0:10:39.100,0:10:43.360
we are right over the timing board

0:10:40.630,0:10:44.589
moving away a safe distance making the

0:10:43.360,0:10:46.390
time a little easier than she was

0:10:44.589,0:10:48.240
expecting to rolling over a vertical

0:10:46.390,0:10:50.920
throwing up a little bit of splash

0:10:48.240,0:10:52.710
that's gonna cost her a little bit from

0:10:50.920,0:10:55.660
the mark on the marks from the judges

0:10:52.710,0:11:00.200
yeah 10th place for the time being for

0:10:55.660,0:11:02.580
Laura Sanchez Soto 57 the total mark

0:11:00.200,0:11:07.730
now he can was Wendy yeah that's a

0:11:02.580,0:11:09.900
nickname dang it Yan Yi of Malaysia and

0:11:07.730,0:11:11.400
she's gonna open up with an inward

0:11:09.900,0:11:13.650
two-and-a-half summer sorts with Pike

0:11:11.400,0:11:20.550
again she can see on your screen three

0:11:13.650,0:11:22.800
point zero degree of difficulty oh wow

0:11:20.550,0:11:24.930
little pocket rocket that dive can

0:11:22.800,0:11:29.250
sometimes be quite incredibly

0:11:24.930,0:11:31.460
challenging and she's making easy work

0:11:29.250,0:11:34.140
of that look at this up up and away

0:11:31.460,0:11:36.000
quite short which makes it easier in the

0:11:34.140,0:11:37.140
pike shape just a twisting as she went

0:11:36.000,0:11:39.630
in the water there the judges won't

0:11:37.140,0:11:40.860
won't get the benefit of the replay but

0:11:39.630,0:11:42.270
maybe one or two would have picked them

0:11:40.860,0:11:44.130
up be interesting to see what the marks

0:11:42.270,0:11:45.900
are on this yeah one of them did judge

0:11:44.130,0:11:48.090
number two certainly saw the twist in

0:11:45.900,0:11:49.620
the water yeah she was a long way to the

0:11:48.090,0:11:55.590
side of the board when she landed there

0:11:49.620,0:11:58.440
wasn't she's 60.00 for egg in joint

0:11:55.590,0:12:02.460
seventh placed a very experienced

0:11:58.440,0:12:05.610
competitor is Tanya Kenyatta from Italy

0:12:02.460,0:12:09.360
in this position many times back two and

0:12:05.610,0:12:13.190
a half somersaults with Mike Ling gambit

0:12:09.360,0:12:15.240
for this experienced Italian Oh

0:12:13.190,0:12:17.100
beautiful dive that's the dive of the

0:12:15.240,0:12:18.930
contest so far we are in its early

0:12:17.100,0:12:21.240
stages Wow

0:12:18.930,0:12:24.720
Tanya missing out on a medal a few days

0:12:21.240,0:12:26.010
ago we'll be looking to to feature in

0:12:24.720,0:12:28.020
the podium but she's got a few days to

0:12:26.010,0:12:30.150
wait yet but my goodness if she

0:12:28.020,0:12:31.650
continues to dive with the kind of form

0:12:30.150,0:12:33.810
she's been showing in trainee she'll

0:12:31.650,0:12:36.270
certainly be a challenger one to watch

0:12:33.810,0:12:39.300
over the next three days Leon Taylor and

0:12:36.270,0:12:41.250
judges in accord 75 is the best mark

0:12:39.300,0:12:43.520
we've seen so far which puts her in

0:12:41.250,0:12:47.490
first place above Abel Lucas and

0:12:43.520,0:12:50.640
Stratton on to another Malaysian which I

0:12:47.490,0:12:52.530
saw one hiccups another Chong with an

0:12:50.640,0:12:55.740
inward two and a half soy sauce with

0:12:52.530,0:12:58.050
taka says she's going back to the 2.7 s

0:12:55.740,0:13:02.400
nice comfortable start or so you would

0:12:58.050,0:13:04.830
think anyway for her in round one all

0:13:02.400,0:13:09.860
playing it a little bit safe needed to

0:13:04.830,0:13:09.860
be better than that only 22 years old

0:13:09.920,0:13:15.180
leaving yourself a little bit more to do

0:13:13.470,0:13:17.160
on the next four dives the takeoff is

0:13:15.180,0:13:20.610
good notations all good chin in towards

0:13:17.160,0:13:23.250
a chest over a vertical six six and a

0:13:20.610,0:13:25.200
half probably and two point seven needs

0:13:23.250,0:13:27.000
to be a little bit better than that

0:13:25.200,0:13:28.140
two point seven and two point eight and

0:13:27.000,0:13:29.520
there's quite a few those sprinkled in

0:13:28.140,0:13:31.410
here surely puts you behind the eight

0:13:29.520,0:13:32.520
ball in tempting qualification why would

0:13:31.410,0:13:33.180
you do that well you don't want to go

0:13:32.520,0:13:34.920
for broke

0:13:33.180,0:13:36.540
well if you make a mess of a three point

0:13:34.920,0:13:38.070
zero then you're not gonna be anywhere

0:13:36.540,0:13:41.370
near the pace it's a very risky business

0:13:38.070,0:13:45.149
anyway of diving so it's not risk averse

0:13:41.370,0:13:47.279
is it here we go with Cassidy Krug and

0:13:45.149,0:13:49.230
we're two and a half three point zero

0:13:47.279,0:13:57.660
I've seen this before in the plank

0:13:49.230,0:13:59.839
position more beautiful Wow okay you can

0:13:57.660,0:14:02.610
crack a smile if you aren't mr. coach

0:13:59.839,0:14:07.050
but wow I was very very impressed been

0:14:02.610,0:14:08.520
watching this girl in training looking

0:14:07.050,0:14:10.020
for height up on the diving board and

0:14:08.520,0:14:12.990
she has got that in abundance that's

0:14:10.020,0:14:17.180
going to get eights for sure and yeah

0:14:12.990,0:14:17.180
ideal start there for Cassidy

0:14:17.990,0:14:21.779
so what judges think of that yeah

0:14:20.790,0:14:23.370
they're quite happy with it

0:14:21.779,0:14:26.550
she should be two seventy three point

0:14:23.370,0:14:30.980
five zero put into second behind

0:14:26.550,0:14:37.320
Kenyatta at the stage of round one

0:14:30.980,0:14:42.390
there's that buzina of Russia yeah same

0:14:37.320,0:14:44.399
with two and a half again a little bit

0:14:42.390,0:14:46.290
of a twist on the entry into the water

0:14:44.399,0:14:49.320
the dive other than that was almost

0:14:46.290,0:14:52.620
faultless so it's a beautiful diver long

0:14:49.320,0:14:53.730
lines great lines into the water I don't

0:14:52.620,0:14:56.279
know whether we can see on the replay

0:14:53.730,0:14:58.529
here you could just see both of her calf

0:14:56.279,0:15:00.029
so she goes in beautiful toe point look

0:14:58.529,0:15:01.050
at that this is what diving should look

0:15:00.029,0:15:03.000
like you could just see they're both

0:15:01.050,0:15:07.890
over the feet as she went in which means

0:15:03.000,0:15:10.020
she's twisted and that doesn't well

0:15:07.890,0:15:13.040
let's see come on judges oh they missed

0:15:10.020,0:15:16.200
it okay no need to be personal at

0:15:13.040,0:15:17.880
aventure Chavez muñoz ready to go

0:15:16.200,0:15:23.250
already with a forward two and a half

0:15:17.880,0:15:25.350
oh she was hanging ten which means all

0:15:23.250,0:15:27.030
ten toes off the end of the diving board

0:15:25.350,0:15:29.070
this is you know this is why lots of the

0:15:27.030,0:15:31.020
girls deciding not to start with a

0:15:29.070,0:15:33.480
hurdle step here we go let's look at

0:15:31.020,0:15:36.060
this on the replay uh-oh

0:15:33.480,0:15:39.060
all ten toes over the end tipping

0:15:36.060,0:15:41.370
forward with the pallets just so well to

0:15:39.060,0:15:43.230
manage to complete the tie without

0:15:41.370,0:15:44.760
landing completely on her face well what

0:15:43.230,0:15:47.880
an unfortunate start just shows how

0:15:44.760,0:15:51.390
difficult these dives are 22.5 ouch yeah

0:15:47.880,0:15:54.840
and that could also end her chances of

0:15:51.390,0:15:57.090
making the 18 that are required to go

0:15:54.840,0:16:02.190
through to the next stage already her

0:15:57.090,0:16:04.380
competition could be over now thing like

0:16:02.190,0:16:06.120
that at all this is probably how it

0:16:04.380,0:16:11.220
should be executed in we're two and a

0:16:06.120,0:16:12.600
half to far away from the diving board

0:16:11.220,0:16:14.670
there with Atos this is why this

0:16:12.600,0:16:16.830
particular dive can be a bit of a

0:16:14.670,0:16:18.720
challenge let's have a look at the

0:16:16.830,0:16:20.730
replay to see how close she actually was

0:16:18.720,0:16:22.260
I still think it's a safe distance here

0:16:20.730,0:16:24.960
we are in word spinning forwards towards

0:16:22.260,0:16:26.730
a diving board their toes aren't that

0:16:24.960,0:16:29.070
far away are they probably just tipping

0:16:26.730,0:16:31.710
over a vertical as well I'm sure she'll

0:16:29.070,0:16:33.090
be performing better as we go on there

0:16:31.710,0:16:35.040
may be a little shaky start there from

0:16:33.090,0:16:37.500
the already Olympic champion so far this

0:16:35.040,0:16:40.170
these games tipping over a vertical as

0:16:37.500,0:16:44.220
you can see I just spotted that look at

0:16:40.170,0:16:48.690
these marks eight will count towards

0:16:44.220,0:16:50.190
that total of 72 change sometimes I

0:16:48.690,0:16:51.990
marked up on this kind of diamond with

0:16:50.190,0:16:54.750
two and a half some sorts for the

0:16:51.990,0:16:57.750
opening dive for Elena Feder over over

0:16:54.750,0:16:59.790
Ukraine all struggling a little bit

0:16:57.750,0:17:01.410
there Elena this is a difference bob was

0:16:59.790,0:17:03.150
asking me about their difference between

0:17:01.410,0:17:06.120
tuck and hiked if you're gonna do the

0:17:03.150,0:17:07.890
pike one 43.0 you need to be able to

0:17:06.120,0:17:09.600
make it and you can see here Elena is

0:17:07.890,0:17:12.089
struggling a little bit she's running

0:17:09.600,0:17:14.520
out of room toes aren't too far away for

0:17:12.089,0:17:16.110
the diving board chin tucked in towards

0:17:14.520,0:17:17.189
the chest because she wasn't quite I

0:17:16.110,0:17:19.410
didn't have enough room that's only

0:17:17.189,0:17:20.939
gonna get four and a half five yeah

0:17:19.410,0:17:24.360
that's not good should have done it

0:17:20.939,0:17:26.550
tucked maybe now she knows she'd know at

0:17:24.360,0:17:28.500
the time when she put a list of dives in

0:17:26.550,0:17:31.230
they fed her over

0:17:28.500,0:17:32.789
near the bottom than the top after that

0:17:31.230,0:17:35.820
first round I've just laying Castillo

0:17:32.789,0:17:40.350
Suarez for Venezuela for two and a half

0:17:35.820,0:17:46.799
with one twist in a 3.0 degree of

0:17:40.350,0:17:49.110
difficulty to start off her program all

0:17:46.799,0:17:50.909
very nice entry into the water the RIP

0:17:49.110,0:17:52.770
entry the reason it's called the RIP

0:17:50.909,0:17:55.080
entry is when you're close to it it

0:17:52.770,0:17:57.659
sounds like you're chairing the water

0:17:55.080,0:17:59.250
apart and splashes entry is exactly what

0:17:57.659,0:18:00.630
the judges are looking for a little bit

0:17:59.250,0:18:02.880
back from the end of the diving board

0:18:00.630,0:18:04.650
here isn't quite as much spring there

0:18:02.880,0:18:06.980
and when you toes on the end but you

0:18:04.650,0:18:09.120
don't want to be right over the end a

0:18:06.980,0:18:09.720
little bit to the corner there's the

0:18:09.120,0:18:11.010
twist

0:18:09.720,0:18:12.150
after the one half somersaults

0:18:11.010,0:18:14.280
completing the two and a half

0:18:12.150,0:18:16.470
somersaults she was a little bit here

0:18:14.280,0:18:19.860
and there in the air and so the churches

0:18:16.470,0:18:24.330
have gone yeah mixed bag here and there

0:18:19.860,0:18:29.130
and everywhere 60.00 yes her total mark

0:18:24.330,0:18:32.730
Wow you know that Chinese is moving ship

0:18:29.130,0:18:35.820
and she's gonna open up with that same

0:18:32.730,0:18:38.490
dive favored by the majority of the

0:18:35.820,0:18:41.210
thirty divers here either in Pike or

0:18:38.490,0:18:48.650
tuck position in which two and a half

0:18:41.210,0:18:51.630
where 3.0 or no mistakes from Wu already

0:18:48.650,0:18:53.880
triple Olympic champion in the three

0:18:51.630,0:18:55.679
metre synchro event she's got a silver

0:18:53.880,0:18:58.260
and a bronze to boot in the individuals

0:18:55.679,0:19:00.900
looking for medal number six over these

0:18:58.260,0:19:03.330
well in the final in a few days time and

0:19:00.900,0:19:05.820
if she dies anything like that then I

0:19:03.330,0:19:08.010
can say for certain she will be a record

0:19:05.820,0:19:12.289
breaker or a record equal er actually in

0:19:08.010,0:19:15.750
women's diving beautiful dive from Wu

0:19:12.289,0:19:18.900
will indeed seventy eight point zero

0:19:15.750,0:19:21.720
zero mines of 8.5 s count towards at

0:19:18.900,0:19:25.230
total of 78 which puts her in the lead

0:19:21.720,0:19:28.140
now second Olympic Games for Rebecca

0:19:25.230,0:19:30.690
gallantry and they comes that dive again

0:19:28.140,0:19:33.640
see how the other Britain's second of

0:19:30.690,0:19:36.340
them does with this

0:19:33.640,0:19:38.080
oh it's pretty tidy in the air the entry

0:19:36.340,0:19:41.170
into the water looked a little bit

0:19:38.080,0:19:43.840
apprehensive if I'm honest she needed to

0:19:41.170,0:19:45.460
be a little bit more or confident that

0:19:43.840,0:19:47.350
she went into the water or the hardware

0:19:45.460,0:19:49.240
works great up here's the one and a half

0:19:47.350,0:19:51.549
somersaults there's the one twist

0:19:49.240,0:19:52.929
everything looks good but just rolls

0:19:51.549,0:19:54.940
into the water there without

0:19:52.929,0:19:57.580
straightening out perfectly for that

0:19:54.940,0:19:59.350
vertical entry cameraman struggling to

0:19:57.580,0:20:01.420
keep up there with all the twists and

0:19:59.350,0:20:03.850
turns rolling into the water so the

0:20:01.420,0:20:04.210
judges will penalize for that still

0:20:03.850,0:20:07.299
steady

0:20:04.210,0:20:09.370
yeah it's steady enough 63 is okay no

0:20:07.299,0:20:12.669
alarms really for Rebecca gantry with

0:20:09.370,0:20:14.559
her opening dive and his men Scout of

0:20:12.669,0:20:19.090
Ukraine backward two and a half soy

0:20:14.559,0:20:21.220
sauce all just taping over from vertical

0:20:19.090,0:20:23.530
as she went in maybe losing her balance

0:20:21.220,0:20:25.510
a little bit as she takes off from the

0:20:23.530,0:20:27.400
springboard do you lean too far back the

0:20:25.510,0:20:29.830
springboard or flip your feet up a

0:20:27.400,0:20:31.750
little bit too quickly so as you can see

0:20:29.830,0:20:33.370
here letting go of her legs probably a

0:20:31.750,0:20:37.090
little bit late and there she goes over

0:20:33.370,0:20:39.100
she goes in fact timber okay not very

0:20:37.090,0:20:41.080
straight in terms of where the dive was

0:20:39.100,0:20:42.610
going she was nearly into the front row

0:20:41.080,0:20:45.179
of the audience there for forty nine

0:20:42.610,0:20:47.740
point five zero for miss Metzger and

0:20:45.179,0:20:52.330
this would work to be done if she wants

0:20:47.740,0:21:00.130
to make the top 18 for tomorrow Fanny

0:20:52.330,0:21:03.270
Bouvet of France just a 2.4 degree of

0:21:00.130,0:21:06.630
difficulty from funny she is one of the

0:21:03.270,0:21:08.650
youngest competitors at 18 years old

0:21:06.630,0:21:10.299
forward two and a half in the pike

0:21:08.650,0:21:12.700
position normally the girls are doing

0:21:10.299,0:21:14.530
three and a half's so this is only two

0:21:12.700,0:21:16.360
point four it needs to be very very good

0:21:14.530,0:21:19.179
I think that's only going to get six

0:21:16.360,0:21:21.460
sister sevens which means she'll be off

0:21:19.179,0:21:23.260
the place I would not expect her to to

0:21:21.460,0:21:25.480
make it through with this low degree of

0:21:23.260,0:21:31.330
difficulty but what an experience 18

0:21:25.480,0:21:33.549
years old first dive for Fanny and

0:21:31.330,0:21:36.760
that's the marks that she has accrued

0:21:33.549,0:21:41.530
now that was rather crude to Jennifer

0:21:36.760,0:21:44.500
Benitez for Spain the only Spanish diver

0:21:41.530,0:21:46.270
here on a team of one there were two and

0:21:44.500,0:21:53.950
a half somersaults

0:21:46.270,0:21:55.570
Oh a little bit shaky I'm sure there's

0:21:53.950,0:21:58.510
plenty of nerves jangling out there

0:21:55.570,0:22:00.610
today team of one a thick heavy Xavier

0:21:58.510,0:22:02.770
Ilan Oh being the men's as well but

0:22:00.610,0:22:04.990
certainly the only female Spanish diver

0:22:02.770,0:22:06.460
here in word two and a half seems to be

0:22:04.990,0:22:09.610
moving ahead of mind a little bit there

0:22:06.460,0:22:13.030
causing her to tip over a vertical yeah

0:22:09.610,0:22:15.160
that's a shaky start she's been looking

0:22:13.030,0:22:15.970
for something a little more solid to

0:22:15.160,0:22:18.730
keep her in the game

0:22:15.970,0:22:21.010
well the marks account there are the six

0:22:18.730,0:22:23.370
is to 4.5 disappears from the screen and

0:22:21.010,0:22:28.300
doesn't get included in her marks

0:22:23.370,0:22:29.830
Juliana Veloso our Brazil the much tried

0:22:28.300,0:22:35.770
and tested forward two and a half with

0:22:29.830,0:22:38.110
one twist a little bit the entry into

0:22:35.770,0:22:42.040
the water is what this a bit the let it

0:22:38.110,0:22:44.920
down I think she needs to be a little

0:22:42.040,0:22:47.620
bit higher on this die so I'm swing or

0:22:44.920,0:22:49.600
looks okay here maybe she does the twist

0:22:47.620,0:22:51.070
first and then squeezes in not quite

0:22:49.600,0:22:52.900
enough room on the end there

0:22:51.070,0:22:55.780
so she'll only be getting five and a

0:22:52.900,0:22:57.429
half six is thirty one years old oldest

0:22:55.780,0:23:00.130
competitor in this contest plenty of

0:22:57.429,0:23:02.470
experience so maybe she'll bounce back

0:23:00.130,0:23:04.300
well she knows how to but she's gonna

0:23:02.470,0:23:06.580
have to with that forty nine point five

0:23:04.300,0:23:09.280
she's already about ten fifteen points

0:23:06.580,0:23:14.080
has drifted where she needs to be JL

0:23:09.280,0:23:15.490
Patrick of Australia and her

0:23:14.080,0:23:16.809
self-composed taking a bit more time

0:23:15.490,0:23:19.030
than some of the others divers have done

0:23:16.809,0:23:22.080
so far backward two and a half summer

0:23:19.030,0:23:22.080
sorts of with pike

0:23:25.220,0:23:31.190
yes that's really really good

0:23:28.110,0:23:34.650
both Australians they're coming out

0:23:31.190,0:23:36.270
looking to stunt their authority and the

0:23:34.650,0:23:38.370
business end of the field and that's

0:23:36.270,0:23:39.870
where you need to be remember the divers

0:23:38.370,0:23:44.670
will dive in reverse order as they go

0:23:39.870,0:23:46.710
through into the semi-finals jl marking

0:23:44.670,0:23:49.230
her campaign opening her campaign I

0:23:46.710,0:23:52.200
should say with a very very solid 3.0

0:23:49.230,0:23:55.170
back two and a half pint solid is the

0:23:52.200,0:24:00.360
word 67 point five zero takes her into

0:23:55.170,0:24:03.260
ninth place nor Obata

0:24:00.360,0:24:07.350
I repeat that for you nor a barter of

0:24:03.260,0:24:09.690
Hungary with first round dive and again

0:24:07.350,0:24:11.940
she's gone down to the 2.7 s so it has

0:24:09.690,0:24:14.640
to be pretty good you know in the mix

0:24:11.940,0:24:17.250
I'm taking your time composing yourself

0:24:14.640,0:24:28.410
on an inward two and a half somersaults

0:24:17.250,0:24:30.780
we're talking deciding to play very very

0:24:28.410,0:24:33.240
safe this morning and just noticed her

0:24:30.780,0:24:35.970
second mount dive is actually a very

0:24:33.240,0:24:38.280
very low degree of difficulty I guess is

0:24:35.970,0:24:39.690
you're playing game of tactics so opting

0:24:38.280,0:24:41.310
for the Tuck position here bending at

0:24:39.690,0:24:43.050
the knee in at the hip holding on to

0:24:41.310,0:24:47.700
those shins it's good seven and a half's

0:24:43.050,0:24:50.130
I think two point seven maybe the Pikes

0:24:47.700,0:24:53.970
a little bit too challenging for at 3.0

0:24:50.130,0:24:56.130
so game of tactics so with the tariff

0:24:53.970,0:24:57.810
being so low 56.7

0:24:56.130,0:24:59.700
well not maybe the most you could have

0:24:57.810,0:25:03.810
hoped for but probably what she was

0:24:59.700,0:25:05.430
expecting there's very few divers in

0:25:03.810,0:25:07.800
this event who have more experience than

0:25:05.430,0:25:09.840
Emily Haman's and she's up next for

0:25:07.800,0:25:11.870
Canada born in Belgium that's one thing

0:25:09.840,0:25:14.550
I didn't know about it till today and

0:25:11.870,0:25:16.950
she will go with an inward two and a

0:25:14.550,0:25:19.680
half some sorts of attack again opting

0:25:16.950,0:25:22.920
for the safe option straight off yeah

0:25:19.680,0:25:24.660
safety first and emily has extremely

0:25:22.920,0:25:26.210
long legs and so that makes anything in

0:25:24.660,0:25:28.650
the pike position very very challenging

0:25:26.210,0:25:30.000
so because your toes come quite close to

0:25:28.650,0:25:32.220
the end of the diving board when you do

0:25:30.000,0:25:34.560
this dive in the pike emily deciding to

0:25:32.220,0:25:36.870
keep in the Tuck position is a beautiful

0:25:34.560,0:25:38.370
dive it'll get eights and it's only 2.7

0:25:36.870,0:25:41.130
but that will keep her you

0:25:38.370,0:25:44.010
well over 65 points and that's where she

0:25:41.130,0:25:46.140
needs to be pretty much in the middle of

0:25:44.010,0:25:47.580
the pack yeah things that could still be

0:25:46.140,0:25:48.840
improved bond with her die of course

0:25:47.580,0:25:52.380
they all could be nice you get perfect

0:25:48.840,0:25:54.510
tens sixty seven point five zero as we

0:25:52.380,0:25:58.680
get to our last competitor and that's

0:25:54.510,0:26:03.630
flora GaN dose of Hungary two point four

0:25:58.680,0:26:07.200
forward two and a half with pike oh it's

0:26:03.630,0:26:09.540
very very precise very neat and tidy but

0:26:07.200,0:26:10.020
it's only two point four so only twenty

0:26:09.540,0:26:13.710
years old

0:26:10.020,0:26:15.450
this young lady first Olympic Games not

0:26:13.710,0:26:17.070
much of her to push the springboard onus

0:26:15.450,0:26:21.090
and you normally see that kind of frame

0:26:17.070,0:26:21.780
on the platform a beautiful smooth entry

0:26:21.090,0:26:25.620
into the water

0:26:21.780,0:26:27.690
seven seven point five yep yeah because

0:26:25.620,0:26:29.580
because it's so low in degree of

0:26:27.690,0:26:32.760
difficulty fifty two point eight is all

0:26:29.580,0:26:35.010
she can muster and that completes the

0:26:32.760,0:26:38.760
first round of the women's 3-meter

0:26:35.010,0:26:43.260
springboard can see preliminary to give

0:26:38.760,0:26:44.370
us 218 for tomorrow's semi file well

0:26:43.260,0:26:46.770
they're surprised at the top of the

0:26:44.370,0:26:50.880
table some very experienced competitors

0:26:46.770,0:26:54.390
whoo Kenyatta and Abel in one two and

0:26:50.880,0:26:56.130
joint fourth and Alipay in eighth Emily

0:26:54.390,0:26:57.210
Haman's in night so experience does

0:26:56.130,0:26:59.430
count for something in this kind of

0:26:57.210,0:27:04.730
competition so there or the moment quite

0:26:59.430,0:27:06.900
safe as they are on that page and

0:27:04.730,0:27:09.120
Starling is in there as is Rebecca

0:27:06.900,0:27:11.250
gallantry so both of the Brits are in

0:27:09.120,0:27:14.010
the top 18 at the moment Laura Sanchez

0:27:11.250,0:27:18.150
Soto if we stop now would not be and

0:27:14.010,0:27:25.050
applies to all the rest on that page and

0:27:18.150,0:27:28.440
I'm sure Chavez munos a really good

0:27:25.050,0:27:32.660
opening effort finds herself pretty much

0:27:28.440,0:27:32.660
a drift of the rest of the field

0:27:33.909,0:27:40.190
on to round two of the women 3-meter

0:27:37.789,0:27:41.839
springboard preliminaries and we're

0:27:40.190,0:27:46.339
watching in the australian charlene

0:27:41.839,0:27:49.489
Stratton 7th in beijing good opening

0:27:46.339,0:27:51.129
diver 72 can she back it up with a back

0:27:49.489,0:27:54.559
to and our summer sorts with pike

0:27:51.129,0:28:06.460
getting going for the 3.0 degree of

0:27:54.559,0:28:09.849
difficulty option yep she can back it up

0:28:06.460,0:28:12.440
okay I've mentioned previously the girls

0:28:09.849,0:28:14.839
you know don't need to be lighting this

0:28:12.440,0:28:16.789
place on fire they can save that for the

0:28:14.839,0:28:18.729
final which is not tomorrow but the day

0:28:16.789,0:28:21.979
after you're looking for a consistent

0:28:18.729,0:28:24.529
steady performance landing on your head

0:28:21.979,0:28:26.029
as we say in the diving world and that's

0:28:24.529,0:28:30.710
exactly what Charlene's doing they're

0:28:26.029,0:28:34.849
landing on her head 7 7.5 67 good enough

0:28:30.710,0:28:37.999
72 backed up with a 70 60 7.50 for

0:28:34.849,0:28:42.830
Charlene Stratton catch your dick off

0:28:37.999,0:28:45.200
with a second round dive low degree of

0:28:42.830,0:28:46.639
difficulty as well Ford three and a half

0:28:45.200,0:28:47.809
some sorts you might think with them

0:28:46.639,0:28:49.940
that rather complicated explanation

0:28:47.809,0:28:54.769
there'd be more than 2.8 but here she

0:28:49.940,0:28:56.839
comes in the tuck position yet lots

0:28:54.769,0:28:58.519
going on and lots can go wrong you've

0:28:56.839,0:29:00.440
already seen some of the divers opting

0:28:58.519,0:29:03.289
for only a forward two and a half this

0:29:00.440,0:29:05.659
of course an extra rotation extra

0:29:03.289,0:29:09.469
difficulty here we go let's count them

0:29:05.659,0:29:11.059
one two three and a half looking at the

0:29:09.469,0:29:12.859
water doesn't quite get her hands

0:29:11.059,0:29:14.389
together as she goes in you can see

0:29:12.859,0:29:15.979
they're landing in a handstand did diver

0:29:14.389,0:29:18.219
you need to be grabbing hold of a hand

0:29:15.979,0:29:21.320
to punch with a flat hand into the water

0:29:18.219,0:29:22.999
but it's steady enough to point eight

0:29:21.320,0:29:25.279
though Leon seems quite complicated for

0:29:22.999,0:29:27.109
a 2.8 to me yeah yeah it is it's just a

0:29:25.279,0:29:28.489
high degree of difficulty than the two

0:29:27.109,0:29:30.080
and a half which is only two point four

0:29:28.489,0:29:31.759
but some of the girls opting from

0:29:30.080,0:29:33.200
forward three-and-a-half piked which is

0:29:31.759,0:29:35.679
difficult and look what were watching

0:29:33.200,0:29:38.929
now hammer Starling three point one

0:29:35.679,0:29:41.719
first so we've seen of the above three

0:29:38.929,0:29:44.450
dives today and she's going for a for

0:29:41.719,0:29:45.410
three and a half with Pike first a

0:29:44.450,0:29:51.290
really tricky one

0:29:45.410,0:29:54.230
we've seen fanless darling oh yes

0:29:51.290,0:29:56.240
beautifully done tipping over vertical

0:29:54.230,0:29:58.460
marginally if she goes into the water

0:29:56.240,0:30:00.500
but this seventeen-year-old youngest

0:29:58.460,0:30:02.090
competitor betting big here today in

0:30:00.500,0:30:03.740
front of the home crowd and they

0:30:02.090,0:30:05.030
certainly like it here we go forward

0:30:03.740,0:30:08.360
three and a half in the pike position

0:30:05.030,0:30:10.820
hangs on just a little tip over I think

0:30:08.360,0:30:11.240
she'll get six and a half for that look

0:30:10.820,0:30:13.250
at this

0:30:11.240,0:30:17.600
working the diving board there is all

0:30:13.250,0:30:20.450
about rhythm good effort

0:30:17.600,0:30:21.950
second round dive and that's what I

0:30:20.450,0:30:23.450
can't like to see certainly with

0:30:21.950,0:30:25.490
youngsters suppose it's the impetuosity

0:30:23.450,0:30:27.200
of youth isn't it they're gonna go for

0:30:25.490,0:30:30.190
bigger scores if they can and Hannah has

0:30:27.200,0:30:32.930
done that with the sixty point four five

0:30:30.190,0:30:35.870
marion Lussier is working her way up the

0:30:32.930,0:30:39.320
standings with 2.8 on this forward three

0:30:35.870,0:30:42.830
and a half with tongue oh she was a

0:30:39.320,0:30:44.840
little bit ambitious there on her exit

0:30:42.830,0:30:47.150
of the dive so the come outs as we would

0:30:44.840,0:30:50.510
call it in diving where you are moving

0:30:47.150,0:30:52.880
from the position to the entry and she

0:30:50.510,0:30:54.500
decides to come out just a little bit

0:30:52.880,0:30:56.630
too early let's have a look here let's

0:30:54.500,0:30:58.610
go there point the toes towards the

0:30:56.630,0:31:00.920
swimming pool and that is too early and

0:30:58.610,0:31:02.600
therefore ends up short on the dive

0:31:00.920,0:31:06.470
we'll only get four and a half so I

0:31:02.600,0:31:07.820
would imagine for that and yeah I think

0:31:06.470,0:31:10.850
we'll see her back tomorrow the way

0:31:07.820,0:31:11.930
things looking with those marks 42 and

0:31:10.850,0:31:13.220
we should go I have to do a lot of

0:31:11.930,0:31:15.740
picking up in her the rest of her

0:31:13.220,0:31:17.270
program is not terribly difficult

0:31:15.740,0:31:19.070
there's another three point one

0:31:17.270,0:31:22.310
Francesca dollar pay we've seen how a

0:31:19.070,0:31:24.260
starling do a three point one yes her

0:31:22.310,0:31:32.720
version of the for three and a half of

0:31:24.260,0:31:33.890
Pike oh well done I say well done

0:31:32.720,0:31:35.270
because she was actually a little bit

0:31:33.890,0:31:37.610
back from the end of the diving board

0:31:35.270,0:31:39.500
which you'll see on the replay which

0:31:37.610,0:31:40.970
makes it even more difficult so not only

0:31:39.500,0:31:42.410
is it three point one you can see her

0:31:40.970,0:31:44.450
mouthing something to a coach a little

0:31:42.410,0:31:46.520
bit but from the end so she would have

0:31:44.450,0:31:48.530
taken a sharp intake of breath as I did

0:31:46.520,0:31:50.630
here in the commentary box but that's a

0:31:48.530,0:31:53.030
really good dive I'll get close to 70

0:31:50.630,0:31:54.410
points and that's all you need that's

0:31:53.030,0:31:56.540
what you need in this bloomer if you're

0:31:54.410,0:31:58.420
going close to 70 points you're going to

0:31:56.540,0:31:59.870
be in the business end of the field

0:31:58.420,0:32:02.030
conformation in

0:31:59.870,0:32:04.130
is around about the seventy sixty nine

0:32:02.030,0:32:08.630
point seven five three seven point five

0:32:04.130,0:32:12.650
for Francesca Donna pay of Italy and I

0:32:08.630,0:32:15.110
stays yeah yeah come up 2.8 live into

0:32:12.650,0:32:16.550
the three range yet for her with a for

0:32:15.110,0:32:18.530
three-and-a-half somersaults we've seen

0:32:16.550,0:32:22.160
that before but now the pike this time

0:32:18.530,0:32:23.990
there's one in the tuck position just a

0:32:22.160,0:32:27.740
little bit short of vertical as she goes

0:32:23.990,0:32:29.750
in it's all very neat all very tidy but

0:32:27.740,0:32:31.340
of course the judges you know the marks

0:32:29.750,0:32:31.940
are weighted towards the entry into the

0:32:31.340,0:32:34.910
water

0:32:31.940,0:32:38.090
beautiful toe point very aesthetically

0:32:34.910,0:32:39.380
pleasing in a diving clean and tidy

0:32:38.090,0:32:41.510
shapes you can see just short of

0:32:39.380,0:32:43.340
vertical there so that will cost her and

0:32:41.510,0:32:47.809
of course it's only two point eight

0:32:43.340,0:32:50.420
degree of difficulty yeah it's gonna put

0:32:47.809,0:32:52.760
a bit further behind from where she was

0:32:50.420,0:32:54.500
it says forth for time being but so

0:32:52.760,0:32:54.800
she's in the early stages of the second

0:32:54.500,0:32:57.230
round

0:32:54.800,0:33:02.030
very not gonna help her chances are

0:32:57.230,0:33:07.490
progression Nora schinsky 3.1 for her

0:33:02.030,0:33:10.820
now with the for three and a half it's

0:33:07.490,0:33:13.330
it's okay and it's a big it's a big risk

0:33:10.820,0:33:17.600
of course going for the three point one

0:33:13.330,0:33:20.720
because it's a tough tough dive does a

0:33:17.600,0:33:22.250
reasonable job here squeezing into that

0:33:20.720,0:33:23.929
Pike shape actually bending a knee

0:33:22.250,0:33:25.820
slightly the judges do not get the

0:33:23.929,0:33:27.559
benefits of the replay this has been a

0:33:25.820,0:33:29.510
little bit cheeky trying to squeeze the

0:33:27.559,0:33:31.390
dive in its low finishing on the water

0:33:29.510,0:33:34.970
but it's okay

0:33:31.390,0:33:37.400
singer marks mmm fifty five point eight

0:33:34.970,0:33:39.280
zero I'm sure she is okay she played a

0:33:37.400,0:33:41.809
little bit down on where she wants to be

0:33:39.280,0:33:45.350
nice young lady was 16 when she made her

0:33:41.809,0:33:48.230
Olympic Debbie and Beijing able going

0:33:45.350,0:33:51.830
for that one for three and a half again

0:33:48.230,0:33:54.230
with Pike now in contrast to the diver

0:33:51.830,0:33:56.510
before her Noah from Germany Jennifer

0:33:54.230,0:33:59.960
little smart looks like she's got

0:33:56.510,0:34:03.020
spring-loaded legs because she just pops

0:33:59.960,0:34:04.700
up out of the diving board into the into

0:34:03.020,0:34:07.400
the spin on this one let's have a look

0:34:04.700,0:34:09.290
at the replay look at the elevation here

0:34:07.400,0:34:11.960
up above the five meter board in the

0:34:09.290,0:34:13.540
background cruising the dive a little

0:34:11.960,0:34:17.470
bit over former vert

0:34:13.540,0:34:19.390
she went in but yeah cruising very

0:34:17.470,0:34:20.830
impressive coach is never happier though

0:34:19.390,0:34:22.419
there's always something but writing in

0:34:20.830,0:34:24.730
these she can because sixty six point

0:34:22.419,0:34:26.320
six five is decent mark room for

0:34:24.730,0:34:28.419
improvement that Alan Lindbergh um

0:34:26.320,0:34:29.770
Sweden won't give me a chance to tell

0:34:28.419,0:34:32.919
you about it she's gonna go straight

0:34:29.770,0:34:37.090
away oh that is nice

0:34:32.919,0:34:39.340
very very well executed good use of the

0:34:37.090,0:34:41.200
diving board so she really starts to get

0:34:39.340,0:34:42.910
it going walking down the diving board

0:34:41.200,0:34:45.490
there this is more of a jump hurdle

0:34:42.910,0:34:46.840
really launching herself into that you

0:34:45.490,0:34:48.490
know double feet on the end of the

0:34:46.840,0:34:50.290
diving board there to get enough height

0:34:48.490,0:34:53.800
in order to make that that's very neat

0:34:50.290,0:34:55.720
and very tidy mid-60s on shore still

0:34:53.800,0:34:58.420
more to come from this exciting Swedish

0:34:55.720,0:35:00.700
diver to about me they're very neat

0:34:58.420,0:35:03.550
great idea mid sixties sixty five point

0:35:00.700,0:35:06.660
one zero Anna Lindbergh and that lives

0:35:03.550,0:35:06.660
her up to fourth place

0:35:06.690,0:35:14.140
Christina Lucas don't hold back she says

0:35:11.950,0:35:17.940
do everything with confidence if she

0:35:14.140,0:35:17.940
does it on this reverse two and a half

0:35:18.630,0:35:23.230
yes she does and she was hanging ten as

0:35:21.520,0:35:25.660
well toes over the end of the diving

0:35:23.230,0:35:27.940
board but she certainly has the

0:35:25.660,0:35:29.440
confidence just stays with the technique

0:35:27.940,0:35:31.810
look at the toes all over the timing

0:35:29.440,0:35:34.710
board there but didn't seem to pull off

0:35:31.810,0:35:37.780
because that's very well executed

0:35:34.710,0:35:39.910
plunked it on her head little bit over a

0:35:37.780,0:35:42.370
vertical but still a this is the polymer

0:35:39.910,0:35:44.230
ease she doesn't need to be scoring

0:35:42.370,0:35:45.640
nines a little bit of a straddle

0:35:44.230,0:35:47.680
position there the judges won't see that

0:35:45.640,0:35:49.240
from the side she I think she needs to

0:35:47.680,0:35:51.460
see where she's been so she could spot

0:35:49.240,0:35:53.500
the dive well-well saved and where she

0:35:51.460,0:35:57.090
is at the moment is joint first with

0:35:53.500,0:35:59.410
Charlene Stratton is Laura Sanchez Sato

0:35:57.090,0:36:02.560
fifty-seven from the first round second

0:35:59.410,0:36:05.090
round dive is back two and a half with

0:36:02.560,0:36:08.570
Pike 3.0

0:36:05.090,0:36:10.880
yep steady on a head and that's what she

0:36:08.570,0:36:13.040
will be looking for it's the most

0:36:10.880,0:36:16.700
experienced so the Mexican divers in

0:36:13.040,0:36:18.890
this contest spinning backwards

0:36:16.700,0:36:22.280
squeezing into the Pike shape a little

0:36:18.890,0:36:23.660
bit of crimp in the pike there so just a

0:36:22.280,0:36:25.790
slight bend in the knees the judges

0:36:23.660,0:36:27.830
probably won't see that a real speed the

0:36:25.790,0:36:30.430
replays are just for our enjoyment and

0:36:27.830,0:36:34.490
for my analysis I hope is making sense

0:36:30.430,0:36:38.060
Laura Sanchez Soto 69 better effort than

0:36:34.490,0:36:43.460
the first which was 57 rhythmic gymnast

0:36:38.060,0:36:48.530
turned diving out of Malaysia for three

0:36:43.460,0:36:51.680
and a half with pike all just showing

0:36:48.530,0:36:54.290
you how difficult these dives up managed

0:36:51.680,0:36:56.870
to get the rotation working for so the

0:36:54.290,0:36:58.310
aerial work was good the all-important

0:36:56.870,0:36:59.600
entry into the water is what led her

0:36:58.310,0:37:02.210
down a little bit back from the end of

0:36:59.600,0:37:04.940
the diving board generates enough spin

0:37:02.210,0:37:06.710
but just stays with the spin a little

0:37:04.940,0:37:08.930
bit too long as you can see tidal wave a

0:37:06.710,0:37:11.090
little bit there not quite enough to get

0:37:08.930,0:37:14.750
your surfboard tight but probably not

0:37:11.090,0:37:16.610
enough for a good score score is 41

0:37:14.750,0:37:18.350
point eight five and Aang may be

0:37:16.610,0:37:20.420
thinking maybe I can go shopping

0:37:18.350,0:37:24.020
tomorrow I don't think I'll be back for

0:37:20.420,0:37:26.750
this Tanya Kenyatta just missing out on

0:37:24.020,0:37:29.620
the synchro bronze the other day yes her

0:37:26.750,0:37:32.570
forward two and a half with one twist Oh

0:37:29.620,0:37:34.510
beautiful entry into the water so having

0:37:32.570,0:37:37.720
a little bit of this over father there

0:37:34.510,0:37:41.690
four-time Olympic medalist in between

0:37:37.720,0:37:43.790
the dates up until 1980 but his daughter

0:37:41.690,0:37:46.160
looking for that elusive Olympic medal

0:37:43.790,0:37:48.140
this is her fourth Olympic Games and if

0:37:46.160,0:37:51.110
she continues to dive like that she'll

0:37:48.140,0:37:53.150
certainly be challenging but again this

0:37:51.110,0:37:55.760
is the prelims so no medals given away

0:37:53.150,0:37:58.310
today or tomorrow this is all about

0:37:55.760,0:38:00.590
shuffling the pack and near the top is

0:37:58.310,0:38:02.860
Miss Kenyatta no she's not near the top

0:38:00.590,0:38:05.180
she's at the top with that 72

0:38:02.860,0:38:06.740
straightaway Sean goes straight into a

0:38:05.180,0:38:10.010
dive I'll tell you about it afterwards

0:38:06.740,0:38:11.540
oh he will yeah he being me and there we

0:38:10.010,0:38:15.230
are forward three and a half in the tuck

0:38:11.540,0:38:17.090
position we've seen it before and that

0:38:15.230,0:38:19.820
was a really tidy effort

0:38:17.090,0:38:22.850
squeezing into the TUC shape in order to

0:38:19.820,0:38:25.700
spin and spin and spin doesn't take long

0:38:22.850,0:38:33.440
from takeoff to entry looking where you

0:38:25.700,0:38:38.870
going yet nice it's tidy 63/4 john hyung

0:38:33.440,0:38:40.420
joong of malaysia and she's up to ninth

0:38:38.870,0:38:43.610
place

0:38:40.420,0:38:45.320
Cassidy Krug of the USA both her parents

0:38:43.610,0:38:49.970
are diving coaches for three and a half

0:38:45.320,0:38:51.380
with Mike again 3.10 she was heading

0:38:49.970,0:38:53.290
towards the judges a little bit there

0:38:51.380,0:38:56.510
but it didn't seem to affect the dive

0:38:53.290,0:38:58.610
again very strong both both the American

0:38:56.510,0:39:00.740
girls obviously working very very hard

0:38:58.610,0:39:03.800
outside of the diving pool she's way

0:39:00.740,0:39:06.320
above the five meter there yeah you

0:39:03.800,0:39:08.450
could just see probably yeah see look at

0:39:06.320,0:39:10.310
this spinning towards the left-hand side

0:39:08.450,0:39:12.890
of the screen they're moving towards the

0:39:10.310,0:39:14.180
judges be interesting to see whether the

0:39:12.890,0:39:16.520
judges penalized or whether they

0:39:14.180,0:39:19.670
actually saw that but it's so it's okay

0:39:16.520,0:39:21.080
sevens will count 7.5 s and the sevens

0:39:19.670,0:39:25.040
with the line through them do not

0:39:21.080,0:39:27.920
towards the total 65 point one zero for

0:39:25.040,0:39:31.220
Krug there's da buzina

0:39:27.920,0:39:35.390
of Russia with her 2.8 for three and a

0:39:31.220,0:39:37.550
half very elegant

0:39:35.390,0:39:39.950
yeah opting for the the easier option

0:39:37.550,0:39:42.200
here only 2.8 degree of difficulty on

0:39:39.950,0:39:44.390
the forward three and a half somersaults

0:39:42.200,0:39:47.210
in the tuck position but let's just have

0:39:44.390,0:39:49.130
a look at the shape beautiful toe point

0:39:47.210,0:39:51.440
look how long a feet are in the toes

0:39:49.130,0:39:54.250
though it's and then glides out of it

0:39:51.440,0:39:57.770
very very pretty

0:39:54.250,0:39:59.180
tip the judges are great they always

0:39:57.770,0:40:00.560
agree with you Leon they couldn't do

0:39:59.180,0:40:05.210
anything else because a sixty one point

0:40:00.560,0:40:09.740
six zero it's okay sevens and two points

0:40:05.210,0:40:12.080
seven point five in that mix sorry for

0:40:09.740,0:40:14.060
this young go up opening dive because it

0:40:12.080,0:40:15.620
went rather wrong for a range of showers

0:40:14.060,0:40:19.090
when you're so hopefully the back two

0:40:15.620,0:40:22.450
and a half with Mike better

0:40:19.090,0:40:24.490
oh it does it goes much much better of

0:40:22.450,0:40:26.530
course making a complete ever on her

0:40:24.490,0:40:27.910
first I've landing but almost missing

0:40:26.530,0:40:30.370
the end of the diving port which

0:40:27.910,0:40:31.720
fortunately she didn't do but standing

0:40:30.370,0:40:35.290
backwards this time in the back two and

0:40:31.720,0:40:37.450
a half in the pike position much better

0:40:35.290,0:40:39.580
off a little bit well over a vertical as

0:40:37.450,0:40:41.560
she went in so the marks reflect that

0:40:39.580,0:40:44.470
six-and-a-half she'll be much much more

0:40:41.560,0:40:47.200
pleased with that I'm sure Bob 58.50 it

0:40:44.470,0:40:51.010
is for her but she has an awful lot of

0:40:47.200,0:40:54.880
ground to make up to make the top 18 as

0:40:51.010,0:40:57.250
he of China equal fourth after the first

0:40:54.880,0:40:58.450
round and here comes her forward three

0:40:57.250,0:41:03.460
and a half you'll see it's a lots been

0:40:58.450,0:41:05.560
the second round with pike well having a

0:41:03.460,0:41:07.330
good look at that before she punches

0:41:05.560,0:41:10.690
into the water looking for that rip

0:41:07.330,0:41:13.090
entry seems to be able to make the dive

0:41:10.690,0:41:15.550
we like much effort but of course that's

0:41:13.090,0:41:17.470
the key to this exceptional diving is

0:41:15.550,0:41:19.600
making something really difficult look

0:41:17.470,0:41:20.410
effortless and that's what her Z is

0:41:19.600,0:41:22.630
doing there

0:41:20.410,0:41:23.770
it'll get 8 that's the fault Crum of the

0:41:22.630,0:41:25.480
diamond board there that's the wheel

0:41:23.770,0:41:28.210
that the divers turned in order to make

0:41:25.480,0:41:32.440
it a little bit more flexible or not and

0:41:28.210,0:41:35.230
her Z there solid dive as you would

0:41:32.440,0:41:37.600
expect yep 70 2.85 doesn't quite put her

0:41:35.230,0:41:39.190
into first place yet scan yato is in the

0:41:37.600,0:41:42.670
lead not waiting for anybody's Feder

0:41:39.190,0:41:43.840
over here it's a good job I'm I'm awake

0:41:42.670,0:41:45.430
cuz I'd have missed that she was

0:41:43.840,0:41:47.740
couldn't wait to get a dive out the way

0:41:45.430,0:41:50.110
first round dive wasn't so hot second

0:41:47.740,0:41:53.200
mine time is good got some catching up

0:41:50.110,0:41:56.260
to do though experienced diver from the

0:41:53.200,0:41:58.750
Ukraine squeezing into the tuck shape

0:41:56.260,0:42:02.410
they're very very precise on the entry

0:41:58.750,0:42:04.690
eights across the board yes yeah didn't

0:42:02.410,0:42:06.010
wait for anybody entering that some

0:42:04.690,0:42:07.060
people tell you that they're patient

0:42:06.010,0:42:09.520
some people feel they need to get into

0:42:07.060,0:42:11.290
it straightaway and she did on any gap

0:42:09.520,0:42:13.330
between these scores coming up and her

0:42:11.290,0:42:15.730
dive now I'll give you a bit more time

0:42:13.330,0:42:18.760
to take over the end just layin Castillo

0:42:15.730,0:42:21.490
Suarez or Venezuela but again it's a low

0:42:18.760,0:42:23.790
tariff dive which has to be absolutely

0:42:21.490,0:42:23.790
spot-on

0:42:25.790,0:42:32.250
yep well it's it's on her head and you

0:42:29.849,0:42:34.560
know one of the only divers on Venezuela

0:42:32.250,0:42:36.960
here and she's done very well to make

0:42:34.560,0:42:39.480
the make the cut as in the Olympic

0:42:36.960,0:42:41.849
qualification cut the World Cup in this

0:42:39.480,0:42:44.900
event there are over 50 divers force

0:42:41.849,0:42:47.760
only 30 girls here today Olympic Games

0:42:44.900,0:42:50.369
is everyone's dream and she's here today

0:42:47.760,0:42:53.250
look at the expression that's how much

0:42:50.369,0:42:56.160
effort has to go in squeezing in those

0:42:53.250,0:42:57.630
knees towards the shoulders clunking it

0:42:56.160,0:42:59.580
on ahead there you go

0:42:57.630,0:43:02.910
on your head son fifty four point six

0:42:59.580,0:43:07.880
zero six point five walk out towards her

0:43:02.910,0:43:10.890
total now we'll Ming chef of China

0:43:07.880,0:43:12.390
neither after round one with 78 backing

0:43:10.890,0:43:15.690
it up with a reverse one and a half

0:43:12.390,0:43:20.010
somersaults two and a half twists yeah

0:43:15.690,0:43:21.420
it's a very easy dive I say easy that's

0:43:20.010,0:43:23.849
just she makes it look easy it's two

0:43:21.420,0:43:25.530
point nine so it needs to be very good

0:43:23.849,0:43:27.030
some of the girls you know in the twist

0:43:25.530,0:43:28.950
group going for the forward two and a

0:43:27.030,0:43:30.810
half one twist women showed you're much

0:43:28.950,0:43:31.920
more of a classic dive the reverse one

0:43:30.810,0:43:34.380
and a half there's a two and a half

0:43:31.920,0:43:36.869
twist she throws her arms out to the

0:43:34.380,0:43:39.510
side almost into a Y position boom there

0:43:36.869,0:43:42.330
you go and then sorts out that entry rip

0:43:39.510,0:43:44.790
entry hick on the nines come the girls

0:43:42.330,0:43:47.310
seventy eight point three zero the nines

0:43:44.790,0:43:51.890
walk out and she goes back to the top of

0:43:47.310,0:43:51.890
the pile above cameo toe and her Zee

0:43:55.940,0:44:02.640
seen Hannah Starling and Rebecca

0:43:59.930,0:44:04.320
gallantry going with her reverse

0:44:02.640,0:44:08.670
two-and-a-half with Mike three point

0:44:04.320,0:44:10.200
zero degree of difficulty oh it's it's

0:44:08.670,0:44:11.730
good it could have been a lot better

0:44:10.200,0:44:14.339
though she did all the hard work she

0:44:11.730,0:44:15.810
placed her feet towards the scoreboard

0:44:14.339,0:44:18.450
which is where they needed to go and

0:44:15.810,0:44:20.150
then for some reason GS pulled their

0:44:18.450,0:44:22.349
feet whither as she entered the water

0:44:20.150,0:44:23.760
squeezing into the Pike shape all looks

0:44:22.349,0:44:25.770
good here and they're just tips her feet

0:44:23.760,0:44:28.349
over at the last minute and then causes

0:44:25.770,0:44:31.440
that little bit of a mini tidal wave a

0:44:28.349,0:44:33.089
little bit skew if their judges would

0:44:31.440,0:44:37.619
probably penalize for that as well

0:44:33.089,0:44:39.060
they have there we go 54 love he worded

0:44:37.619,0:44:41.370
skew whiff into the College

0:44:39.060,0:44:45.270
sweet monkey that word now future

0:44:41.370,0:44:46.890
reference and yeah the grimace rather

0:44:45.270,0:44:49.650
the smile there from a Rebecca Gallen

0:44:46.890,0:44:51.630
treat and their perseverance can neither

0:44:49.650,0:44:54.930
reverse two and a half up to three for

0:44:51.630,0:44:57.060
her on the pike Wow she managed to well

0:44:54.930,0:44:59.190
a bit of a peculiar technique there I

0:44:57.060,0:45:01.260
won't go into it too much and battle you

0:44:59.190,0:45:03.780
would buy mechanics but her arms didn't

0:45:01.260,0:45:05.130
seem to swing very much at all or in the

0:45:03.780,0:45:07.590
right way and they were certainly been

0:45:05.130,0:45:09.960
losing a big back arch to get it get it

0:45:07.590,0:45:11.820
around well it seemed to work for her

0:45:09.960,0:45:13.340
because that's a reasonable effort six

0:45:11.820,0:45:15.810
is six and a half so I would imagine

0:45:13.340,0:45:18.030
here we go these elegant super

0:45:15.810,0:45:19.130
slow-motion shots but and yeah take it

0:45:18.030,0:45:22.200
from me that's alright

0:45:19.130,0:45:24.750
58.50 for an appeasement scoop course

0:45:22.200,0:45:27.270
the year diamond pit used by Ryan Lochte

0:45:24.750,0:45:28.980
and Michael Phelps last night to swim

0:45:27.270,0:45:31.050
down I didn't see them on the diving

0:45:28.980,0:45:32.760
board so Paula Nancy in between their

0:45:31.050,0:45:34.290
medal races obviously and they wouldn't

0:45:32.760,0:45:36.540
look right in this competition not a

0:45:34.290,0:45:38.670
right body shape I don't think forward

0:45:36.540,0:45:45.540
two and a half somersaults and one twist

0:45:38.670,0:45:48.090
for Bouvet are France oh it's okay again

0:45:45.540,0:45:50.070
this is a tricky dive 3.0 this is her

0:45:48.090,0:45:51.840
most difficult dive of her program and

0:45:50.070,0:45:54.030
she's put it second

0:45:51.840,0:45:55.230
so sometimes it's good to get it out the

0:45:54.030,0:45:56.640
way here we are one and a half

0:45:55.230,0:45:58.920
somersaults we've seen it before one

0:45:56.640,0:46:00.660
twist GS running out of room there but

0:45:58.920,0:46:03.420
she does manage to just to Mike get it

0:46:00.660,0:46:05.010
in in time only 18 years old first

0:46:03.420,0:46:05.640
Olympic Games for Fanny Bouvier from

0:46:05.010,0:46:07.830
France

0:46:05.640,0:46:15.890
I think she'll only be featuring in the

0:46:07.830,0:46:21.530
preliminaries Oh Bob six is for fanny 54

0:46:15.890,0:46:21.530
exactly and Noah to be back tomorrow

0:46:24.020,0:46:32.370
his Benitez are Spain and the female

0:46:29.220,0:46:34.200
diver from that country difficulty not

0:46:32.370,0:46:36.270
recruit me out much for her two point

0:46:34.200,0:46:39.050
eight on this back two and half summer

0:46:36.270,0:46:39.050
sorts with tuck

0:46:40.940,0:46:45.390
yes I think she has one of the lowest

0:46:43.440,0:46:47.520
degree of difficulty lists in this

0:46:45.390,0:46:49.680
competition which is gonna make it

0:46:47.520,0:46:51.660
difficult for her to make it past these

0:46:49.680,0:46:52.980
polymerase the tuck position is easier

0:46:51.660,0:46:54.570
than the pike position therefore it

0:46:52.980,0:46:56.690
carries a lower degree of difficulty

0:46:54.570,0:46:59.430
Jennifer is on a head there though

0:46:56.690,0:47:02.130
rubbing her hands in excitement ahead of

0:46:59.430,0:47:05.700
this second round dive let's see if the

0:47:02.130,0:47:06.830
judges of inputting scores make you

0:47:05.700,0:47:09.840
excited

0:47:06.830,0:47:11.910
don't you be upset particularly by those

0:47:09.840,0:47:14.280
marks but fifty eight point eight zero

0:47:11.910,0:47:16.230
probably not gonna help her in terms of

0:47:14.280,0:47:18.260
progression to the last sixteen that's

0:47:16.230,0:47:23.130
or the last eighteen tomorrow

0:47:18.260,0:47:26.430
Jennifer Benitez of Spain that was and

0:47:23.130,0:47:29.100
let's go on to junior Novello so our

0:47:26.430,0:47:31.740
Brazil and it's a back two and a half

0:47:29.100,0:47:34.230
several sorts with Pike for her second

0:47:31.740,0:47:36.060
round I 25th at the moment needs a big

0:47:34.230,0:47:40.200
improvement to me that last 16 with

0:47:36.060,0:47:42.990
three more rounds after this well that's

0:47:40.200,0:47:44.520
a little bit better it's she's working

0:47:42.990,0:47:46.710
the board a lot before she took off you

0:47:44.520,0:47:48.990
could see you know trying to generate a

0:47:46.710,0:47:51.720
little bit more energy through the toes

0:47:48.990,0:47:53.160
through into the diving board it kind of

0:47:51.720,0:47:55.980
worked for and leaning back a little bit

0:47:53.160,0:47:58.170
too far making the dive more complicated

0:47:55.980,0:48:00.720
to control arching into some kind of

0:47:58.170,0:48:02.040
banana shake but she goes in which of

0:48:00.720,0:48:06.240
course the judges won't be looking for

0:48:02.040,0:48:07.860
any bananas hungry anyway I wish we had

0:48:06.240,0:48:09.390
a commentary cam working here we do have

0:48:07.860,0:48:10.770
one Miss Ellie it's not linked up to see

0:48:09.390,0:48:15.590
some of the movements and Leon Taylor

0:48:10.770,0:48:15.590
they were fantastic we've seen time warp

0:48:16.490,0:48:21.870
on to jail Patrick almost radiates

0:48:20.160,0:48:24.120
forward to and off some sort someone

0:48:21.870,0:48:26.670
twists and pike and of course if you do

0:48:24.120,0:48:33.480
have any vacancies for a theater as you

0:48:26.670,0:48:36.270
man nice from jail very nice strong

0:48:33.480,0:48:39.660
Australian women's diving especially in

0:48:36.270,0:48:41.580
this springboard yeah big smiles from JL

0:48:39.660,0:48:43.020
and that's exactly exactly what back

0:48:41.580,0:48:45.150
from the end of the diving board though

0:48:43.020,0:48:47.790
that's not where she wants to be but

0:48:45.150,0:48:50.100
obviously you know very accomplished

0:48:47.790,0:48:53.410
diver so she can make these dives even

0:48:50.100,0:48:54.850
with a average takeoff

0:48:53.410,0:48:56.860
they average take off as it she did very

0:48:54.850,0:48:59.080
well but there she wasn't anywhere near

0:48:56.860,0:49:02.590
the end of the diving board yep

0:48:59.080,0:49:04.810
jl is up to ninth place with that dive

0:49:02.590,0:49:06.790
she should be comfortably through at

0:49:04.810,0:49:08.550
this stage anyway so all three more

0:49:06.790,0:49:13.570
rounds to go after this

0:49:08.550,0:49:16.210
Nora Bart up two point four second round

0:49:13.570,0:49:22.780
dive nice nails forward two and a half

0:49:16.210,0:49:25.870
summer sorts with pike yeah gamer

0:49:22.780,0:49:28.330
tactics going on here often uses two

0:49:25.870,0:49:30.820
forward three and a half and often

0:49:28.330,0:49:33.220
messes it up so she's she's opted for

0:49:30.820,0:49:35.230
the two-point for the forward two and a

0:49:33.220,0:49:37.330
half this is very very basic dive she's

0:49:35.230,0:49:39.910
got great height they're coming out

0:49:37.330,0:49:41.080
early she'll get seven and a half but

0:49:39.910,0:49:44.800
you know that's not going to give her a

0:49:41.080,0:49:46.510
much over fifty points and so yes she's

0:49:44.800,0:49:49.210
so down the bottom end of the pack I

0:49:46.510,0:49:52.300
would imagine let's have a look that she

0:49:49.210,0:49:53.860
is 21st well not that far down not

0:49:52.300,0:49:56.980
actually that far away from the top 18

0:49:53.860,0:50:00.430
that score of 54 that's some work to do

0:49:56.980,0:50:03.070
for Nora bata hit somebody started on

0:50:00.430,0:50:05.350
the platform came down to the three

0:50:03.070,0:50:07.990
meter board and really Haman's after

0:50:05.350,0:50:11.590
round one she's ninth round two she's

0:50:07.990,0:50:13.330
gonna perform again fairly low DD for

0:50:11.590,0:50:14.860
her forward three and a half somersaults

0:50:13.330,0:50:18.790
the reason for that it's in the Tuck

0:50:14.860,0:50:21.640
position yep same is the first round

0:50:18.790,0:50:23.680
dive emily has a long legs a very very

0:50:21.640,0:50:25.630
long legs in relation to her body which

0:50:23.680,0:50:27.520
means anything in the pike position is

0:50:25.630,0:50:29.350
even tougher for this young lady so

0:50:27.520,0:50:31.120
opting for the tuck which

0:50:29.350,0:50:33.430
biomechanically is easier and therefore

0:50:31.120,0:50:34.600
carries a lower degree of difficulty but

0:50:33.430,0:50:36.840
she's neat and tidy

0:50:34.600,0:50:40.000
she will be getting eights on that and

0:50:36.840,0:50:41.770
yep obviously a little toe shot there

0:50:40.000,0:50:44.800
for those of you that like feet there's

0:50:41.770,0:50:48.130
Emily's toes and into the water

0:50:44.800,0:50:49.450
I think the nail bars would do a

0:50:48.130,0:50:51.940
fantastic trade around here at the

0:50:49.450,0:50:55.750
moment 8.0 degree as degree of

0:50:51.940,0:50:57.850
difficulty points for Emily havens lifts

0:50:55.750,0:50:59.740
her up to 10th with that mark take her

0:50:57.850,0:51:03.160
total to one thirty four point seven

0:50:59.740,0:51:05.260
zero and finally Florida GaN dose of

0:51:03.160,0:51:08.920
Hungary comes

0:51:05.260,0:51:13.150
Tucker dive 2.7 inward two-and-a-half

0:51:08.920,0:51:15.910
somersaults she also has a nails done

0:51:13.150,0:51:17.680
the yeah the cameraman zooming in I

0:51:15.910,0:51:19.990
think there's a nail bar in the Olympic

0:51:17.680,0:51:21.430
Village and they're certainly cueing man

0:51:19.990,0:51:26.200
the corner or so it seems

0:51:21.430,0:51:28.510
flora gone dass only 20 years old yeah

0:51:26.200,0:51:31.180
it's an easy list easy degrees of

0:51:28.510,0:51:35.530
difficulty and I'm sure she's enjoying

0:51:31.180,0:51:36.700
her Olympic experience but maybe not

0:51:35.530,0:51:39.550
when she looks at the score more

0:51:36.700,0:51:45.280
particularly in 50 2.65 that's okay I

0:51:39.550,0:51:47.170
suppose on 2.7 and she is 25th she was

0:51:45.280,0:51:51.820
23 she dropped a couple of places from

0:51:47.170,0:51:55.080
round one to round two now here are the

0:51:51.820,0:51:59.920
main movers and shakers after round two

0:51:55.080,0:52:02.380
two Chinese in the top three and America

0:51:59.920,0:52:04.720
Australia Italy Canada another American

0:52:02.380,0:52:07.060
all the names you'd expect to see on the

0:52:04.720,0:52:09.340
front page pretty much that

0:52:07.060,0:52:13.300
and the Limbourg to just the top of page

0:52:09.340,0:52:15.280
two and going through to the series if

0:52:13.300,0:52:17.350
things stayed the way they are now

0:52:15.280,0:52:19.480
sterling in 14th place and Rebecca

0:52:17.350,0:52:23.380
gallantry in 15th missing out will be

0:52:19.480,0:52:24.970
anastasiya Pozniak over in 19th and to

0:52:23.380,0:52:28.990
catch a dick off his long way down

0:52:24.970,0:52:30.400
21 at the moment for the giant because

0:52:28.990,0:52:35.940
there are three more round and there's

0:52:30.400,0:52:35.940
plenty of marks at stake to be won yet

0:52:39.110,0:52:44.640
aren't around three and setting the

0:52:41.850,0:52:47.340
target and setting the standard for the

0:52:44.640,0:52:50.220
others the other 29 in the women 3-meter

0:52:47.340,0:52:54.960
springboard preliminary here charlene

0:52:50.220,0:52:58.170
stratton of australia and again at the

0:52:54.960,0:52:59.880
top of the range in terms of degree of

0:52:58.170,0:53:01.490
difficulty in this competition forward

0:52:59.880,0:53:03.780
three and a half summer sorts with pike

0:53:01.490,0:53:05.340
before my quite a few other divers in

0:53:03.780,0:53:16.980
the second round she's opted to go for

0:53:05.340,0:53:19.680
it as her first dive in round three well

0:53:16.980,0:53:24.540
it's a magnificent effort opening up the

0:53:19.680,0:53:27.300
third round here nods and smiles and

0:53:24.540,0:53:29.640
claps from the coaches again all about a

0:53:27.300,0:53:31.470
steady list of dives and that's three

0:53:29.640,0:53:34.980
out of three for charlene beautiful dive

0:53:31.470,0:53:38.670
up lovely young lady as well it was nice

0:53:34.980,0:53:41.070
to see her diving accordingly she trains

0:53:38.670,0:53:41.970
very very hard the hard works obviously

0:53:41.070,0:53:44.640
paying off

0:53:41.970,0:53:46.140
so charlene Stratton for the time being

0:53:44.640,0:53:49.500
obviously will go into the lead nice

0:53:46.140,0:53:52.320
solid bank of score 7267 point five zero

0:53:49.500,0:53:55.980
and sixty eight point two zero for her

0:53:52.320,0:53:57.750
third round she took off who was ninth

0:53:55.980,0:54:00.180
in rome at the world championships in

0:53:57.750,0:54:03.750
2009 is in danger of not making the

0:54:00.180,0:54:05.820
semi-final here where has to really get

0:54:03.750,0:54:09.030
into it to gear backward two and a half

0:54:05.820,0:54:13.310
somersaults in the pike position degree

0:54:09.030,0:54:13.310
of difficulty for catcher 3.0

0:54:13.760,0:54:19.800
not quite clicking into gear as my co

0:54:16.950,0:54:21.930
commentator suggested just gear just

0:54:19.800,0:54:25.230
bouncing out of its place there in the

0:54:21.930,0:54:28.230
box a little bit short vertical as she

0:54:25.230,0:54:29.700
enters the water so it is 3.0 it'll

0:54:28.230,0:54:30.980
probably get sixty points or there

0:54:29.700,0:54:35.610
abouts

0:54:30.980,0:54:39.150
yeah a little low on the water will that

0:54:35.610,0:54:42.150
help mmm not sure about that sixty is a

0:54:39.150,0:54:45.270
score after a fifty point four zero so

0:54:42.150,0:54:50.490
she's quite a long way buying the a ball

0:54:45.270,0:54:52.140
a star called Starling from Leeds seems

0:54:50.490,0:54:55.110
to be enjoy in the moment there Bob

0:54:52.140,0:54:56.520
youngest competitor Wow composure look

0:54:55.110,0:54:59.010
at the referee looking at the crowd

0:54:56.520,0:55:00.990
trying to pick out some faces needs to

0:54:59.010,0:55:02.690
think about her dive of course that's

0:55:00.990,0:55:04.980
the most important reason why she's here

0:55:02.690,0:55:10.400
it's a reverse two and a half summer

0:55:04.980,0:55:10.400
sorts with pike 14th after round two

0:55:10.970,0:55:21.870
sterling oh it's a superb takeoff

0:55:18.210,0:55:24.870
fantastic aerial working just an error

0:55:21.870,0:55:26.310
of judgment on the finish there look at

0:55:24.870,0:55:28.440
this she's way up in the air just

0:55:26.310,0:55:30.860
pointing her toes a little bit too far

0:55:28.440,0:55:34.020
up and therefore tipping over a vertical

0:55:30.860,0:55:35.640
she needed to be out of that dive a

0:55:34.020,0:55:37.470
little bit earlier there's the chamois

0:55:35.640,0:55:39.360
I'll explain more about that throwing it

0:55:37.470,0:55:41.460
to a coach headwind Yong Yong's if we

0:55:39.360,0:55:43.500
were in baseball that would have been

0:55:41.460,0:55:47.220
good but we're in diving and she tips

0:55:43.500,0:55:50.540
over a vertical still oh what a shame

0:55:47.220,0:55:52.650
well the second cricket test between

0:55:50.540,0:55:54.390
England South Africa's taking place in

0:55:52.650,0:55:56.100
Leeds which is the club that she's from

0:55:54.390,0:56:01.950
that was a gun down very well at hitting

0:55:56.100,0:56:04.340
Lee now on to the Frenchwoman Marianna

0:56:01.950,0:56:07.530
foressi a is moving up to the threes now

0:56:04.340,0:56:11.430
it's gonna be a backwards two and a half

0:56:07.530,0:56:15.630
summer sorts with pike she's 28 needs to

0:56:11.430,0:56:17.520
get moving pretty quickly oh I think

0:56:15.630,0:56:19.350
she's only moving in one direction and

0:56:17.520,0:56:21.600
that isn't the direction she wants to be

0:56:19.350,0:56:23.880
moving in I don't think that'll move her

0:56:21.600,0:56:25.470
anywhere but backwards and that was the

0:56:23.880,0:56:29.580
backward two and a half in the pike

0:56:25.470,0:56:34.710
position seem to be okay until then and

0:56:29.580,0:56:36.510
she was just maybe she fell asleep well

0:56:34.710,0:56:38.070
judges can't see that from the side but

0:56:36.510,0:56:40.080
she went into the straddle position as

0:56:38.070,0:56:44.760
she went man they ended up over vertical

0:56:40.080,0:56:47.070
no marks of any note anyway forty point

0:56:44.760,0:56:49.500
five zero will count yes one of those

0:56:47.070,0:56:52.680
kind of days it's not gonna be her day

0:56:49.500,0:56:53.880
unfortunately as it could be fair this

0:56:52.680,0:56:55.860
woman certainly in terms of

0:56:53.880,0:56:58.310
qualification anyway looking nice and

0:56:55.860,0:57:01.490
comfortable very solid so far

0:56:58.310,0:57:03.260
Francesca della pate of Italy backward

0:57:01.490,0:57:07.310
two and a half somersaults Pike position

0:57:03.260,0:57:09.260
difficulty 3.0 fine she gets this right

0:57:07.310,0:57:10.940
makes you start to think about where she

0:57:09.260,0:57:15.860
gonna be tomorrow afternoon I'll be back

0:57:10.940,0:57:17.470
here for the semi-finals yet she's

0:57:15.860,0:57:20.120
really come on over the past few years

0:57:17.470,0:57:23.210
partnered with tanyaconnor Otto as a

0:57:20.120,0:57:25.300
synchro pairing and Tonya has been

0:57:23.210,0:57:27.590
bringing her on and this girl is so

0:57:25.300,0:57:29.420
exceptional diver in her own right

0:57:27.590,0:57:31.970
that's probably her weakest one of the

0:57:29.420,0:57:34.280
three so far only get five and a half

0:57:31.970,0:57:36.830
six is potentially for that because of

0:57:34.280,0:57:40.070
the the arch in the back cause she went

0:57:36.830,0:57:43.670
into the water yeah a little bit more of

0:57:40.070,0:57:48.770
a banana time I'm hot I'm sure no no

0:57:43.670,0:57:52.520
whore I am sure I heard a big scream but

0:57:48.770,0:57:57.380
she yet she left the board there so I'm

0:57:52.520,0:58:02.870
still laughing at your Anastasia boss

0:57:57.380,0:58:05.680
yeah cover a backward to allow service

0:58:02.870,0:58:05.680
sorts with pike

0:58:16.560,0:58:24.270
oh no well Anna stay you're moving

0:58:21.470,0:58:25.770
moving her degree of difficulty up and

0:58:24.270,0:58:27.090
the quality of her dive down

0:58:25.770,0:58:29.280
simultaneously

0:58:27.090,0:58:31.560
yeah the expression says it all from the

0:58:29.280,0:58:33.480
coach back two and a half in a pike

0:58:31.560,0:58:36.810
position letting go way too early

0:58:33.480,0:58:38.220
super March losing the legs oh dear oh

0:58:36.810,0:58:43.020
dear indeed

0:58:38.220,0:58:44.970
I says yeah Pozniak avert he's having a

0:58:43.020,0:58:47.100
bit of a poor day forty six point five

0:58:44.970,0:58:49.680
zero slips still further down the

0:58:47.100,0:58:54.120
rankings time to go and contemplate in

0:58:49.680,0:58:57.120
the old hot tub nor at sub schinsky of

0:58:54.120,0:58:59.070
germany we have her round 3 dive and

0:58:57.120,0:59:00.450
she's opted to go away from the board

0:58:59.070,0:59:02.640
there backward two and a half

0:59:00.450,0:59:05.250
somersaults with mike 3.0 degree of

0:59:02.640,0:59:08.820
difficulty and she is right on the cusp

0:59:05.250,0:59:11.220
of qualification seventeenth so

0:59:08.820,0:59:19.260
underline that progression with a good

0:59:11.220,0:59:23.640
dive here oh that's much better

0:59:19.260,0:59:26.430
yep she knew that she had to step up a

0:59:23.640,0:59:27.930
gear only in 17th and wants to be a

0:59:26.430,0:59:30.180
little bit further in the pack and

0:59:27.930,0:59:34.140
that's a good third round dive there

0:59:30.180,0:59:36.930
from the German yeah straight up and

0:59:34.140,0:59:40.380
dime that will get 60-odd to the early

0:59:36.930,0:59:42.270
60s super slow-mo you can see the

0:59:40.380,0:59:44.970
expressions on the faces I love it those

0:59:42.270,0:59:47.370
great photos online over divers with

0:59:44.970,0:59:50.520
some strained expressions on the face

0:59:47.370,0:59:52.470
mid dive 63 that's okay

0:59:50.520,0:59:55.020
it's not a bad little progression of

0:59:52.470,0:59:58.700
dives from the 50s up to the 60s now for

0:59:55.020,1:00:00.930
her Jennifer Abel nice comfortable

0:59:58.700,1:00:02.370
qualification place at number seven with

1:00:00.930,1:00:07.460
a reverse two and a half summer sorts

1:00:02.370,1:00:11.520
with pike oh yeah so much power up

1:00:07.460,1:00:12.780
technically she's good a little bit the

1:00:11.520,1:00:14.430
feet landing on the end of the diving

1:00:12.780,1:00:15.960
board there seem to be one foot in front

1:00:14.430,1:00:18.390
of the other not quite sure why that was

1:00:15.960,1:00:22.740
look you can see that Eagle Eye spotting

1:00:18.390,1:00:24.270
that she does a good job and saving the

1:00:22.740,1:00:26.040
dive they're given the impression that

1:00:24.270,1:00:27.960
she isn't going over a vertical when

1:00:26.040,1:00:29.650
actually the rotation was nudging her in

1:00:27.960,1:00:33.520
that direction

1:00:29.650,1:00:34.150
he likes it and so do the judges yeah

1:00:33.520,1:00:36.640
they do

1:00:34.150,1:00:38.230
seventeen point five zero the marks that

1:00:36.640,1:00:40.600
count the ones without the line struck

1:00:38.230,1:00:43.150
through eight and a seven point five

1:00:40.600,1:00:45.370
will count towards her total and the

1:00:43.150,1:00:48.360
Lindbergh straight into her reverse

1:00:45.370,1:00:51.460
two-and-a-half summer sorts with pike oh

1:00:48.360,1:00:54.040
well Tanana was a little bit slow on the

1:00:51.460,1:00:57.730
rotation and that meant that she had to

1:00:54.040,1:01:00.250
play the waiting game reverse two and a

1:00:57.730,1:01:02.680
half in the pike position here she goes

1:01:00.250,1:01:04.780
beautiful board timing up jumping away

1:01:02.680,1:01:06.520
from the diving board there we go

1:01:04.780,1:01:09.090
pointing the toes directly up in the air

1:01:06.520,1:01:12.340
and she fixes it that'll get sevens

1:01:09.090,1:01:15.490
steady steady Eddie wins race or steady

1:01:12.340,1:01:18.760
Anna gets into the semi-finals well on

1:01:15.490,1:01:21.850
the way two more rounds to go 63s there

1:01:18.760,1:01:23.050
for Evelyn Berg from a distance is

1:01:21.850,1:01:24.930
telling you exactly where she went wrong

1:01:23.050,1:01:26.920
what she needs to do in the future but

1:01:24.930,1:01:28.750
she'll be back for tomorrow

1:01:26.920,1:01:32.140
tomorrow unless something goes right

1:01:28.750,1:01:35.130
untoward in the last two rounds from the

1:01:32.140,1:01:37.210
Swede to the American at Kristina Lucas

1:01:35.130,1:01:40.270
we're two and a half service walk with

1:01:37.210,1:01:41.920
Pike experienced divers taking just a

1:01:40.270,1:01:44.200
little bit longer to prepare themselves

1:01:41.920,1:01:45.640
for their dives ones were rushing him

1:01:44.200,1:01:50.860
tend to be the ones who are not in the

1:01:45.640,1:01:56.640
top eighteen at the moment strong

1:01:50.860,1:01:56.640
powerful precise everything you need

1:01:57.800,1:02:04.760
really really steady solid confident

1:02:00.800,1:02:06.650
consistent beautiful pike shape straight

1:02:04.760,1:02:09.230
up in time I've seen it better it's

1:02:06.650,1:02:15.470
gonna get seven 7s across the board on a

1:02:09.230,1:02:19.280
3.0 steady steady steady seven seven

1:02:15.470,1:02:21.890
seven and sixty three with the marks

1:02:19.280,1:02:23.990
that are probably working out now that

1:02:21.890,1:02:28.390
makes 21 times it by three and you get

1:02:23.990,1:02:32.750
63 Laura Sanchez Soto

1:02:28.390,1:02:36.800
13th after round two it's a reverse two

1:02:32.750,1:02:38.810
and a half with pike she's done very

1:02:36.800,1:02:41.089
well a little bit back from the end of

1:02:38.810,1:02:43.310
the diving boards here we comment on

1:02:41.089,1:02:45.050
that quite a lot because it's so

1:02:43.310,1:02:46.849
unsteady in as you're taking off on the

1:02:45.050,1:02:48.320
springboard if you're not back from the

1:02:46.849,1:02:50.240
end especially reverse that means you

1:02:48.320,1:02:51.830
have to jump high by moving your hips

1:02:50.240,1:02:54.109
forward in order to generate the

1:02:51.830,1:02:55.849
rotation and that's why she had some

1:02:54.109,1:02:57.230
challenges on the finish of her dive

1:02:55.849,1:03:01.099
there as she entered the water a little

1:02:57.230,1:03:02.630
bit over a vertical as you can see feet

1:03:01.099,1:03:06.109
tipping over back towards the diving

1:03:02.630,1:03:07.010
board she saved it okay and stays in

1:03:06.109,1:03:09.380
contention

1:03:07.010,1:03:11.839
I think judges just about spotted that

1:03:09.380,1:03:16.609
they did seven and 6.5 will count

1:03:11.839,1:03:22.250
towards her total of 60 now egg of

1:03:16.609,1:03:25.310
Malaysia the heavily taped feet back two

1:03:22.250,1:03:27.320
and a half and 26 for the moment so if

1:03:25.310,1:03:33.619
this goes wrong probably not gonna be

1:03:27.320,1:03:34.280
back tomorrow yet probably needs to be

1:03:33.619,1:03:38.330
better than that

1:03:34.280,1:03:42.070
in order to move up the rankings move up

1:03:38.330,1:03:44.450
the field first Olympic Games only 19

1:03:42.070,1:03:46.490
she's got massive amounts of potential

1:03:44.450,1:03:48.140
and it's a big hard dive you know list

1:03:46.490,1:03:50.000
of dives that she's doing she's not

1:03:48.140,1:03:51.619
playing it safe and when you're not

1:03:50.000,1:03:53.690
playing it safe you're increasing the

1:03:51.619,1:03:56.140
risk by increasing the degree of

1:03:53.690,1:03:56.140
difficulty

1:03:57.330,1:04:03.520
fives and a 6.0 will count towards fifty

1:04:01.240,1:04:05.650
two point five zeros kind of resigned

1:04:03.520,1:04:08.970
look at her face again yeah okay I

1:04:05.650,1:04:12.130
should've done wrong I'm better but

1:04:08.970,1:04:13.630
India can yato for three and a half with

1:04:12.130,1:04:16.630
Pike three point one degree of

1:04:13.630,1:04:17.410
difficulty on this it's a big dive from

1:04:16.630,1:04:20.830
Kenyatta

1:04:17.410,1:04:22.360
three point one just rolling over as she

1:04:20.830,1:04:24.850
went into the water you'll see on the

1:04:22.360,1:04:26.950
replays she enters the water letting her

1:04:24.850,1:04:28.990
feet go over from vertical yes she did

1:04:26.950,1:04:30.790
all the hard work yeah yeah it's all

1:04:28.990,1:04:33.580
good tucking your chin in slightly

1:04:30.790,1:04:35.890
rolling over a little bit which means

1:04:33.580,1:04:38.560
it'll only gets sixes it's three point

1:04:35.890,1:04:40.000
one so it's not going to be well it's

1:04:38.560,1:04:41.770
not it's not all over that's for sure

1:04:40.000,1:04:43.210
but she'll move down the pack because of

1:04:41.770,1:04:45.880
that I think she's giving herself

1:04:43.210,1:04:47.230
probably enough of a buffer from the its

1:04:45.880,1:04:47.770
first few rounds not to worry about that

1:04:47.230,1:04:50.290
too much

1:04:47.770,1:04:51.520
fifty five point eight zero or can the

1:04:50.290,1:04:54.960
other but certainly the weakest of the

1:04:51.520,1:04:57.400
three dives so far Jung Hyung chunk of

1:04:54.960,1:04:58.060
Malaysia reverse two and a half with

1:04:57.400,1:05:03.220
Mike

1:04:58.060,1:05:06.370
she is 16th after two rounds oh not so

1:05:03.220,1:05:08.920
good from young a little bit ambitious

1:05:06.370,1:05:10.030
when she left she was letting go over

1:05:08.920,1:05:11.590
legs way too early

1:05:10.030,1:05:13.540
obviously the divers on this particular

1:05:11.590,1:05:15.550
dive you're watching where you've been

1:05:13.540,1:05:16.870
rather than where you're going so she

1:05:15.550,1:05:18.730
looks at the water and thinks she's

1:05:16.870,1:05:21.820
higher than she is points the toes down

1:05:18.730,1:05:24.010
at the water which is way way too early

1:05:21.820,1:05:26.860
ends up shorter vertical splash going

1:05:24.010,1:05:29.590
away from the diving board there work to

1:05:26.860,1:05:34.120
do for you and oh dear

1:05:29.590,1:05:35.920
thirty thirty know well that I think the

1:05:34.120,1:05:38.200
work has probably already done something

1:05:35.920,1:05:41.980
the great day's work for it that's the

1:05:38.200,1:05:43.720
krug of the u.s. eight a champagne

1:05:41.980,1:05:47.200
performance and Krug on this back two

1:05:43.720,1:05:48.970
and a half should probably keep the the

1:05:47.200,1:05:51.400
cork in the champagne at the moment a

1:05:48.970,1:05:53.470
long way to go yet got to get through

1:05:51.400,1:05:55.570
these preliminaries and they're gonna do

1:05:53.470,1:05:57.160
it all again in the semi-finals both

1:05:55.570,1:05:58.050
Americans here having a good day at the

1:05:57.160,1:06:00.160
office

1:05:58.050,1:06:01.840
landing on the heads a little bit over a

1:06:00.160,1:06:06.580
vertical their six six and a half

1:06:01.840,1:06:08.740
probably 3.0 it'll keep over well

1:06:06.580,1:06:10.460
maybe move it down slightly but she's

1:06:08.740,1:06:13.559
got a bit of a buffer

1:06:10.460,1:06:14.280
well the moment quite a few divers still

1:06:13.559,1:06:17.970
to go

1:06:14.280,1:06:19.020
she is v means a top 18 place he's at

1:06:17.970,1:06:21.270
the moment assured

1:06:19.020,1:06:28.520
two more rounds though to come after

1:06:21.270,1:06:34.440
this there's that buzina of a rush up

1:06:28.520,1:06:37.559
was 10th in Shanghai last year back two

1:06:34.440,1:06:39.960
and a half summer sorts with pike mr.

1:06:37.559,1:06:40.829
dyes are very similar for up many of the

1:06:39.960,1:06:43.770
competitors hit

1:06:40.829,1:06:44.730
there's her third round dive oh that's

1:06:43.770,1:06:47.039
much better

1:06:44.730,1:06:48.450
really really classy actually you can

1:06:47.039,1:06:50.010
see why she made a final last year at

1:06:48.450,1:06:51.900
the World Championships in Shanghai and

1:06:50.010,1:06:53.940
even getting a rapturous applause there

1:06:51.900,1:06:55.799
from a coach and the Russian coach is

1:06:53.940,1:06:58.950
not shown for showing very much emotion

1:06:55.799,1:07:01.859
if you're diving well or not but Nantou

1:06:58.950,1:07:05.130
is no dead CEO is the only Russian in

1:07:01.859,1:07:07.950
the mix at the moment get over 65 I'm

1:07:05.130,1:07:11.670
sure and and it stays yet it's got a lot

1:07:07.950,1:07:15.319
of work to do 60 7.50

1:07:11.670,1:07:18.559
for her up to sixth place at the moment

1:07:15.319,1:07:21.299
young lady was in a bit of trouble

1:07:18.559,1:07:23.250
because she's possibly the pack it's

1:07:21.299,1:07:25.200
probably better known for a 1 meter 3

1:07:23.250,1:07:26.910
meter here comes a reverse two and a

1:07:25.200,1:07:30.450
half summer sorts with pike on the

1:07:26.910,1:07:32.460
slightly higher board well she got a

1:07:30.450,1:07:34.680
take off right then the first dive that

1:07:32.460,1:07:36.809
she did she was way over the end in fact

1:07:34.680,1:07:38.789
she only had half a foot of each foot on

1:07:36.809,1:07:40.410
the diving board if that makes sense

1:07:38.789,1:07:43.200
this time she landed on the end of the

1:07:40.410,1:07:44.819
diving board not quite on the end but

1:07:43.200,1:07:47.220
good enough his reverse two and a half

1:07:44.819,1:07:49.380
but playing it safe thinking that she

1:07:47.220,1:07:51.960
was lower than she was points two toes

1:07:49.380,1:07:55.529
up towards the ceiling here we go Surf's

1:07:51.960,1:07:57.329
Up this is not gonna make Pleasant

1:07:55.529,1:07:59.730
looking for her in terms of marks

1:07:57.329,1:08:02.369
talking about four four and four point

1:07:59.730,1:08:05.369
five and thirty seven point five zero

1:08:02.369,1:08:11.089
will not get it done for a semi final

1:08:05.369,1:08:14.579
place for her on to hers eat of China

1:08:11.089,1:08:16.920
third place back two and a half summer

1:08:14.579,1:08:19.410
sorts with Pike third place China one

1:08:16.920,1:08:22.389
and three after run over to she's in

1:08:19.410,1:08:28.060
third it's her third round dive

1:08:22.389,1:08:31.989
oh that's more like it from her has he

1:08:28.060,1:08:34.150
already Olympic champion and looking for

1:08:31.989,1:08:35.650
another medal head to head with her

1:08:34.150,1:08:36.310
teammate and the rest of the field but

1:08:35.650,1:08:40.060
her teammate

1:08:36.310,1:08:43.000
whoo we're becoming shortly is it worth

1:08:40.060,1:08:44.739
a nine yeah I'd say the judges would

1:08:43.000,1:08:47.889
probably go eight and a half nine on

1:08:44.739,1:08:50.020
that beautiful here we are squeezing

1:08:47.889,1:08:52.480
into that Pike shape finishing by

1:08:50.020,1:08:55.270
board-level cruising into the water not

1:08:52.480,1:08:58.000
much splash and the biggest mark we have

1:08:55.270,1:08:59.739
seen so far today 3.0 degree of

1:08:58.000,1:09:05.679
difficulty producing a seventy nine

1:08:59.739,1:09:07.779
point five zero dive for her Z they no

1:09:05.679,1:09:09.609
filler over who rather rushed her first

1:09:07.779,1:09:11.650
two round dives and then get a chance to

1:09:09.609,1:09:13.690
tell you much about them backward two

1:09:11.650,1:09:17.500
and half somersaults with Pike 3.0

1:09:13.690,1:09:19.299
degree of difficulty just about give you

1:09:17.500,1:09:21.609
enough time to to tell us what the dive

1:09:19.299,1:09:25.060
was Bob there before she left from the

1:09:21.609,1:09:27.429
springboard obviously wanting to get

1:09:25.060,1:09:30.190
this competition out of the way and

1:09:27.429,1:09:31.750
let's see where she is after this cuz

1:09:30.190,1:09:33.880
that's a better effort but she's left

1:09:31.750,1:09:36.130
herself a little bit too much to do arm

1:09:33.880,1:09:38.170
swing generation of the power needed to

1:09:36.130,1:09:41.190
leap up squeezing into the pike shape

1:09:38.170,1:09:45.790
it'll get sevens which is pretty good

1:09:41.190,1:09:48.460
and at the moment up to 12th position so

1:09:45.790,1:09:52.480
she's flirting on the margins our

1:09:48.460,1:09:53.170
qualification for tomorrow just Lena

1:09:52.480,1:09:57.219
Castillo

1:09:53.170,1:10:00.790
Suarez in the last qualification place

1:09:57.219,1:10:02.139
at the moment eighteenth it's not gonna

1:10:00.790,1:10:04.360
help that she's got a two-point eight

1:10:02.139,1:10:07.810
dive here two and a half with target

1:10:04.360,1:10:09.670
needs to be very Oh what happened here I

1:10:07.810,1:10:12.639
can explain that so that is actually a

1:10:09.670,1:10:13.989
technical restart the crowd getting

1:10:12.639,1:10:16.119
behind it to encourage this and what

1:10:13.989,1:10:19.480
will happen now she will perform the

1:10:16.119,1:10:21.790
dive the the judges will mark out of ten

1:10:19.480,1:10:24.790
as normal but there will be a two-point

1:10:21.790,1:10:27.730
deduction from each of the judges for

1:10:24.790,1:10:29.650
the restart so I think she stopped

1:10:27.730,1:10:30.310
because for some reason she balked out

1:10:29.650,1:10:33.010
of balance

1:10:30.310,1:10:37.719
here we go attempt number two

1:10:33.010,1:10:40.630
oh what a shame it's actually a very

1:10:37.719,1:10:42.909
good dive it's technically precise she

1:10:40.630,1:10:45.460
would probably get sevens but those 7s

1:10:42.909,1:10:47.650
will have two marks taken off so I'll

1:10:45.460,1:10:49.750
show you when it comes to screen there

1:10:47.650,1:10:51.309
we are finally gets to take off in first

1:10:49.750,1:10:53.469
time we've seen a restart here it's a

1:10:51.309,1:10:55.030
beautiful dive what a shame

1:10:53.469,1:10:56.920
so she was flirting on the edge of the

1:10:55.030,1:10:59.860
semi-finals that isn't going to help her

1:10:56.920,1:11:02.139
campaign so let's see how does this get

1:10:59.860,1:11:03.969
imported by the time I'm not sure what

1:11:02.139,1:11:05.920
we see on our display here so the judges

1:11:03.969,1:11:07.929
will mark out of ten and then it will be

1:11:05.920,1:11:09.849
recalculated okay so those are the marks

1:11:07.929,1:11:12.880
but if you see all those marks seven

1:11:09.849,1:11:15.280
reads five 7.5 reads five point five and

1:11:12.880,1:11:17.530
seven reads five that gives a total of

1:11:15.280,1:11:19.630
43 so what we're seeing there are the

1:11:17.530,1:11:21.789
actual scores the judges put in and then

1:11:19.630,1:11:23.019
the calculation takes place off your

1:11:21.789,1:11:24.250
screen a good job I know what I'm on

1:11:23.019,1:11:26.219
about isn't it otherwise that would be

1:11:24.250,1:11:27.719
really confusing we didn't know you did

1:11:26.219,1:11:31.719
maybe I don't

1:11:27.719,1:11:35.139
we'll make sure in the lead after round

1:11:31.719,1:11:39.039
two it was just emptying the bins when I

1:11:35.139,1:11:41.429
came in 150 6.30 accumulated from the

1:11:39.039,1:11:44.349
first two rounds and here she goes with

1:11:41.429,1:11:46.480
3.1 so she's just upping the degree of

1:11:44.349,1:11:48.280
difficulty a little bit forward three

1:11:46.480,1:11:53.980
and a half some sorts with pike for the

1:11:48.280,1:11:55.119
leader oh not so good from Wu she was

1:11:53.980,1:11:56.980
actually over the end of the diving

1:11:55.119,1:11:58.539
board which is what we've seen from a

1:11:56.980,1:12:01.300
couple of the athletes so far today

1:11:58.539,1:12:03.010
makes it very difficult hopefully when

1:12:01.300,1:12:06.010
we get around to the replay I can show

1:12:03.010,1:12:09.010
you here we go so look at this toes over

1:12:06.010,1:12:10.750
the end of the diving board squeezing

1:12:09.010,1:12:13.150
into the Pike shape but a little bit low

1:12:10.750,1:12:14.559
on the water it's neat and tidy but it

1:12:13.150,1:12:17.440
shouldn't really get more than a six and

1:12:14.559,1:12:19.119
a half in my opinion but as she's such

1:12:17.440,1:12:21.870
an exceptional athlete maybe the judges

1:12:19.119,1:12:26.140
will go with her and they do

1:12:21.870,1:12:27.550
yeah 7 and 1/7 that's a little bit

1:12:26.140,1:12:31.200
higher than it ought to have been

1:12:27.550,1:12:35.560
she moves down into second place though

1:12:31.200,1:12:37.870
now Rebecca Gallen tree up into the

1:12:35.560,1:12:39.760
higher stakes pick your chips if you

1:12:37.870,1:12:41.200
like three point one on the you for

1:12:39.760,1:12:43.750
three and a half somersaults with pike

1:12:41.200,1:12:47.410
15th and the moment and going forward if

1:12:43.750,1:12:49.770
she can get this right yes that's much

1:12:47.410,1:12:51.400
better for it yeah whoo

1:12:49.770,1:12:54.400
struggling a little bit on this

1:12:51.400,1:12:57.060
particular dive so Rebecca doing very

1:12:54.400,1:12:59.920
well to follow the Olympic champion

1:12:57.060,1:13:03.010
here we go squeezing into that Pike

1:12:59.920,1:13:05.880
shape plenty of high enough drop time

1:13:03.010,1:13:08.500
it's steady it's into the water

1:13:05.880,1:13:09.970
seven seven point five so I would guess

1:13:08.500,1:13:13.390
and that will help because it's three

1:13:09.970,1:13:15.340
point one they like it they like it very

1:13:13.390,1:13:17.410
much indeed I do love that dress

1:13:15.340,1:13:17.850
probably wouldn't fit me but I do like

1:13:17.410,1:13:21.370
it

1:13:17.850,1:13:24.370
Rebecca Gavin tree with sixty nine point

1:13:21.370,1:13:26.350
seven five three lots of sevens will

1:13:24.370,1:13:28.300
count towards her target now Miss Wentz

1:13:26.350,1:13:31.060
go ones get things going pretty quickly

1:13:28.300,1:13:33.100
and they're getting going quickly oh yes

1:13:31.060,1:13:35.530
she is getting it quickly but not in the

1:13:33.100,1:13:36.880
right way just attack in the end of the

1:13:35.530,1:13:38.230
diving board they're getting into the

1:13:36.880,1:13:39.610
dive probably a little bit too quickly

1:13:38.230,1:13:41.620
not waiting for the diving board to

1:13:39.610,1:13:44.320
throw up in fact she's miles back from

1:13:41.620,1:13:45.640
the end running out a room here and

1:13:44.320,1:13:48.670
definitely needs a three and a half

1:13:45.640,1:13:50.140
meter platform yeah not good from the

1:13:48.670,1:13:53.200
second of the Ukrainians we've seen this

1:13:50.140,1:13:55.660
morning and she went so quickly I didn't

1:13:53.200,1:13:59.740
get a chance to comment on Bob's dress

1:13:55.660,1:14:03.160
that he quite likes in the audience just

1:13:59.740,1:14:04.570
as Willie is off screen isn't it I did

1:14:03.160,1:14:10.780
dress up for today word didn't quite

1:14:04.570,1:14:13.120
work obviously now family move a 2.8

1:14:10.780,1:14:15.940
where the backward two and a half

1:14:13.120,1:14:17.590
somersaults round three dive two point

1:14:15.940,1:14:20.020
eight she's not really pushing the boat

1:14:17.590,1:14:22.600
out today is she in terms of wanted to

1:14:20.020,1:14:25.270
progress almost like she's wanting a bit

1:14:22.600,1:14:28.960
of experience for next time she is

1:14:25.270,1:14:32.110
getting some here a French girl 27th at

1:14:28.960,1:14:35.880
the moment and unlikely to return

1:14:32.110,1:14:35.880
tomorrow with tariffs like that

1:14:40.449,1:14:44.810
yep I think you hit the nail on the head

1:14:42.650,1:14:47.179
there Bob funny very very young the

1:14:44.810,1:14:48.920
second youngest competitor here and it

1:14:47.179,1:14:51.380
takes a while to build these difficult

1:14:48.920,1:14:53.239
dives Hannah Starling from the Team GB

1:14:51.380,1:14:55.520
rocking and rolling with the degree of

1:14:53.239,1:14:57.530
difficulty Fanny here a little bit easy

1:14:55.520,1:14:59.330
on the degree of difficulty entering the

1:14:57.530,1:15:00.890
water looks like she jarred a shoulder a

1:14:59.330,1:15:04.070
little bit there certainly made me wince

1:15:00.890,1:15:05.510
as she went in super slow motion showing

1:15:04.070,1:15:07.190
you that the toe point goes into the

1:15:05.510,1:15:09.820
diving board in order to generate the

1:15:07.190,1:15:14.570
height a little bit short there for the

1:15:09.820,1:15:19.159
French girl fifty point four zero for

1:15:14.570,1:15:24.080
her second youngest competitor followed

1:15:19.159,1:15:25.670
by beneath a snap in there Bob yep

1:15:24.080,1:15:27.380
that's Jennifer she wants to get this

1:15:25.670,1:15:28.640
competition out of the way not having a

1:15:27.380,1:15:30.050
great day in the office today

1:15:28.640,1:15:32.239
reverse two-and-a-half in the Tuck

1:15:30.050,1:15:33.920
position jumping away from the diving

1:15:32.239,1:15:35.480
board squeezing into the touch shape

1:15:33.920,1:15:37.670
seem to be rocking and rolling a bit in

1:15:35.480,1:15:39.860
the air as if she was steering a bus or

1:15:37.670,1:15:42.380
something let's have a look here moving

1:15:39.860,1:15:44.540
side to side not quite sure what's going

1:15:42.380,1:15:48.620
on there it wasn't particularly neat and

1:15:44.540,1:15:50.420
tidy and not having a fantastic three

1:15:48.620,1:15:52.489
meter prelim yeah it's more Rafa Benitez

1:15:50.420,1:15:58.340
really wasn't a thirty-seven point eight

1:15:52.489,1:15:59.929
zero for her and the transfer coming

1:15:58.340,1:16:03.050
back tomorrow getting more remote

1:15:59.929,1:16:05.840
Julianne Veloso in 29th place with her

1:16:03.050,1:16:09.070
reverse two-and-a-half she's plunked it

1:16:05.840,1:16:11.360
on ahead yeah and it didn't look his oh

1:16:09.070,1:16:12.350
it was gonna be that way she landed on

1:16:11.360,1:16:14.210
the end of the diving board with the

1:16:12.350,1:16:16.310
toes over the ends which makes it even

1:16:14.210,1:16:18.530
more difficult but she managed to stay

1:16:16.310,1:16:20.690
with it squeezing into that Pike shape

1:16:18.530,1:16:23.360
holding on pointing her toes up and yep

1:16:20.690,1:16:25.760
she's straight up and down will she make

1:16:23.360,1:16:29.659
it through little way to go she's off

1:16:25.760,1:16:31.540
the pace currently time hotel two more

1:16:29.659,1:16:35.270
guys to go

1:16:31.540,1:16:40.600
fifty-four point zero zero for Giuliano

1:16:35.270,1:16:43.460
Veloso and 22nd at the moment Laura seen

1:16:40.600,1:16:45.920
Sharlene Stratton to open up here comes

1:16:43.460,1:16:48.139
jail Patrick the Australian traversed

1:16:45.920,1:16:49.699
two and a half somersaults with Mike

1:16:48.139,1:16:55.699
and relying in ninth place nice and

1:16:49.699,1:16:57.590
comfy in the middle of the pack oh now

1:16:55.699,1:17:02.329
it's all about the c-word the

1:16:57.590,1:17:03.800
consistency and jl GS faltered slightly

1:17:02.329,1:17:06.709
then we shall leave her a little bit of

1:17:03.800,1:17:08.329
work to do on her final two dives looks

1:17:06.709,1:17:10.239
good so far squeezing into the pike

1:17:08.329,1:17:13.219
shape looking at over a toes just

1:17:10.239,1:17:15.289
hanging on a little bit too long in her

1:17:13.219,1:17:18.280
Pike position let go now

1:17:15.289,1:17:22.459
no now oh there she goes over she goes

1:17:18.280,1:17:24.919
didn't hear you obviously fives will

1:17:22.459,1:17:27.019
count all three fives multiply it by

1:17:24.919,1:17:30.050
three yeah get it now don't ya fifteen

1:17:27.019,1:17:31.969
times three gives you the marks and the

1:17:30.050,1:17:34.729
ones with the lines through they don't

1:17:31.969,1:17:37.869
count that mantra in your head before

1:17:34.729,1:17:41.479
the end of the week nor a barter of

1:17:37.869,1:17:43.909
Hungary with a back two and a half

1:17:41.479,1:17:47.149
somersaults in the top position now she

1:17:43.909,1:17:48.559
is not that far outside qualification

1:17:47.149,1:17:51.949
here and they have been a few falters

1:17:48.559,1:17:54.019
around the 18 to 20 position so she

1:17:51.949,1:17:55.219
could make up some ground on this

1:17:54.019,1:17:57.409
backward two and a half

1:17:55.219,1:17:59.780
we're tuck apart for the fact it's 2.8

1:17:57.409,1:18:00.499
degree of difficulty so pretty much has

1:17:59.780,1:18:03.019
to be spot on

1:18:00.499,1:18:04.969
it does need to be spot on it's very

1:18:03.019,1:18:07.550
very low degree of difficulty throughout

1:18:04.969,1:18:10.070
all five of her dives she is playing

1:18:07.550,1:18:11.449
safe spent many a competition making

1:18:10.070,1:18:13.729
mistakes on the higher degree of

1:18:11.449,1:18:16.579
difficulty getting frustrated that she

1:18:13.729,1:18:18.800
would never make a final or rarely this

1:18:16.579,1:18:20.860
is a game of tactics and at the moment

1:18:18.800,1:18:23.149
it's going okay I think she'll still be

1:18:20.860,1:18:27.229
well there will there abouts in the top

1:18:23.149,1:18:29.209
18 Bob how's she looking 17th nor Abaza

1:18:27.229,1:18:31.039
so she's up there but she will be

1:18:29.209,1:18:32.929
knocked down by Emily hey Mazz I'm short

1:18:31.039,1:18:38.510
but she might just have crept into a

1:18:32.929,1:18:40.729
qualification place there on to Emily

1:18:38.510,1:18:43.760
Haman's not no robotic we just saw her

1:18:40.729,1:18:46.070
and it is a 3.0 degree of difficulty

1:18:43.760,1:18:50.570
reverse two and a half some sorts for

1:18:46.070,1:18:53.570
the Canadian oh what a dive really

1:18:50.570,1:18:56.929
showing a class she has won a medal at

1:18:53.570,1:19:00.320
the previous four Olympic Games

1:18:56.929,1:19:01.480
that is incredible medalist here five

1:19:00.320,1:19:03.960
days ago in the Oh

1:19:01.480,1:19:07.630
winning contest with Jennifer Abel and

1:19:03.960,1:19:10.960
diving like that here we go over 75

1:19:07.630,1:19:14.530
points on this one I'm sure beautiful

1:19:10.960,1:19:16.870
dive from Haman's yeah Canadian diving

1:19:14.530,1:19:19.810
team very close-knit we'll be delighted

1:19:16.870,1:19:21.370
by that coach of course always got

1:19:19.810,1:19:24.430
something to say about how she could do

1:19:21.370,1:19:26.500
it better now the final competitor in

1:19:24.430,1:19:27.970
round number three is flora gone dose of

1:19:26.500,1:19:31.480
Hungary reversed two and a half

1:19:27.970,1:19:33.850
somersaults 2.8 with tongue up straight

1:19:31.480,1:19:36.910
up and down she landed on her head which

1:19:33.850,1:19:38.830
is exactly what she wants to be doing as

1:19:36.910,1:19:40.540
I mentioned previously she's very very

1:19:38.830,1:19:42.160
slight and it's difficult to push a

1:19:40.540,1:19:46.180
springboard I'm and there's not much of

1:19:42.160,1:19:48.280
you this is it's well placed it's low

1:19:46.180,1:19:50.800
degree of difficulty it will get over 50

1:19:48.280,1:19:52.450
points she's must be enjoying her

1:19:50.800,1:19:54.670
Olympic spirit I think she's only 20

1:19:52.450,1:19:57.210
years old and she's got a cool main

1:19:54.670,1:19:59.800
floor a condos all right that name yeah

1:19:57.210,1:20:07.600
can't see you adopting it mind you but

1:19:59.800,1:20:10.440
still end of Round three and so looks

1:20:07.600,1:20:15.190
China 1 & 2 where we've seen that before

1:20:10.440,1:20:17.230
Emily Haman's Canada 3 & 4 Australia

1:20:15.190,1:20:19.810
just changing the routine a bit with the

1:20:17.230,1:20:20.920
fifth place in Italy - USA that they're

1:20:19.810,1:20:24.700
bunching together here aren't they -

1:20:20.920,1:20:26.620
Canadians - Chinese - Americans and a

1:20:24.700,1:20:29.680
portly from a British point of view one

1:20:26.620,1:20:32.200
through one right on the edge & a

1:20:29.680,1:20:34.090
starling close she is he going through

1:20:32.200,1:20:37.090
Noora bars has just stolen her position

1:20:34.090,1:20:39.850
with that dive and anastasiya posniak

1:20:37.090,1:20:43.900
over it's still not quite in the top 18

1:20:39.850,1:20:46.000
as yet these are the ones who will be in

1:20:43.900,1:20:49.200
their own little repechage somewhere

1:20:46.000,1:20:49.200
down Stratford Paul

1:21:04.550,1:21:08.910
penultimate round starts with the

1:21:07.080,1:21:10.800
Australian Charlene Stratton

1:21:08.910,1:21:13.320
looks to have done pretty much all the

1:21:10.800,1:21:15.840
work she needs to have done to get

1:21:13.320,1:21:19.500
through to the last 18 very comfortably

1:21:15.840,1:21:21.390
you see on screen fifth and round three

1:21:19.500,1:21:23.460
starts for her and for everybody with

1:21:21.390,1:21:27.690
the reverse two and a half summer sorts

1:21:23.460,1:21:38.040
with pike in Australian in a decent

1:21:27.690,1:21:42.150
position with her fourth dive she's hot

1:21:38.040,1:21:45.480
to trot yeah the coaches like it again

1:21:42.150,1:21:46.770
for steady dies from Charlene 3.0 to

1:21:45.480,1:21:48.120
reverse two and a half in the pike

1:21:46.770,1:21:50.310
position little bit back from the end of

1:21:48.120,1:21:51.870
the diving board whippy on the start

1:21:50.310,1:21:54.660
there you can see the big arch at the

1:21:51.870,1:21:56.850
beginning she manages to control it okay

1:21:54.660,1:22:00.000
on the finish seven and a half I think

1:21:56.850,1:22:03.360
coming her way and again it's a long old

1:22:00.000,1:22:10.590
competition sixty seven point five zero

1:22:03.360,1:22:11.880
that's fine not great but it'll do now

1:22:10.590,1:22:14.880
on to the Chairman

1:22:11.880,1:22:19.230
we'll see here yeah close-up on the

1:22:14.880,1:22:22.560
catcher dick off verse two and a half

1:22:19.230,1:22:26.270
somersaults in the plank position and

1:22:22.560,1:22:31.530
she is flirting with not qualifying in

1:22:26.270,1:22:33.480
17th place after round three oh well

1:22:31.530,1:22:35.850
she's flirting with qualifying now

1:22:33.480,1:22:38.910
that's the best I've so far round number

1:22:35.850,1:22:42.540
four reverse two and a half in the pike

1:22:38.910,1:22:44.670
position 3.0 it's a big dive and it's

1:22:42.540,1:22:45.330
where it needs to be to put a back in

1:22:44.670,1:22:47.610
contention

1:22:45.330,1:22:49.410
I think she's 17th currently or after

1:22:47.610,1:22:51.720
the round round three that'll put the

1:22:49.410,1:22:53.550
pressure on a lot of the other divers in

1:22:51.720,1:22:55.590
that kind of middle ground middle of the

1:22:53.550,1:22:58.320
pack got to be in the top 18 to make the

1:22:55.590,1:23:00.750
cut cut your dick off

1:22:58.320,1:23:04.110
yeah like that because smile on her face

1:23:00.750,1:23:07.140
happy with it and she might be 7th and 7

1:23:04.110,1:23:12.110
points a she all sevens on there let's

1:23:07.140,1:23:15.330
give her the mark she needs of 63 all

1:23:12.110,1:23:17.970
her chances of returning in the

1:23:15.330,1:23:19.620
semi-finals have a starry however didn't

1:23:17.970,1:23:21.120
really want to see that because that's

1:23:19.620,1:23:23.610
one of the places she was looking for

1:23:21.120,1:23:27.240
she can do a lot of good for herself

1:23:23.610,1:23:28.760
with a decent or excellent backwards two

1:23:27.240,1:23:34.950
and a half summer sauce with pike

1:23:28.760,1:23:40.230
well that's good it is good 17 holding

1:23:34.950,1:23:42.510
her own halted on the last dive she's

1:23:40.230,1:23:45.540
gonna get those claws right now and claw

1:23:42.510,1:23:47.070
her way back that's very good straight

1:23:45.540,1:23:49.500
up and down little bit of a tip over

1:23:47.070,1:23:52.560
it'll get seven and a half so those

1:23:49.500,1:23:54.450
should get over over 65 points and that

1:23:52.560,1:23:56.520
will bring it back up in the mix well

1:23:54.450,1:23:58.620
done good little battle for that final

1:23:56.520,1:24:03.890
qualification place going on and Hannah

1:23:58.620,1:24:10.310
is part of that battle with sixty 7.50

1:24:03.890,1:24:10.310
Marion 48 he's not returning she's 29th

1:24:10.670,1:24:18.300
well it's one of her better dives for

1:24:14.400,1:24:21.720
two and a half for one twist lots lots

1:24:18.300,1:24:23.370
going on generate enough height from

1:24:21.720,1:24:25.290
that diving body in order to complete

1:24:23.370,1:24:27.660
all these spins and rotations here we go

1:24:25.290,1:24:30.150
folding into the pike up i1 twist back

1:24:27.660,1:24:32.210
into the pike squeezing in it straight

1:24:30.150,1:24:36.300
up and down six and a half so I guess

1:24:32.210,1:24:38.130
but too much work to do for the one

1:24:36.300,1:24:40.400
first of two French divers yeah

1:24:38.130,1:24:46.830
the early tariff dive didn't really help

1:24:40.400,1:24:49.500
accumulation 58.50 on that dive has been

1:24:46.830,1:24:51.180
in her previous to though Francesca

1:24:49.500,1:24:53.190
Donna paid just stepped outside the top

1:24:51.180,1:24:54.960
ten after a third round dive

1:24:53.190,1:24:56.850
it's not to repair the damage with a

1:24:54.960,1:25:00.030
reverse two and a half somersault with

1:24:56.850,1:25:01.710
Pike 3.0 through the degree of

1:25:00.030,1:25:04.860
difficulty on this one

1:25:01.710,1:25:07.380
well she does okay in fact she'll get

1:25:04.860,1:25:09.450
away with that I didn't really like the

1:25:07.380,1:25:11.700
take off I might go too deep into there

1:25:09.450,1:25:13.500
to the technical it but she she kind of

1:25:11.700,1:25:15.840
collapsed through her knees and skipped

1:25:13.500,1:25:17.430
off the end of the diving board there we

1:25:15.840,1:25:19.920
go see the knees were bent there the

1:25:17.430,1:25:22.200
churches should penalize for that but

1:25:19.920,1:25:23.580
she managed to fix it up okay on the

1:25:22.200,1:25:24.960
finish to give the impression the dive

1:25:23.580,1:25:26.910
was actually better than it is I

1:25:24.960,1:25:32.520
shouldn't think that you see more than

1:25:26.910,1:25:36.950
six six and a half bottle been doing the

1:25:32.520,1:25:41.400
runes again 6.54 down a peg

1:25:36.950,1:25:43.890
anastasiya posniak over 20th place will

1:25:41.400,1:25:45.540
not get it done for the semi-final so

1:25:43.890,1:25:47.730
she has to find something out this

1:25:45.540,1:25:51.120
reverse two-and-a-half somersaults Pike

1:25:47.730,1:25:54.000
3.0 well that's much more like it

1:25:51.120,1:25:55.740
Olympic medalist next to you Leah pack

1:25:54.000,1:25:58.800
Alena in the synchro springboard so she

1:25:55.740,1:26:01.050
knows what it's like to stand up in this

1:25:58.800,1:26:02.580
kind of an occasion that is much more

1:26:01.050,1:26:04.650
like it she does need to get the

1:26:02.580,1:26:07.470
comeback going on and that will help her

1:26:04.650,1:26:09.690
this dive will add to the previous three

1:26:07.470,1:26:13.320
one more dive to go from Nastya

1:26:09.690,1:26:16.170
Anastasia nasty it's a nickname in case

1:26:13.320,1:26:17.940
you're wondering I was in verse two and

1:26:16.170,1:26:21.360
a half in the pike position yeah it's

1:26:17.940,1:26:24.300
good let's see less from legal people

1:26:21.360,1:26:28.320
arriving you said that 7.54 posniak

1:26:24.300,1:26:28.800
Evert and will help her cause quite some

1:26:28.320,1:26:33.090
way

1:26:28.800,1:26:35.490
Norah schinsky 15th after round three

1:26:33.090,1:26:38.270
and here comes her reverse to announce I

1:26:35.490,1:26:41.730
was up with Mike oh that's the best dive

1:26:38.270,1:26:44.220
she's been relatively solid you know not

1:26:41.730,1:26:47.190
really lighting this place on fire but

1:26:44.220,1:26:50.040
landing upright each and every dive

1:26:47.190,1:26:52.260
consistent they'll get over 65 points

1:26:50.040,1:26:54.720
and that's exactly what she needs to

1:26:52.260,1:26:57.390
keep her slowly moving up the pack I

1:26:54.720,1:27:00.740
think Bob hey won't do her any harm will

1:26:57.390,1:27:03.420
it sixty seven point five zero the mark

1:27:00.740,1:27:05.580
which we got confirmed on screen just

1:27:03.420,1:27:07.350
give me a teaser I shoulda told you

1:27:05.580,1:27:08.700
before you see on speed but here it

1:27:07.350,1:27:12.670
comes

1:27:08.700,1:27:16.210
three sevens at some point fives right

1:27:12.670,1:27:20.320
across the board and at sixty seven

1:27:16.210,1:27:23.320
point five zero for schinsky Jennifer

1:27:20.320,1:27:27.460
Abel so place the world's fourth place

1:27:23.320,1:27:30.700
of the Olympics of the moment that is

1:27:27.460,1:27:32.620
good I can hear the coaches in my ears

1:27:30.700,1:27:34.650
I'm sure you can hear that home shouting

1:27:32.620,1:27:37.870
and screaming trying to influence the

1:27:34.650,1:27:40.060
the judges need to influence them too

1:27:37.870,1:27:42.190
heavily though that's well that's a

1:27:40.060,1:27:44.770
little bit low on the water actually not

1:27:42.190,1:27:46.630
as strong as I've seen Jennifer perform

1:27:44.770,1:27:49.960
this particular dive in the past

1:27:46.630,1:27:52.530
Shammi just in the water there explain

1:27:49.960,1:27:55.720
what they do in a bit but yeah 63 points

1:27:52.530,1:27:58.390
seven seven and seven before Jennifer

1:27:55.720,1:28:01.210
able and she did all the hard work early

1:27:58.390,1:28:04.750
on and limburger's just moved back into

1:28:01.210,1:28:05.730
the top ten so is it a lot margin for

1:28:04.750,1:28:07.870
error here

1:28:05.730,1:28:12.510
inward two and a half some sorts with

1:28:07.870,1:28:12.510
Pike 3.0 for the Swede

1:28:18.300,1:28:24.730
it's tidy it's sometimes the one that

1:28:21.220,1:28:27.460
lets a dime she's had many an injury and

1:28:24.730,1:28:30.220
a bank or in her diving career actually

1:28:27.460,1:28:32.100
she is that what she take listed a as in

1:28:30.220,1:28:34.720
there's no tape on her ankle

1:28:32.100,1:28:37.570
obviously you recovered from those in

1:28:34.720,1:28:39.880
injuries in the past and this dive is

1:28:37.570,1:28:42.100
certainly a little bit easier than I've

1:28:39.880,1:28:44.530
seen it for her in the past

1:28:42.100,1:28:48.340
well done Anna what Marx does it bring

1:28:44.530,1:28:50.740
it brings another set of 7s judges are

1:28:48.340,1:28:55.180
being consistent and so now is she with

1:28:50.740,1:28:59.880
a 63 second Olympics for Christina Lucas

1:28:55.180,1:29:01.960
of America seventh after round three and

1:28:59.880,1:29:03.610
it's three point one degree of

1:29:01.960,1:29:07.660
difficulty on a forward three and a half

1:29:03.610,1:29:11.380
summer sorts with pike what she was

1:29:07.660,1:29:14.110
cruising made a little bit of a mistake

1:29:11.380,1:29:15.820
on the entry into the water she done all

1:29:14.110,1:29:17.770
the hard work the aerial work is good

1:29:15.820,1:29:20.200
here she goes up up and away this is

1:29:17.770,1:29:22.780
tough it's three point one squeezing in

1:29:20.200,1:29:24.490
just lowering the dive to roll over a

1:29:22.780,1:29:26.500
vertical in fact she's probably a little

1:29:24.490,1:29:29.020
bit low on the water which can

1:29:26.500,1:29:31.330
contribute in that way didn't quite have

1:29:29.020,1:29:35.590
the the confidence she needed at the

1:29:31.330,1:29:37.840
bottom six and a half stack I'm sixty

1:29:35.590,1:29:42.790
point four five is the total score for

1:29:37.840,1:29:46.050
Lucas now Laura Sanchez saw top the

1:29:42.790,1:29:49.690
Mexican in 13th place after round three

1:29:46.050,1:29:52.300
three point one's for you oh that's very

1:29:49.690,1:29:55.750
good she she has a little bit of a

1:29:52.300,1:29:57.820
challenge on some of her takeoffs I'm

1:29:55.750,1:29:59.590
gonna say she looks a little skew if

1:29:57.820,1:30:01.600
again there we are pointing slightly

1:29:59.590,1:30:03.880
towards the judges spinning towards us

1:30:01.600,1:30:05.470
here at home or you at home me here in

1:30:03.880,1:30:06.820
the commentary box we need to kind of

1:30:05.470,1:30:08.290
push her back that way then we can see

1:30:06.820,1:30:10.240
it potentially for the yang landing in

1:30:08.290,1:30:12.520
the corner of the diving board spinning

1:30:10.240,1:30:13.870
towards us there now there isn't correct

1:30:12.520,1:30:16.830
you should be in line with the diving

1:30:13.870,1:30:19.620
board Mexican coach there

1:30:16.830,1:30:21.930
okay the judges didn't see it no we did

1:30:19.620,1:30:23.430
but you didn't judges so that's why

1:30:21.930,1:30:27.960
should be marked up slightly on that

1:30:23.430,1:30:31.440
sixty six point six five last but one

1:30:27.960,1:30:34.680
dive in this competition for egg our

1:30:31.440,1:30:37.080
malaysia she won't be returning reverse

1:30:34.680,1:30:40.800
two and half somersaults with Mike three

1:30:37.080,1:30:43.140
point zero degree of difficulty oh that

1:30:40.800,1:30:44.490
feels like a little bit of a bat around

1:30:43.140,1:30:48.030
the back of the head

1:30:44.490,1:30:49.800
short of vertical not quite looking back

1:30:48.030,1:30:52.380
far enough in order to bring the dive

1:30:49.800,1:30:53.730
vine to the vertical position here we go

1:30:52.380,1:30:55.890
you can't see where you go and you can

1:30:53.730,1:30:56.850
only see where you've been and it

1:30:55.890,1:30:59.370
doesn't quite make it

1:30:56.850,1:31:02.910
Oh little bit doesn't hurt quite as much

1:30:59.370,1:31:06.150
as it does from the 10-meter yeah being

1:31:02.910,1:31:08.010
thrown here there and everywhere no I

1:31:06.150,1:31:09.780
think the coaches in yellow from

1:31:08.010,1:31:11.910
Malaysia they're saying all Bob that was

1:31:09.780,1:31:13.650
the equivalent of an emergency stop at a

1:31:11.910,1:31:17.390
car wasn't it just coming to a grinding

1:31:13.650,1:31:20.880
halt there not been a great day for egg

1:31:17.390,1:31:24.750
it's been a okay date for ten year

1:31:20.880,1:31:26.670
Kenyatta so far see what she can keep it

1:31:24.750,1:31:30.900
going with inward two and a half

1:31:26.670,1:31:33.270
somersaults in the pipe position back up

1:31:30.900,1:31:37.470
there to the 3.0 degree of difficulty on

1:31:33.270,1:31:42.990
this one Oh beautiful dive from Tanya

1:31:37.470,1:31:44.970
Kenyatta yep she's certainly gonna give

1:31:42.990,1:31:46.800
it a wall this will be her chance her

1:31:44.970,1:31:48.600
final chance actually in two days time

1:31:46.800,1:31:50.310
provided she makes it through to

1:31:48.600,1:31:53.540
challenge her a medal to emulate her

1:31:50.310,1:31:55.920
father the great diver Giorgio Kenyatta

1:31:53.540,1:31:58.080
this year's inward two and a half in the

1:31:55.920,1:31:58.440
pike position delicious entry into the

1:31:58.080,1:32:01.160
water

1:31:58.440,1:32:01.160
YUM

1:32:03.590,1:32:09.210
75 for sadly again sure how you respond

1:32:07.560,1:32:15.120
to that so I won't I just say that was

1:32:09.210,1:32:17.250
pretty good now chong of malaysia where

1:32:15.120,1:32:20.370
the back two and a half somersaults with

1:32:17.250,1:32:24.650
pike 27th after round three highly

1:32:20.370,1:32:24.650
unlikely we'll see much more of her oh

1:32:27.290,1:32:33.030
it's neat and tidy and it's not going to

1:32:30.780,1:32:35.520
help her campaign this morning twenty

1:32:33.030,1:32:37.590
seventh after third round that may move

1:32:35.520,1:32:42.450
up slightly it's neat and tidy it'll get

1:32:37.590,1:32:44.400
sevens a little bit short of vertical so

1:32:42.450,1:32:46.350
that's pretty good if she did Ferb he

1:32:44.400,1:32:48.180
performs her first three with that kind

1:32:46.350,1:32:51.060
of execution she'd have been a little

1:32:48.180,1:32:54.150
bit more in the mix one more dive to

1:32:51.060,1:32:56.550
come for her or she can think about the

1:32:54.150,1:33:00.240
journey home or enjoying yourself in the

1:32:56.550,1:33:02.100
athletes village this 15th place is

1:33:00.240,1:33:04.380
gonna go hurtling down as the

1:33:02.100,1:33:08.100
competition goes on Casti Krug into a

1:33:04.380,1:33:09.660
reverse two and a half very quickly yes

1:33:08.100,1:33:11.760
she came hurtling into the end of the

1:33:09.660,1:33:13.650
diving board there generating quite a

1:33:11.760,1:33:15.270
lot of forward momentum and that can be

1:33:13.650,1:33:17.820
a little bit risky because union Nita

1:33:15.270,1:33:19.200
put the brakes on and then you know let

1:33:17.820,1:33:21.180
the hips move forward as you spin

1:33:19.200,1:33:24.030
backwards on the reverse a little bit

1:33:21.180,1:33:27.990
scruffy there both feet flat legs coming

1:33:24.030,1:33:29.850
apart so it's only gonna get sixes over

1:33:27.990,1:33:32.370
a vertical yeah actually started off

1:33:29.850,1:33:34.740
strongly no the second American diver

1:33:32.370,1:33:38.420
we've seen is gonna be moving down the

1:33:34.740,1:33:41.550
pack slightly with 51 points not good

1:33:38.420,1:33:43.590
currently in eighth position but again

1:33:41.550,1:33:45.510
she won't be there for very long so

1:33:43.590,1:33:48.120
you'll probably find herself in the

1:33:45.510,1:33:55.830
bottom half of the qualifiers very soon

1:33:48.120,1:33:59.000
now desktop buzina of russia reverse two

1:33:55.830,1:33:59.000
and a half so again

1:33:59.420,1:34:06.090
well that's more like it

1:34:01.380,1:34:07.740
there we go contrast to cassidy you can

1:34:06.090,1:34:11.070
see the elegance of this russian diver

1:34:07.740,1:34:13.620
on this particular dive very neat very

1:34:11.070,1:34:14.770
tidy the judges are looking to be

1:34:13.620,1:34:16.150
impressed

1:34:14.770,1:34:17.770
the beautiful nature of the dive

1:34:16.150,1:34:20.200
aesthetically pleasing look at that

1:34:17.770,1:34:21.640
beautiful Pike shaped great line little

1:34:20.200,1:34:25.450
bit over vertical as she went in that

1:34:21.640,1:34:30.430
will get 7.5 s yeah which is much more

1:34:25.450,1:34:32.950
like it conformation sixty seven point

1:34:30.430,1:34:34.390
five zero seven point five those ones

1:34:32.950,1:34:38.400
were counting the ones on the right-hand

1:34:34.390,1:34:38.400
side of the screen are struck off

1:34:38.580,1:34:43.120
working with a hyperactive child here

1:34:40.780,1:34:47.620
comes another one the ranches Chavez

1:34:43.120,1:34:49.720
muñoz well it's pretty good see she's

1:34:47.620,1:34:53.590
left herself way too much to do after

1:34:49.720,1:34:55.210
the the first round I've ended up in the

1:34:53.590,1:34:56.800
middle of the pool this one he's

1:34:55.210,1:34:59.350
actually good straight up and down

1:34:56.800,1:35:02.350
showing her courage and determination

1:34:59.350,1:35:05.320
and professionalism by continuing to put

1:35:02.350,1:35:07.420
every single bit of effort into her next

1:35:05.320,1:35:08.860
round I followed by the next one it's

1:35:07.420,1:35:10.420
good it's three point one it's tough

1:35:08.860,1:35:12.580
father to see this Mexican girl in

1:35:10.420,1:35:14.830
another day but she won't be progressing

1:35:12.580,1:35:16.600
today too much to do yeah 22nd at the

1:35:14.830,1:35:20.410
moment but that will change with the

1:35:16.600,1:35:23.680
remaining divers to come let's diver

1:35:20.410,1:35:25.990
however he was looking forward to she

1:35:23.680,1:35:28.120
would be I'm sure back tomorrow hers eat

1:35:25.990,1:35:33.850
first two and a half summer sorts with

1:35:28.120,1:35:36.940
Pike 3.0 oh wow here comes her Z like a

1:35:33.850,1:35:38.950
steam train seat very well they're

1:35:36.940,1:35:41.800
hanging ten feet over the end of the

1:35:38.950,1:35:43.720
diving boards staying calm staying

1:35:41.800,1:35:46.420
composed keeping the pilots look at that

1:35:43.720,1:35:47.380
almost skipped off there but she knows

1:35:46.420,1:35:49.450
what she's doing

1:35:47.380,1:35:52.420
kinesthetic feedback knowing where you

1:35:49.450,1:35:55.410
are when you're moving all working for

1:35:52.420,1:35:58.540
upside down there we go into the water

1:35:55.410,1:36:01.000
pretty good that will be good enough for

1:35:58.540,1:36:08.110
first place before the time being over

1:36:01.000,1:36:12.090
300 goes her seat now on to Elena who's

1:36:08.110,1:36:14.530
been involved in diving straight away

1:36:12.090,1:36:17.950
yet trying to rattle off these dives as

1:36:14.530,1:36:19.330
quick as she can getting through but

1:36:17.950,1:36:21.130
that's actually another good my own

1:36:19.330,1:36:23.530
effort she left herself a little bit to

1:36:21.130,1:36:26.340
do first two round dives not so hot

1:36:23.530,1:36:28.619
three and four much more like it

1:36:26.340,1:36:32.659
squeezing into the Pike shape

1:36:28.619,1:36:35.399
yes sneak it in there that'll get 65 ish

1:36:32.659,1:36:36.899
nice and she is moving out the pecking

1:36:35.399,1:36:39.090
order you see on the left your screen in

1:36:36.899,1:36:46.829
red she's up to 12 play snarling a fella

1:36:39.090,1:36:51.929
over that score of 66 such a beautiful

1:36:46.829,1:36:56.729
diving pool joseline Castillo Suarez yes

1:36:51.929,1:36:59.340
she's in the distance there she is

1:36:56.729,1:37:02.909
close-up where the back of two and a

1:36:59.340,1:37:16.010
half summer sorts with Pike 3.0 degree

1:37:02.909,1:37:22.139
of difficulty no it's pretty ordinary

1:37:16.010,1:37:24.119
and you took a time shaking his head a

1:37:22.139,1:37:26.939
little bit left yourself quite a lot to

1:37:24.119,1:37:29.189
do 22nd it's only gonna get fives on

1:37:26.939,1:37:31.110
this short of vertical letting go a

1:37:29.189,1:37:35.939
little bit of an arch splitting the feet

1:37:31.110,1:37:39.689
yeah lots of little errors there making

1:37:35.939,1:37:42.090
it an average dive and that's exactly

1:37:39.689,1:37:46.199
what's reflected in the marks from the

1:37:42.090,1:37:48.800
judges five five and five as the ones

1:37:46.199,1:37:52.219
that will count towards her total score

1:37:48.800,1:37:56.820
the second of the chinese wu ming shep

1:37:52.219,1:37:58.760
second place after round 4

1:37:56.820,1:38:01.320
she comes with her reverse

1:37:58.760,1:38:05.639
two-and-a-half somersaults in the pike

1:38:01.320,1:38:07.619
position Wow wowee I was expecting that

1:38:05.639,1:38:09.149
to be good you have a little bit of

1:38:07.619,1:38:10.559
trouble with their takeoffs or landing

1:38:09.149,1:38:12.389
on the end of the diving board but no

1:38:10.559,1:38:14.129
mistakes there for five dive reverse

1:38:12.389,1:38:17.719
two-and-a-half in the pike position from

1:38:14.129,1:38:21.689
Wu they still get nines

1:38:17.719,1:38:25.429
beautiful exit from the dive gliding in

1:38:21.689,1:38:27.899
splash this entry here we go

1:38:25.429,1:38:30.780
effortless you can't even see the strain

1:38:27.899,1:38:33.770
on her face squeezed against that

1:38:30.780,1:38:36.560
beautiful Pike shape drilling her entry

1:38:33.770,1:38:38.270
let's go whoo we haven't had any tens of

1:38:36.560,1:38:41.150
the counted yet with only tens on the

1:38:38.270,1:38:41.750
scoreboard they're quite three lines for

1:38:41.150,1:38:45.020
whoo

1:38:41.750,1:38:47.030
who goes into first place yeah Rebecca

1:38:45.020,1:38:50.180
Gallen treat there's two more round to

1:38:47.030,1:38:52.940
go and the way things are standing she's

1:38:50.180,1:38:55.520
standing in position to go forward to

1:38:52.940,1:38:58.040
the last 18 inward two and a half

1:38:55.520,1:39:03.290
somersaults with Pike 3.0 for the second

1:38:58.040,1:39:05.660
Brit running out of room well the

1:39:03.290,1:39:07.280
take-off looked okay to me but then I

1:39:05.660,1:39:09.290
think she just needs to be a bit more

1:39:07.280,1:39:11.030
confident that she exits the dive here

1:39:09.290,1:39:12.469
we go squeezing into the pike spinning

1:39:11.030,1:39:15.800
forwards towards the diving board and

1:39:12.469,1:39:17.510
she a co-op she needed a bit more height

1:39:15.800,1:39:18.920
in a bit more rotation on that but she

1:39:17.510,1:39:20.570
could have still attacked the finish a

1:39:18.920,1:39:23.090
little bit more can't really see from

1:39:20.570,1:39:25.520
under the water there but yeah that's

1:39:23.090,1:39:28.340
not good and maybe she can hang on in

1:39:25.520,1:39:30.140
there died to 15th Joe might have a bit

1:39:28.340,1:39:32.360
of an agonizing way to find out whether

1:39:30.140,1:39:35.900
she's made it that's a brave smile I

1:39:32.360,1:39:40.160
mean I confident smile at this stage and

1:39:35.900,1:39:44.870
I his men scoop of Ukraine 23rd after

1:39:40.160,1:39:48.860
round three yes her in we're two and a

1:39:44.870,1:39:51.469
half little bit better than Rebekah

1:39:48.860,1:39:53.660
gallantry from Team GP just before her

1:39:51.469,1:39:56.719
same dive inward standing backwards on

1:39:53.660,1:39:58.700
the diving board the trick is here is to

1:39:56.719,1:40:02.060
be far enough away from the diving board

1:39:58.700,1:40:03.469
so you don't touch it and when your legs

1:40:02.060,1:40:04.280
are straight as the girls are here in

1:40:03.469,1:40:05.840
the pike position

1:40:04.280,1:40:07.610
you can't come a little bit close to the

1:40:05.840,1:40:10.190
diving board but she was a safe distance

1:40:07.610,1:40:11.780
but that does compromise the height you

1:40:10.190,1:40:14.120
get sometimes in fact to be safe she's

1:40:11.780,1:40:16.880
moving right to the side look at that

1:40:14.120,1:40:20.570
almost landing on her side as she went

1:40:16.880,1:40:22.880
in yeah that's not gonna be all that

1:40:20.570,1:40:25.790
advantageous for a 20th place finally

1:40:22.880,1:40:29.330
Bouvet now still in the twos 2.8 for the

1:40:25.790,1:40:33.620
reverse two and a half oh that's one of

1:40:29.330,1:40:39.230
a special efforts this morning 2.8

1:40:33.620,1:40:41.630
degree of difficulty squeezing into the

1:40:39.230,1:40:43.969
touch shape making sure she completes

1:40:41.630,1:40:46.580
the rotations before pointing her toes

1:40:43.969,1:40:47.700
up towards the ceiling yeah six six and

1:40:46.580,1:40:50.880
a half I think for that

1:40:47.700,1:40:54.090
one still I'm sure we see this young

1:40:50.880,1:40:58.020
girl featuring 18 years old there we are

1:40:54.090,1:40:59.460
well she's up to 21st a few more divers

1:40:58.020,1:41:01.380
to go in this round yet so that's a bit

1:40:59.460,1:41:03.930
of progress for her from 25th where she

1:41:01.380,1:41:06.810
was yes

1:41:03.930,1:41:08.760
Jennifer Benitez our Spain and the

1:41:06.810,1:41:11.670
wretched last round I'm sushi correct

1:41:08.760,1:41:13.620
things forward two and a half yeah it's

1:41:11.670,1:41:16.110
good it's reasonable it's well executed

1:41:13.620,1:41:21.180
but it's low degree of difficulty two

1:41:16.110,1:41:23.670
point four here we go back from the end

1:41:21.180,1:41:25.110
of the diving board squeezing into the

1:41:23.670,1:41:27.270
pike shape she knows where she is

1:41:25.110,1:41:32.460
looking at the water there before she

1:41:27.270,1:41:34.410
lines up for it 60s I think but

1:41:32.460,1:41:36.240
certainly won't be moving forward into

1:41:34.410,1:41:38.520
the semi-finals I don't think obviously

1:41:36.240,1:41:41.370
one more round of dives to go after this

1:41:38.520,1:41:44.460
one yeah 30 will be cold

1:41:41.370,1:41:50.760
- 18 and 18 when we called - 12 for the

1:41:44.460,1:41:55.470
final where they after onto Giuliano

1:41:50.760,1:41:57.990
Veloso Brazil another one who will not

1:41:55.470,1:42:00.090
be in the last 18 which is there

1:41:57.990,1:42:03.500
something really incredible in with two

1:42:00.090,1:42:03.500
and a half with pike

1:42:10.260,1:42:15.280
look here the strain is as she took off

1:42:13.510,1:42:18.130
their grunting a little bit like a

1:42:15.280,1:42:20.340
tennis player on a return just showing

1:42:18.130,1:42:22.600
you how much effort needs to go in and

1:42:20.340,1:42:26.280
the grunting worked because that's

1:42:22.600,1:42:28.540
actually one of her better dives still

1:42:26.280,1:42:32.410
not sure where she's going to be after

1:42:28.540,1:42:34.090
this round I excited the top 18 it shows

1:42:32.410,1:42:36.670
you how much effort these divers are

1:42:34.090,1:42:38.380
putting in a three and a half meter

1:42:36.670,1:42:39.690
springboard would have been a benefit

1:42:38.380,1:42:44.650
there when that one though

1:42:39.690,1:42:48.880
six is and or six singular as 6.5 toward

1:42:44.650,1:42:53.170
her total as we move on to the second of

1:42:48.880,1:42:55.060
the Australians jail Patrick only 14 so

1:42:53.170,1:42:58.630
no margin for error on this for three

1:42:55.060,1:43:01.660
and a half three point one oh you gave

1:42:58.630,1:43:04.270
me the commentators curse there Bob no

1:43:01.660,1:43:06.310
Marty forever and that was nearly a big

1:43:04.270,1:43:08.260
error yeah

1:43:06.310,1:43:10.210
JL started off strongly you can see

1:43:08.260,1:43:14.530
their toes over the end leaning forwards

1:43:10.210,1:43:16.300
way too far just up I hides it on the

1:43:14.530,1:43:18.370
finish that's only gonna get five so I

1:43:16.300,1:43:20.770
think squeezing in I bet she's going oh

1:43:18.370,1:43:22.720
no oh no oh no as she comes around here

1:43:20.770,1:43:25.930
and I certainly was anyway jail probably

1:43:22.720,1:43:28.480
much more composed than I frustrating

1:43:25.930,1:43:30.700
but has she done enough oh she's a big

1:43:28.480,1:43:36.210
John Lennon fan that's a fifty one point

1:43:30.700,1:43:39.490
one five for jail Patrick Nora barter

1:43:36.210,1:43:41.860
18th place last of the qualification

1:43:39.490,1:43:44.800
places for her butts very type two in

1:43:41.860,1:43:47.020
about sixteen and twenty one here so

1:43:44.800,1:43:50.050
this is it needs to be good again she's

1:43:47.020,1:43:51.520
come for a very low tariff dive try and

1:43:50.050,1:43:53.980
submit that place it reversed

1:43:51.520,1:43:56.820
two-and-a-half somersaults with tuck for

1:43:53.980,1:43:56.820
the Hungarian

1:43:57.209,1:44:03.719
Oh game of tactics unfolding going for

1:44:02.249,1:44:05.369
Lolo to CRIF difficult it in the

1:44:03.719,1:44:09.420
expression on the coach's face s says it

1:44:05.369,1:44:10.979
all now nor playing safe universe

1:44:09.420,1:44:13.289
two-and-a-half actually kills the

1:44:10.979,1:44:14.939
rotation a little bit there by bringing

1:44:13.289,1:44:16.709
your knees up off the diving board a

1:44:14.939,1:44:19.499
little bit quicker than she needed to -

1:44:16.709,1:44:21.869
yeah - almost stopped herself rotating

1:44:19.499,1:44:25.559
so quickly and didn't need to do that

1:44:21.869,1:44:26.610
and sure - vertical oh my good look at

1:44:25.559,1:44:30.030
the damage has been done to that

1:44:26.610,1:44:31.499
eighteenth down to 24 for Nora barter

1:44:30.030,1:44:36.209
she was looking at the semi-final place

1:44:31.499,1:44:41.459
now maybe she is not after that emily

1:44:36.209,1:44:43.889
Haman's however a lot of divers behind

1:44:41.459,1:44:45.959
her so progression should be a formality

1:44:43.889,1:44:49.920
now with her for two and a half with one

1:44:45.959,1:44:52.619
twist oh you say formality it's a little

1:44:49.920,1:44:53.999
bit of faltering there from Haman's I've

1:44:52.619,1:44:55.889
been mentioning throughout a program

1:44:53.999,1:44:57.150
she's got long legs in relation to her

1:44:55.889,1:44:58.679
body that means anything in the pike

1:44:57.150,1:45:00.630
position is tough here we go just

1:44:58.679,1:45:02.039
showing you how tough it is there she is

1:45:00.630,1:45:03.929
one and a half somersaults into the

1:45:02.039,1:45:05.489
twist just running out of room Emily

1:45:03.929,1:45:06.989
would have benefited from the three and

1:45:05.489,1:45:09.809
a half metre springboard not that there

1:45:06.989,1:45:11.459
is such a thing she are squeezing and

1:45:09.809,1:45:15.630
I've seen her do that so much better

1:45:11.459,1:45:18.689
that will get less than 60 points 58.50

1:45:15.630,1:45:21.110
to be precise 6.5 s will count towards

1:45:18.689,1:45:26.010
the total that's how we arrived at that

1:45:21.110,1:45:28.920
58.5 and last up it is the other

1:45:26.010,1:45:31.079
hungarian flora gone dos she has a

1:45:28.920,1:45:33.539
chance you know I'm moving into a top 18

1:45:31.079,1:45:36.420
place 21st at the moment after round

1:45:33.539,1:45:40.889
three get this one right you never know

1:45:36.420,1:45:44.969
oh let's go GaN DOS I hope she does make

1:45:40.889,1:45:46.679
it through loving a name Wow you know

1:45:44.969,1:45:48.900
it's tough out there she's only 20 years

1:45:46.679,1:45:50.369
old and it's a springboard and I don't

1:45:48.900,1:45:52.110
suppose she weighs very much is he's

1:45:50.369,1:45:54.059
having to push this thing down see the

1:45:52.110,1:45:55.619
wheel there just left of the shot the

1:45:54.059,1:45:57.239
further back you moved that the more

1:45:55.619,1:45:58.679
flexibility in the diving board it's

1:45:57.239,1:46:00.630
obviously divers preference where they

1:45:58.679,1:46:03.650
have that that's it give us a wave floor

1:46:00.630,1:46:05.910
I keep on chipping away you know 20th

1:46:03.650,1:46:08.520
moved up now

1:46:05.910,1:46:10.830
question is who is where and who is

1:46:08.520,1:46:12.660
gonna be returning for the semi-finals

1:46:10.830,1:46:14.070
we don't of course know that yet we have

1:46:12.660,1:46:16.140
one more round to go but who's put

1:46:14.070,1:46:19.200
themselves in position front page all

1:46:16.140,1:46:21.540
these should be safe I say drop a dive

1:46:19.200,1:46:25.200
China China it's the Australia Canada

1:46:21.540,1:46:27.720
Canada and top ten pretty much you'd

1:46:25.200,1:46:30.270
predict there's any big names who are

1:46:27.720,1:46:32.880
struggling a little bit on page number

1:46:30.270,1:46:34.410
two because all the big names and the

1:46:32.880,1:46:37.790
big nations are they yeah dalla pays on

1:46:34.410,1:46:40.680
page tears Cassie Krug the two Brits who

1:46:37.790,1:46:43.020
sixteen and seventeen there really is no

1:46:40.680,1:46:45.600
margin for error there and jail patrick

1:46:43.020,1:46:47.340
has the last position Bosnia cover is

1:46:45.600,1:46:48.720
not quite there actually gone just got a

1:46:47.340,1:46:50.400
lot of ground to make up to get the top

1:46:48.720,1:46:51.510
eighteen she got twenty points to make

1:46:50.400,1:46:54.720
up and she's not going to do that I

1:46:51.510,1:46:57.230
don't think young was meant to go Bouvet

1:46:54.720,1:47:00.810
for though so or thinking about

1:46:57.230,1:47:04.109
Westfield tomorrow and some shopping

1:47:00.810,1:47:04.109
[Music]

1:47:05.280,1:47:10.590
last round they grow up from a great

1:47:08.430,1:47:12.510
crowd they have been so noisy in here

1:47:10.590,1:47:14.460
and very supportive very appreciative

1:47:12.510,1:47:19.590
all the divers particularly those of the

1:47:14.460,1:47:22.110
home nation and good succession of dyes

1:47:19.590,1:47:26.850
from Charlene Stratton today not really

1:47:22.110,1:47:29.610
ever been in trouble 72 67 68 and 67 the

1:47:26.850,1:47:32.970
marks the first four rounds as she

1:47:29.610,1:47:35.580
finish it all off in style and get ready

1:47:32.970,1:47:36.780
and prepared for the last a team she's

1:47:35.580,1:47:40.080
going with an inward two and a half

1:47:36.780,1:47:44.360
somersaults Pike 3.0 and she's looking

1:47:40.080,1:47:44.360
very serene on that three meter board

1:47:44.750,1:47:52.500
yeah it's really really steady yeah the

1:47:50.760,1:47:53.820
coaches know that she's easily through

1:47:52.500,1:47:56.010
the prelims and that's what the divers

1:47:53.820,1:47:57.630
are looking to do today smile from

1:47:56.010,1:48:00.210
Charlene they're finishing on the inward

1:47:57.630,1:48:02.790
two and a half in the pike position as

1:48:00.210,1:48:04.310
we know 3.0 this is normally a best dive

1:48:02.790,1:48:06.990
and it's certainly there for her today

1:48:04.310,1:48:09.390
beautiful entry into the water seven and

1:48:06.990,1:48:11.040
a half Sun short steady performance

1:48:09.390,1:48:13.200
today from Charlene she will definitely

1:48:11.040,1:48:15.270
be in the semi-final tomorrow

1:48:13.200,1:48:16.800
well she performs like this in the semi

1:48:15.270,1:48:18.410
final she'll be back for the final as

1:48:16.800,1:48:20.250
well because that's a really good

1:48:18.410,1:48:22.050
collection of dives that she's done

1:48:20.250,1:48:24.810
today never really looked in any trouble

1:48:22.050,1:48:28.590
at all shiny and Stratton take about and

1:48:24.810,1:48:32.610
move on supposed to catch the dick off

1:48:28.590,1:48:35.400
food mmm still not quite there 15th is

1:48:32.610,1:48:37.530
all right now there's not a lot of room

1:48:35.400,1:48:39.630
for manoeuvre if things go wrong inward

1:48:37.530,1:48:42.720
two and a half somersaults with Pike

1:48:39.630,1:48:47.280
running off her program with a 3.0

1:48:42.720,1:48:49.950
degree of difficulty or very good the

1:48:47.280,1:48:55.530
pressure was on catcher needed to

1:48:49.950,1:48:57.030
respond in order to get through just

1:48:55.530,1:48:59.280
making a way to the side that here we go

1:48:57.030,1:49:01.230
on the replay squeezing into the Pike

1:48:59.280,1:49:04.530
shape looking for that vertical entry

1:49:01.230,1:49:07.740
into the water and there it is seven 7.5

1:49:04.530,1:49:10.520
s and secure berth into the semi-final

1:49:07.740,1:49:10.520
I'm guessing

1:49:10.980,1:49:16.180
there's the marks for catch up and we

1:49:13.450,1:49:18.970
will see her again in the semi-final six

1:49:16.180,1:49:22.810
or seven point five zero now once a

1:49:18.970,1:49:25.600
synchronized swimmer now a diver our

1:49:22.810,1:49:28.660
Starling is on the verge of a first

1:49:25.600,1:49:31.660
Olympic semi final and the

1:49:28.660,1:49:32.020
seventeen-year-old Basin leads soak it

1:49:31.660,1:49:33.880
all in

1:49:32.020,1:49:36.060
she's taking it all in see but look on

1:49:33.880,1:49:38.710
her face is quite overwhelming for her

1:49:36.060,1:49:42.240
for two and a half summer sorts one

1:49:38.710,1:49:51.190
twist in the pike position for Hannah

1:49:42.240,1:49:53.830
seventeenth after Round four Oh so to

1:49:51.190,1:49:56.950

cheers when she just stood on the diving

1:49:59.950,1:50:06.430
board then she's smiling and she should

1:50:02.470,1:50:12.790
be too though the Union Jack's wow what

1:50:06.430,1:50:15.010

speeding in there we are

1:50:17.950,1:50:21.580
head up a little bit in the twist there

1:50:19.660,1:50:23.940
two and a half somersaults vertical

1:50:21.580,1:50:28.660
entry in sevens to boots

1:50:23.940,1:50:30.700
63 go for a plunge get ready maybe for

1:50:28.660,1:50:32.500
tomorrow she's put herself in a really

1:50:30.700,1:50:34.720
good position to do that last die for

1:50:32.500,1:50:38.650
Marion for Izzy eight it's a reverse two

1:50:34.720,1:50:41.200
and a half just short of vertical as she

1:50:38.650,1:50:43.240
goes in there hasn't had the best

1:50:41.200,1:50:45.400
performance today but only twenty years

1:50:43.240,1:50:47.920
old both French girls very young

1:50:45.400,1:50:50.080
inexperienced and here in the Olympic

1:50:47.920,1:50:53.650
preliminary this is where you get your

1:50:50.080,1:50:58.950
big big learnings finishing on one of

1:50:53.650,1:51:04.139
her better dives today lots to take away

1:50:58.950,1:51:07.920
51 that's where she finishes and

1:51:04.139,1:51:12.840
takes her leave as we welcome onto the

1:51:07.920,1:51:15.270
board the Italian Francesca dalip 8 this

1:51:12.840,1:51:16.739
needs to finish things off here the

1:51:15.270,1:51:18.090
forward two and a half somersaults and

1:51:16.739,1:51:20.760
one twists and she can bring in that

1:51:18.090,1:51:28.020
program all over again in about twenty

1:51:20.760,1:51:30.210
two hours time well good strong finish

1:51:28.020,1:51:33.090
faltered a little bit on mines three and

1:51:30.210,1:51:35.699
four opened up electrically one and two

1:51:33.090,1:51:38.010
final dive back from the end of the

1:51:35.699,1:51:41.100
diving board again which is Oh making it

1:51:38.010,1:51:42.750
so difficult here we go if we ever see

1:51:41.100,1:51:43.969
the replay there we go a little bit back

1:51:42.750,1:51:46.710
from the end of the diving board

1:51:43.969,1:51:47.790
completes the dive well but it could

1:51:46.710,1:51:49.949
have been better issues on the end

1:51:47.790,1:51:51.480
sevens I think quite a bit of splash at

1:51:49.949,1:51:56.190
the end there too which I'm sure the

1:51:51.480,1:51:58.199
judges will have noted she knows that's

1:51:56.190,1:52:03.270
not quite how she wanted to execute that

1:51:58.199,1:52:06.119
but 63 he's okay and would be too many

1:52:03.270,1:52:07.350
alarms for her as opposed to this lady

1:52:06.119,1:52:10.489
there's one place away from

1:52:07.350,1:52:13.409
qualification and the stage yeah

1:52:10.489,1:52:16.650
Wozniacki Evert of Russia this needs to

1:52:13.409,1:52:19.619
be special or she needed to dig deep and

1:52:16.650,1:52:21.300
it's good but I think it needed to be

1:52:19.619,1:52:23.580
better to assure her the place you will

1:52:21.300,1:52:26.670
have an agonizing wait now to see if

1:52:23.580,1:52:28.230
that is good enough it's 3.0 forward two

1:52:26.670,1:52:30.780
and a half is one and a half somersaults

1:52:28.230,1:52:32.760
there's the one twist and then entry

1:52:30.780,1:52:34.320
into the water the toes are pointed at

1:52:32.760,1:52:37.139
six and a half's I think she would have

1:52:34.320,1:52:40.289
wanted seven 7.50 obviously she'd have

1:52:37.139,1:52:43.619
been delighted with higher than that

1:52:40.289,1:52:46.709
not into the 60s I think that may just

1:52:43.619,1:52:49.189
harm her chances are being back for war

1:52:46.709,1:52:53.489
in the semi-finals

1:52:49.189,1:52:55.319
Nora schinsky needs to get the job done

1:52:53.489,1:52:58.979
here on this forward two and a half and

1:52:55.319,1:53:03.929
one twist 3.0 because she's 15th with

1:52:58.979,1:53:07.019
her last I have coming up oh yeah steady

1:53:03.929,1:53:08.789
last dive very consistent both Germans

1:53:07.019,1:53:11.519
consistently today there's the team

1:53:08.789,1:53:13.289
supporting them she's not the most

1:53:11.519,1:53:16.439
elegant of divers but she's certainly

1:53:13.289,1:53:20.039
very functional you've got up and down

1:53:16.439,1:53:23.329
into the water looking for the vertical

1:53:20.039,1:53:26.609
entry and there it is it's 3.0 mid-60s

1:53:23.329,1:53:28.260
and certainly a place in the semi-final

1:53:26.609,1:53:34.559
you should have your hair like that

1:53:28.260,1:53:37.979
didn't you marks for that dive 7.5 7

1:53:34.559,1:53:43.199
point 5 and 7 and 66 is the total score

1:53:37.979,1:53:45.749
for efficient ski Jennifer Abel who's

1:53:43.199,1:53:47.159
lived up to her name tonight she'll

1:53:45.749,1:53:50.059
finish off with a forward two and a half

1:53:47.159,1:53:52.709
somersaults with one twist

1:53:50.059,1:53:54.449
well Jennifer's not able to get on the

1:53:52.709,1:53:57.179
end of the diving board but she's very

1:53:54.449,1:54:00.649
able of completing the dive effortlessly

1:53:57.179,1:54:02.849
you start me off there Bob so here we go

1:54:00.649,1:54:07.349
into the end of the diving board

1:54:02.849,1:54:08.909
squeezing in so easy beautiful entry

1:54:07.349,1:54:12.899
into the water imagine if she was on the

1:54:08.909,1:54:16.019
end of the diving board she would have

1:54:12.899,1:54:18.839
got so much more height and made the

1:54:16.019,1:54:21.389
dive even easier eights across the board

1:54:18.839,1:54:24.030
- that's alright great dive very good in

1:54:21.389,1:54:25.859
fact 72 will get her up in the upper

1:54:24.030,1:54:28.769
stratosphere of this particular

1:54:25.859,1:54:30.119
competition and Limburg has a few little

1:54:28.769,1:54:32.609
difficulties but she's worked her way

1:54:30.119,1:54:34.619
into the top ten officially off for the

1:54:32.609,1:54:38.789
for two and a half with one twist the

1:54:34.619,1:54:41.189
pike position Oh little bit of

1:54:38.789,1:54:43.469
discrepancy entering the water net a

1:54:41.189,1:54:45.149
little bit slow on a rotation which

1:54:43.469,1:54:46.859
meant the completion of the dive was put

1:54:45.149,1:54:48.569
under pressure she wasn't quite straight

1:54:46.859,1:54:50.729
on the end as she went in here we go

1:54:48.569,1:54:52.439
squeezing into the Pike shape releasing

1:54:50.729,1:54:54.300
fitting in that one twist and as you can

1:54:52.439,1:54:56.550
see here Anna just running out

1:54:54.300,1:54:59.490
staying in a slight dished position as

1:54:56.550,1:55:02.670
she went in six is 6.5 s from the judges

1:54:59.490,1:55:04.110
I'm predicting let's see if your

1:55:02.670,1:55:09.810
prediction is true of course it's always

1:55:04.110,1:55:11.370
true 76.5 s for Anna Lindbergh the time

1:55:09.810,1:55:14.190
being up into third place you won't

1:55:11.370,1:55:16.890
remain there for very long nope Kristina

1:55:14.190,1:55:20.550
Lucas of the USA finishing off her

1:55:16.890,1:55:23.010
program eight after round four for two

1:55:20.550,1:55:26.760
and a half one twist in the pike

1:55:23.010,1:55:28.740
position again not wanting to get on the

1:55:26.760,1:55:30.300
end of the diving board obviously seems

1:55:28.740,1:55:31.200
some of the girls landing over the end

1:55:30.300,1:55:33.330
of the diving board

1:55:31.200,1:55:35.100
Lucas Blaney playing a little bit safe

1:55:33.330,1:55:38.430
on her approach there making the dive

1:55:35.100,1:55:40.470
tough yeah back from the end but such a

1:55:38.430,1:55:43.050
strong athlete very powerful and dynamic

1:55:40.470,1:55:44.820
able to get enough height and generate

1:55:43.050,1:55:48.240
enough rotation in order to complete the

1:55:44.820,1:55:49.740
dive very well indeed she'd have been up

1:55:48.240,1:55:52.500
in the 70s if she was on the end of the

1:55:49.740,1:55:57.510
diving board that's probably late 60s

1:55:52.500,1:56:00.180
now 60 7.50 to be precise that's all

1:55:57.510,1:56:01.260
right look overly chuffed about what

1:56:00.180,1:56:03.960
she's achieved today but she has

1:56:01.260,1:56:08.880
achieved a top 18 finish that's all she

1:56:03.960,1:56:12.000
needs now Sanchez Sato

1:56:08.880,1:56:14.700
that's their final dive forward two and

1:56:12.000,1:56:16.380
a half again yet two and a half with one

1:56:14.700,1:56:19.920
twist and that's probably know as best

1:56:16.380,1:56:21.570
I've to finish on there they take off

1:56:19.920,1:56:22.980
seem to be quite steady some of the

1:56:21.570,1:56:24.570
others she's been spinning sideways a

1:56:22.980,1:56:27.570
little bit towards the judges this one

1:56:24.570,1:56:28.800
looked pretty square on slightly back

1:56:27.570,1:56:30.390
from the end of the diving board there

1:56:28.800,1:56:32.540
but didn't seem to affect her that's a

1:56:30.390,1:56:34.710
really strong dive to finish on and

1:56:32.540,1:56:37.280
certainly secures a place going through

1:56:34.710,1:56:37.280
to the semis

1:56:39.050,1:56:44.900
Swayne for the marks to be confirmed and

1:56:41.420,1:56:46.460
they are now on your screen 7.5 s across

1:56:44.900,1:56:50.300
the board sixty seven point five zero

1:56:46.460,1:56:52.720
and she has moved up into the top four

1:56:50.300,1:56:55.130
but that will be a temporary position

1:56:52.720,1:56:59.270
could enough atop eighteen almost

1:56:55.130,1:57:03.350
certainly now let's dive from egg of

1:56:59.270,1:57:06.800
malaysia oh and she's finished on her

1:57:03.350,1:57:08.630
best i've only nineteen years old

1:57:06.800,1:57:10.340
invaluable experience here at the

1:57:08.630,1:57:11.870
olympic games she's been a bit here and

1:57:10.340,1:57:13.820
there throughout the program but at

1:57:11.870,1:57:15.070
least she's finished strongly this a

1:57:13.820,1:57:17.530
three point zero

1:57:15.070,1:57:20.300
he's got a lot of potential this girl

1:57:17.530,1:57:25.430
i'm sure we'll see her featuring again

1:57:20.300,1:57:28.190
and again on the way to rio just a

1:57:25.430,1:57:30.050
little over vertical as she went in as a

1:57:28.190,1:57:32.930
smile we've been waiting for as i must

1:57:30.050,1:57:37.220
smile about today but finally breaking

1:57:32.930,1:57:43.580
out into the room a grim 58.50 for the

1:57:37.220,1:57:46.120
malaysian tan yet can yato italy fishing

1:57:43.580,1:57:48.530
off reverse two-and-a-half with Mike

1:57:46.120,1:57:53.510
again three point zero

1:57:48.530,1:57:54.110
Oh fantastic dive this is Tonya's best

1:57:53.510,1:57:56.750
dive

1:57:54.110,1:57:59.330
she's as the European champion is their

1:57:56.750,1:58:01.370
fourth Olympic Games and she's got to

1:57:59.330,1:58:03.170
make the cut and I think she would be in

1:58:01.370,1:58:05.810
the top three she certainly was after

1:58:03.170,1:58:08.870
four rounds and that's a very very well

1:58:05.810,1:58:12.470
executed dive likely to get over 70

1:58:08.870,1:58:16.550
points beautiful splash let's entry into

1:58:12.470,1:58:18.410
the water how many marks well seventy

1:58:16.550,1:58:22.010
two yeah it's a very good reaction a

1:58:18.410,1:58:23.990
very good score for her and those three

1:58:22.010,1:58:26.810
eighths will take care right into the

1:58:23.990,1:58:29.540
upper echelon of this competition Chung

1:58:26.810,1:58:31.430
o Malaysia well suppose she's still an

1:58:29.540,1:58:32.870
outside chance a twenty first place of a

1:58:31.430,1:58:34.220
progression here so let's see what she

1:58:32.870,1:58:37.600
can do with this reverse one and a half

1:58:34.220,1:58:43.060
somersaults and to an hour of twists

1:58:37.600,1:58:46.490
what a beautiful dive Wow

1:58:43.060,1:58:48.290
very very neat and tidy it's almost a

1:58:46.490,1:58:50.630
classic dive this one one and a half

1:58:48.290,1:58:52.160
somersaults reverse with two and a half

1:58:50.630,1:58:54.380
twist here we are landing on the end

1:58:52.160,1:58:56.630
comes up here's the two and a half twist

1:58:54.380,1:58:59.360
only one and a half somersaults very

1:58:56.630,1:59:01.910
beautiful little bit of a discrepancy

1:58:59.360,1:59:03.890
there as she went into the water maybe

1:59:01.910,1:59:05.630
are some more fingernail and toes shots

1:59:03.890,1:59:07.250
there but let's have a look we're gonna

1:59:05.630,1:59:08.810
see another replay but no those are the

1:59:07.250,1:59:10.580
marks bit of a mixed bag six and a half

1:59:08.810,1:59:12.620
to eight and a half yeah I don't think I

1:59:10.580,1:59:14.990
should be worth more than 2.9 my

1:59:12.620,1:59:16.400
untrained idly I think - boy knows a bit

1:59:14.990,1:59:18.110
too bit mean on actually what you have

1:59:16.400,1:59:21.110
to do in terms of the execution of that

1:59:18.110,1:59:24.110
dive to get it in place but you know I'm

1:59:21.110,1:59:28.700
not the expert judges are Cassie Krug

1:59:24.110,1:59:30.770
finishing off with this now it's strong

1:59:28.700,1:59:33.500
start a little bit here and there in the

1:59:30.770,1:59:35.360
middle and a strong finish she's moved

1:59:33.500,1:59:37.880
down into where she was 12 after the

1:59:35.360,1:59:40.430
fourth round and that's a fantastic dive

1:59:37.880,1:59:43.660
to finish that will secure her a spot

1:59:40.430,1:59:47.750
you'll get over 70 points just I think

1:59:43.660,1:59:51.170
very strong diver very well executed and

1:59:47.750,1:59:52.640
welcome to the semi-finals yeah wishing

1:59:51.170,1:59:54.410
it all over again once you change your

1:59:52.640,1:59:56.210
program tomorrow as the program will see

1:59:54.410,1:59:59.300
from these divers again I think most of

1:59:56.210,2:00:02.630
them will keep it the same come the

1:59:59.300,2:00:03.890
marks eight eight right across the board

2:00:02.630,2:00:09.500
there that makes it an easy calculation

2:00:03.890,2:00:18.850
for you 24 times 3 makes 72 modesta

2:00:09.500,2:00:21.280
buzina russia in seventh place

2:00:18.850,2:00:24.580
and that'll be good enough to hold that

2:00:21.280,2:00:25.720
place definitely he's performed very

2:00:24.580,2:00:28.840
consistently today

2:00:25.720,2:00:30.760
Anastasia her business partner as in

2:00:28.840,2:00:32.790
teammate she'll have an agonizing wait

2:00:30.760,2:00:36.370
she hasn't been on a game

2:00:32.790,2:00:38.770
this Russian diver is on her game she'll

2:00:36.370,2:00:40.810
definitely be in the top ten she's done

2:00:38.770,2:00:43.480
her job this morning this afternoon I

2:00:40.810,2:00:47.920
mean that she'll be featuring again

2:00:43.480,2:00:53.880
tomorrow in the semi-final 60.9 zero

2:00:47.920,2:00:53.880
again nice calculation for you and 70s

2:00:55.650,2:01:02.170
on to chavez munos afraid she was the

2:01:00.220,2:01:04.530
bottom of the pile after round one and

2:01:02.170,2:01:07.510
she hasn't moved away from that sense

2:01:04.530,2:01:09.960
inward two and a half somersaults with

2:01:07.510,2:01:12.760
pike biggest I have to win the with oh

2:01:09.960,2:01:15.250
sure - vertical as she went in she's had

2:01:12.760,2:01:18.460
a tough day out there today only 21

2:01:15.250,2:01:22.570
years old at least experience of these

2:01:18.460,2:01:26.080
two Mexicans in the prelim here it's her

2:01:22.570,2:01:28.660
campaign closing right there so you take

2:01:26.080,2:01:30.850
some positives away great experience

2:01:28.660,2:01:33.580
competing against the world's very very

2:01:30.850,2:01:36.400
best and apart from a pretty disastrous

2:01:33.580,2:01:38.470
first round dive she stayed with it and

2:01:36.400,2:01:41.140
carried on trying hard great experience

2:01:38.470,2:01:46.210
soap and limpid games for her and she

2:01:41.140,2:01:49.360
will return as indeed will this diver as

2:01:46.210,2:01:50.800
he forward two and a half with one twist

2:01:49.360,2:01:54.269
to end off her

2:01:50.800,2:01:57.449
very impressive program

2:01:54.269,2:02:00.360
nor just letting the dive go over a

2:01:57.449,2:02:02.670
vertical her Z not completely on her

2:02:00.360,2:02:05.280
game today but she doesn't need to be

2:02:02.670,2:02:07.829
just an average performance we'll get

2:02:05.280,2:02:10.409
her through to the semi-finals easily

2:02:07.829,2:02:12.570
and this is probably her weakest I've of

2:02:10.409,2:02:14.610
the program today just over a vertical

2:02:12.570,2:02:16.559
as she goes in there having to roll to

2:02:14.610,2:02:17.999
try and save the dive to give the

2:02:16.559,2:02:20.820
impression to the judges that she's not

2:02:17.999,2:02:22.920
over a vertical in fact that they needed

2:02:20.820,2:02:25.289
to to be a little bit more sneaky than

2:02:22.920,2:02:27.420
that to confuse the judges let's see

2:02:25.289,2:02:28.679
what do they think they think 7s 1

2:02:27.420,2:02:30.749
thoughts there were two thoughts in

2:02:28.679,2:02:34.369
point five but they weren't count so 63

2:02:30.749,2:02:37.289
is the total marks for the Chinese

2:02:34.369,2:02:39.599
doesn't hang around does she forward two

2:02:37.289,2:02:42.719
and a half with one twist well that's

2:02:39.599,2:02:44.670
three out of the last three the federal

2:02:42.719,2:02:47.190
/ first two was shaky she's worked

2:02:44.670,2:02:47.999
tirelessly and very hard to get back in

2:02:47.190,2:02:51.420
contention

2:02:47.999,2:02:52.949
she was 14th after four rounds I think

2:02:51.420,2:02:54.869
that might sneak him up a little bit

2:02:52.949,2:02:57.420
which she'll be particularly pleased

2:02:54.869,2:03:01.619
with because she'll be making her way

2:02:57.420,2:03:05.510
through to the semi-final tomorrow yeah

2:03:01.619,2:03:09.630
for 14th greed now up into 12th position

2:03:05.510,2:03:12.320
for Elena feather over at 66 and she

2:03:09.630,2:03:14.749
will be part of the semi-final lineup

2:03:12.320,2:03:18.840
tomorrow

2:03:14.749,2:03:20.309
Castillo Suarez however will not again

2:03:18.840,2:03:21.869
just for Pride

2:03:20.309,2:03:23.429
she'll be hoping that the inward

2:03:21.869,2:03:27.320
two-and-a-half she's about to perform is

2:03:23.429,2:03:27.320
the best that she can do

2:03:36.080,2:03:44.120
oh she's finished on a good one

2:03:40.870,2:03:46.070
left herself too much to do 26 after the

2:03:44.120,2:03:47.900
the previous round of course top 18

2:03:46.070,2:03:50.060
going through to tomorrow's semi-final

2:03:47.900,2:03:52.100
but this the m-word standing backwards

2:03:50.060,2:03:54.350
spinning forwards towards a diving board

2:03:52.100,2:03:57.290
looking for that vertical entry little

2:03:54.350,2:03:58.910
bit over a vertical it'll get sevens and

2:03:57.290,2:04:01.190
that's a valiant effort final round dive

2:03:58.910,2:04:04.700
from the young Venezuelan only 21 years

2:04:01.190,2:04:06.770
old yeah give firm that she doesn't

2:04:04.700,2:04:09.620
qualify won't qualify in 19th place

2:04:06.770,2:04:10.630
they're three sevens goodbye it thank

2:04:09.620,2:04:16.880
you

2:04:10.630,2:04:19.640
now to Ming chef it was in first place

2:04:16.880,2:04:24.350
over the last round get to hold on to

2:04:19.640,2:04:26.690
that and Composition as she gets ready

2:04:24.350,2:04:32.380
for her back two-and-a-half somersaults

2:04:26.690,2:04:36.770
with Pike 3.0 for the Chinese yes

2:04:32.380,2:04:38.270
sensational Wow I think that is a little

2:04:36.770,2:04:40.520
hat tip to what's to come

2:04:38.270,2:04:42.170
those are the kind of dives that Wu has

2:04:40.520,2:04:44.540
in a diving Bank and that she can

2:04:42.170,2:04:47.210
withdraw them anytime and execute at

2:04:44.540,2:04:50.330
will that's near one perfect for me nine

2:04:47.210,2:04:52.370
point five s maybe even a ten if it was

2:04:50.330,2:04:54.080
a final I'm sure the judges would give

2:04:52.370,2:04:55.610
it a ten but this is prelims maybe

2:04:54.080,2:04:57.680
they're going to leave themselves

2:04:55.610,2:05:00.560
somewhere to go but that is near on

2:04:57.680,2:05:02.360
perfection from the Olympic champion in

2:05:00.560,2:05:06.050
the three metre synchro there you go

2:05:02.360,2:05:08.650
nine point five nine point five and 984

2:05:06.050,2:05:13.880
i think the biggest mark we've had today

2:05:08.650,2:05:20.000
for the chinese the raw greets rebecca

2:05:13.880,2:05:21.680
gallantry 16 after Round four she's seen

2:05:20.000,2:05:23.780
all this before that she hasn't seen it

2:05:21.680,2:05:27.580
with the 17 a half thousand people

2:05:23.780,2:05:32.120
screaming at her it's a home crowd

2:05:27.580,2:05:35.390
composure before Rebecca some can't

2:05:32.120,2:05:37.580
watch behind their fingers back two and

2:05:35.390,2:05:40.550
a half somersaults with Pike this for

2:05:37.580,2:05:43.370
progression just as Morrow semi-final oh

2:05:40.550,2:05:45.290
it's good that I think that'll be good

2:05:43.370,2:05:47.720
enough to get through to the semi-finals

2:05:45.290,2:05:48.510
Wow emotional stuff here in the Aquatic

2:05:47.720,2:05:50.970
Centre

2:05:48.510,2:05:53.550
Rebecca that's a solid performance good

2:05:50.970,2:05:55.470
last I allows herself a smile high

2:05:53.550,2:05:58.020
pressure out there today high

2:05:55.470,2:05:59.970
expectations for these British girls to

2:05:58.020,2:06:02.340
make it through to the semi-final was

2:05:59.970,2:06:04.860
their goal tipping over a vertical line

2:06:02.340,2:06:07.320
should be good enough for sevens which

2:06:04.860,2:06:08.760
will get him over 60 points which she

2:06:07.320,2:06:11.220
was in 16th from the previous round

2:06:08.760,2:06:13.400
should keep her in contention for going

2:06:11.220,2:06:15.840
through not that many divers left

2:06:13.400,2:06:19.290
fingers crossed for Rebecca gallantry

2:06:15.840,2:06:21.360
keep that smile on there 15th place for

2:06:19.290,2:06:24.510
Rebecca Allen treat this mence kept

2:06:21.360,2:06:26.460
hanging around no wanting to get that

2:06:24.510,2:06:28.560
dive lodged as soon as you can obviously

2:06:26.460,2:06:31.110
wants to go home maybe she's looking

2:06:28.560,2:06:33.600
forward to a dinner will she be coming

2:06:31.110,2:06:35.370
back for the semi finals tomorrow 22nd

2:06:33.600,2:06:37.950
after the fourth round I think that

2:06:35.370,2:06:39.600
might not be enough I have to wait and

2:06:37.950,2:06:41.100
see until all the divers have finished

2:06:39.600,2:06:43.500
and agonizing wait for some of these

2:06:41.100,2:06:46.020
competitors of course every single dive

2:06:43.500,2:06:47.670
counts that'll get sevens but sevens

2:06:46.020,2:06:49.170
probably won't be good enough back from

2:06:47.670,2:06:55.500
the end of the diving board makes it

2:06:49.170,2:06:58.560
tricky shame for the 2nd Ukrainian it's

2:06:55.500,2:07:01.560
no progression for his men Scott 19th

2:06:58.560,2:07:04.050
place is where she couldn't up could end

2:07:01.560,2:07:06.930
up a little bit low but you know top 18

2:07:04.050,2:07:10.950
place for her today nor for Fannie

2:07:06.930,2:07:14.360
Bouvet our France very low tariffs in

2:07:10.950,2:07:18.090
all of her dives includes this last one

2:07:14.360,2:07:19.500
2.7 might win an award for the costume

2:07:18.090,2:07:23.160
though in word two and a half

2:07:19.500,2:07:25.350
somersaults were tuck well she's

2:07:23.160,2:07:27.090
finished on her favorite dive again if

2:07:25.350,2:07:29.100
you look back at her performance it's

2:07:27.090,2:07:31.380
been pretty steady but as Bob mentioned

2:07:29.100,2:07:34.050
the degree of difficulty is very very

2:07:31.380,2:07:35.880
low on all of these dives she's only 18

2:07:34.050,2:07:37.970
years old looking to gain her Olympic

2:07:35.880,2:07:39.840
experience and she certainly got that

2:07:37.970,2:07:41.970
and it should be quite pleased with

2:07:39.840,2:07:43.739
their performance today to make through

2:07:41.970,2:07:46.260
to the semi-finals with a list of low

2:07:43.739,2:07:47.670
degree of difficulties a big ask and it

2:07:46.260,2:07:50.600
certainly won't be progressing funny

2:07:47.670,2:07:50.600
past the prelims

2:07:51.070,2:07:55.330
how she finished what scores she got

2:07:53.140,2:07:59.940
fifty one point three zero six point

2:07:55.330,2:07:59.940
five I'm sure we'll see Fanny again

2:08:00.420,2:08:06.400
Jennifer Benitez of Spain with her last

2:08:05.080,2:08:09.790
time and it will be her last time in

2:08:06.400,2:08:11.260
this competition Wow she hasn't had a

2:08:09.790,2:08:13.180
great day out there today

2:08:11.260,2:08:15.070
mrs. reverse one and a half somersaults

2:08:13.180,2:08:17.770
with one and a half twist it's only two

2:08:15.070,2:08:19.120
point five degree of difficulty so so

2:08:17.770,2:08:20.650
easy just landing on the end of the

2:08:19.120,2:08:23.080
diving board they're leaning back quite

2:08:20.650,2:08:25.060
a lot then you haven't you jump forward

2:08:23.080,2:08:27.340
in order to move clear of the diving

2:08:25.060,2:08:30.070
board yeah lots of little errors there

2:08:27.340,2:08:31.360
she's struggled today and won't be very

2:08:30.070,2:08:34.410
pleased without at all

2:08:31.360,2:08:35.770
twenty-seven just trying to find the

2:08:34.410,2:08:38.280
scoreboard

2:08:35.770,2:08:41.080
when I finally coach at the same time

2:08:38.280,2:08:44.080
time to go and get ready to go home

2:08:41.080,2:08:46.780
that's not what she came here to do nor

2:08:44.080,2:08:49.120
indeed does it mean for Giuliano Veloso

2:08:46.780,2:08:53.110
to be her last time in the competition

2:08:49.120,2:08:55.510
full-stop Giuliano really struggling

2:08:53.110,2:08:57.220
there some of these dyes are very very

2:08:55.510,2:08:58.810
difficult in fact all of the dyes she's

2:08:57.220,2:09:00.820
performed a very difficult this one in

2:08:58.810,2:09:02.860
particular three point one degree of

2:09:00.820,2:09:04.510
difficulty landing back from the end of

2:09:02.860,2:09:06.640
the diving board and that isn't very

2:09:04.510,2:09:08.530
good then she's got to squeeze into that

2:09:06.640,2:09:10.510
Pike shape you can see they're running

2:09:08.530,2:09:12.580
out of room landing shorter vertical

2:09:10.510,2:09:14.320
throwing up a load of splash that's

2:09:12.580,2:09:16.360
going to get a low low mark and there

2:09:14.320,2:09:19.780
you go 35 ouch

2:09:16.360,2:09:22.480
35 25 in terms of position in the

2:09:19.780,2:09:27.010
competition and she shall not be

2:09:22.480,2:09:29.740
returning for the last 18 jail Patrick

2:09:27.010,2:09:33.550
is in the very final position for

2:09:29.740,2:09:36.760
qualification saying this has to be

2:09:33.550,2:09:39.250
precise has to be good she's just taking

2:09:36.760,2:09:43.020
a little bit more time over this inward

2:09:39.250,2:09:45.220
two-and-a-half some margin between

2:09:43.020,2:09:47.640
thousand sixteen seventeen eighteen

2:09:45.220,2:09:49.960
nineteen and twenty was marginal before

2:09:47.640,2:09:51.959
she could underline her position in the

2:09:49.960,2:09:54.389
semis with this

2:09:51.959,2:09:56.099
well yeah it's a little bit low

2:09:54.389,2:09:58.260
finishing on the water it is up like

2:09:56.099,2:10:00.900
it's vertical the entry into the water

2:09:58.260,2:10:02.579
is neat and tidy she can squeeze six and

2:10:00.900,2:10:04.979
a half's and sevens from the judges on

2:10:02.579,2:10:05.880
this which I think she might well it's

2:10:04.979,2:10:07.229
gonna be close

2:10:05.880,2:10:09.539
he's gonna have to wait there's a couple

2:10:07.229,2:10:11.849
more divers to go just three more divers

2:10:09.539,2:10:13.709
to complete this so let's see I think

2:10:11.849,2:10:15.389
that might just be enough and we could

2:10:13.709,2:10:17.249
see more from jail as she goes through

2:10:15.389,2:10:18.510
to the semi colons aren't happy with

2:10:17.249,2:10:20.179
that overall performance

2:10:18.510,2:10:24.349
she should be much higher up than that

2:10:20.179,2:10:27.599
seventeenth now she hasn't qualified yet

2:10:24.349,2:10:30.239
Rebecca Gallen tree has kept giving her

2:10:27.599,2:10:33.659
what four starlings having to wait as

2:10:30.239,2:10:35.159
well she hasn't qualified yet the queue

2:10:33.659,2:10:39.110
hasn't come up beside her neighbors yet

2:10:35.159,2:10:45.809
but down up a feather over takeoff and

2:10:39.110,2:10:47.789
gallantry are through Nora barter she's

2:10:45.809,2:10:52.110
flirted with the top 18 she's been in

2:10:47.789,2:10:53.729
the top 18 December 25th here's a final

2:10:52.110,2:10:57.269
dime it's only worth two point eight in

2:10:53.729,2:11:00.689
terms of tariff projecting yourself on

2:10:57.269,2:11:02.820
the standings no that is a neat and tidy

2:11:00.689,2:11:04.590
dive instead back one and a half

2:11:02.820,2:11:05.999
somersaults with two and a half twists

2:11:04.590,2:11:09.360
only two point eight degree of

2:11:05.999,2:11:11.070
difficulty and we are wrapping into the

2:11:09.360,2:11:12.959
two and a half twists as she enters the

2:11:11.070,2:11:14.760
water here she's under twisted or

2:11:12.959,2:11:17.300
slightly over twisted which if the

2:11:14.760,2:11:20.130
judges spot that will penalize heavily

2:11:17.300,2:11:22.380
as we grab her hands as she goes in or a

2:11:20.130,2:11:24.510
tough day at the office I don't think

2:11:22.380,2:11:26.550
she will be progressing and no she won't

2:11:24.510,2:11:29.999
and that dive means that Hannah Starling

2:11:26.550,2:11:32.340
has made the semi-final she has the big

2:11:29.999,2:11:35.869
queue on our computer screen here to

2:11:32.340,2:11:39.179
indicate that she has made the last 18

2:11:35.869,2:11:41.010
Patrick is not as yes the Australians

2:11:39.179,2:11:44.929
just hanging on to wait and see whether

2:11:41.010,2:11:48.900
she gets into semi-finals

2:11:44.929,2:11:51.329
Emily Haman's it's been a model of

2:11:48.900,2:11:54.479
consistency today she fishes off a

2:11:51.329,2:11:58.170
program back two and a half yeah it's

2:11:54.479,2:12:00.449
good she'll progress through easily to

2:11:58.170,2:12:02.459
the semi-finals and of course all the

2:12:00.449,2:12:04.650
divers start from zero so it's the top

2:12:02.459,2:12:05.290
18 you will dive in reverse order it

2:12:04.650,2:12:07.480
will be a

2:12:05.290,2:12:10.510
Plus to tomorrow afternoon local time

2:12:07.480,2:12:12.340
and Emily Haman's already her medalist

2:12:10.510,2:12:14.470
here from these games in fact she's won

2:12:12.340,2:12:16.960
an Olympic medal at the Pratt past four

2:12:14.470,2:12:20.860
Olympic Games and she progresses through

2:12:16.960,2:12:23.500
to the semi-finals here are the marks

2:12:20.860,2:12:25.900
and they're good they're solid and then

2:12:23.500,2:12:28.960
consistent 7.5 coach is happy she's

2:12:25.900,2:12:32.730
happy and she will return for more in

2:12:28.960,2:12:37.630
the semi finals still up for grabs

2:12:32.730,2:12:39.970
terms the top 18 that's biggis flora

2:12:37.630,2:12:42.250
gone dose could do it she's got to make

2:12:39.970,2:12:44.350
a twenty point twenty point differential

2:12:42.250,2:12:46.600
though from 2.8 I don't think it's quite

2:12:44.350,2:12:48.370
gonna do it for a back one-and-a-half

2:12:46.600,2:12:51.070
somersaults two and a half twists choice

2:12:48.370,2:12:53.500
it's okay and as Bob mentioned it's only

2:12:51.070,2:12:56.320
2.8 back one and a half somersaults two

2:12:53.500,2:12:58.030
and a half twist she's certainly beating

2:12:56.320,2:13:00.790
her teammate today though this is gone

2:12:58.030,2:13:02.830
dose going for a last dive last-ditch

2:13:00.790,2:13:04.960
effort to get through to the semi-finals

2:13:02.830,2:13:07.720
it won't be enough with that tipping

2:13:04.960,2:13:09.820
over a vertical as she goes in so she'll

2:13:07.720,2:13:11.230
be going home well staying to watch the

2:13:09.820,2:13:12.880
rest of the Olympic Games she will not

2:13:11.230,2:13:14.890
be featuring in the semi-final there's

2:13:12.880,2:13:17.410
the confirmation so you had fun out

2:13:14.890,2:13:21.760
there today though bright future ahead

2:13:17.410,2:13:24.160
of it yeah we love you to Flora three

2:13:21.760,2:13:26.530
little star can shoot in the future for

2:13:24.160,2:13:30.520
the big names missed out kasnia cover

2:13:26.530,2:13:34.120
didn't make the top 18 she's the first

2:13:30.520,2:13:38.020
casualty both the British girls making

2:13:34.120,2:13:40.960
it through though with Rebecca Gallen

2:13:38.020,2:13:41.590
treat in 16th place and how Starling and

2:13:40.960,2:13:43.950
there they are

2:13:41.590,2:13:46.090
in 17th they have their anxious wait

2:13:43.950,2:13:48.880
they don't have the information that we

2:13:46.090,2:13:50.500
have on our computer system and they'll

2:13:48.880,2:13:51.760
see in a moment they play actually have

2:13:50.500,2:13:54.970
worked it out for themselves with just

2:13:51.760,2:13:58.090
in case here is confirmation China one

2:13:54.970,2:14:01.420
and two Italy Canada Australia so all

2:13:58.090,2:14:04.750
the big names getting through 387 the

2:14:01.420,2:14:09.520
top scorer there for whoo if the

2:14:04.750,2:14:10.990
Americans making it through the only

2:14:09.520,2:14:14.730
port Bates to the crowd have just seen

2:14:10.990,2:14:14.730
it and now you see it

2:14:14.910,2:14:20.440
16th Rebecca gantry 17th Vanna Starling

2:14:18.700,2:14:21.780
jail Patrick just getting in the last

2:14:20.440,2:14:25.150
position

2:14:21.780,2:14:27.670
anastasiya Pozniak over does not go

2:14:25.150,2:14:32.910
through big surprise there's any one

2:14:27.670,2:14:35.500
Russian involved those on the last page

2:14:32.910,2:14:37.870
kind of thanks for coming but no

2:14:35.500,2:14:41.080
progression for them so table 18 will

2:14:37.870,2:14:44.140
then turn into top 12 for semi-finals

2:14:41.080,2:14:47.320
that's all the big names with the

2:14:44.140,2:14:55.360
exception of Pozniak over are through to

2:14:47.320,2:15:01.750
the semi-finals there's the delight for

2:14:55.360,2:15:03.420
the home fans the home coaches and just

2:15:01.750,2:15:06.520
filtering out of the building now

2:15:03.420,2:15:09.940
looking quite happy your life Yong

2:15:06.520,2:15:12.130
Yong's Hanna starlings coach he's done

2:15:09.940,2:15:14.980
some great work there are the girls the

2:15:12.130,2:15:17.230
local girls well I say home giving the

2:15:14.980,2:15:19.420
crowd a wave I've never seen a crowd

2:15:17.230,2:15:22.570
this busy for a preliminary competition

2:15:19.420,2:15:25.050
in the diving fantastic support here

2:15:22.570,2:15:27.520
certainly lifted the girls here today

2:15:25.050,2:15:29.710
raising their game making it through to

2:15:27.520,2:15:31.960
the semi-final look at that sea of Union

2:15:29.710,2:15:35.080
Jack's everyone still here in the

2:15:31.960,2:15:37.960
building girls on their way over to the

2:15:35.080,2:15:39.730
mix own to do the interviews fantastic

2:15:37.960,2:15:41.710
effort still some improve is to be made

2:15:39.730,2:15:43.090
and of course only the top 12 make it

2:15:41.710,2:15:45.100
through from the semi-finals

2:15:43.090,2:15:46.570
so if gallantry and Starling want to

2:15:45.100,2:15:48.970
make it through they need to up their

2:15:46.570,2:15:53.850
game but rather that than the other way

2:15:48.970,2:15:56.500
so all to play for 24 hours to get ready

2:15:53.850,2:15:59.200
1430 British summer time we shall return

2:15:56.500,2:16:02.170
with the semi-finals top 18 whittled

2:15:59.200,2:16:04.780
