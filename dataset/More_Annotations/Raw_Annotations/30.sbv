0:00:00.030,0:00:05.430
by Olympic silver medalist from 2004 in

0:00:02.939,0:00:07.770
the 10 metre synchro diving Leon Taylor

0:00:05.430,0:00:09.240
Leon a few things to say who are the

0:00:07.770,0:00:10.889
favorites and who's likely to be a

0:00:09.240,0:00:12.690
middle contention for this yeah good

0:00:10.889,0:00:14.490
question to start with Bob welcome to

0:00:12.690,0:00:17.039
the Aquatic Centre this place is

0:00:14.490,0:00:19.830
electric with excitement the seats are

0:00:17.039,0:00:22.890
filling up and well it'd be safe to say

0:00:19.830,0:00:25.800
that the gold medal favorites buy quite

0:00:22.890,0:00:28.080
away are the Chinese women Shah and her

0:00:25.800,0:00:30.599
Zi about to wave to declare their the

0:00:28.080,0:00:32.430
Australians could feature and I think

0:00:30.599,0:00:35.309
the Canadians as well so I would say

0:00:32.430,0:00:37.020
China Canada Australia would be the

0:00:35.309,0:00:39.030
three frontrunners but anything can

0:00:37.020,0:00:41.040
happen it's a straight final every

0:00:39.030,0:00:43.829
single one of those five dives counts

0:00:41.040,0:00:45.930
and anything can happen and driving is

0:00:43.829,0:00:47.879
an evolving sport things change every

0:00:45.930,0:00:51.539
time we bring it to you whether at home

0:00:47.879,0:00:53.460
or around the world a new scoring system

0:00:51.539,0:00:55.350
of sorts anyway this time there are

0:00:53.460,0:00:57.270
twice the amount of execution judges how

0:00:55.350,0:00:58.800
will that work and why has it been

0:00:57.270,0:01:00.449
brought in yeah thanks for the question

0:00:58.800,0:01:02.940
on the judge in there for diving trying

0:01:00.449,0:01:04.799
to improve the scoring system to make it

0:01:02.940,0:01:07.040
even fairer you're going to see plenty

0:01:04.799,0:01:09.900
of scores coming up on the screen

0:01:07.040,0:01:11.640
execution judges and synchronized judges

0:01:09.900,0:01:13.799
so the execution judges are only looking

0:01:11.640,0:01:16.320
at the diver closest to them in the

0:01:13.799,0:01:17.970
execution they obviously split on both

0:01:16.320,0:01:20.189
sides of the pool and the synchro judges

0:01:17.970,0:01:22.020
are marking solely the synchronization

0:01:20.189,0:01:24.270
of the divers it goes through a little

0:01:22.020,0:01:25.680
bit of a complicated you know patterning

0:01:24.270,0:01:27.540
sequence you basically take the highest

0:01:25.680,0:01:29.640
and lowest off each of the execution

0:01:27.540,0:01:32.250
judges so two scores carry from

0:01:29.640,0:01:33.840
execution the five synchronized judges

0:01:32.250,0:01:36.299
the highest and lowest are taken off and

0:01:33.840,0:01:38.750
then the three synchronized scores are

0:01:36.299,0:01:41.070
then added to the to execution scores

0:01:38.750,0:01:44.040
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

0:01:41.070,0:01:46.530
you with me so far and then x naught

0:01:44.040,0:01:48.450
point six to give the total we can

0:01:46.530,0:01:50.509
explain again later but what you need to

0:01:48.450,0:01:52.700
know is it's weighted towards the

0:01:50.509,0:01:54.750
synchronization so the better the

0:01:52.700,0:01:56.909
synchronization you know the better it

0:01:54.750,0:01:58.740
is for the total score for that

0:01:56.909,0:02:00.960
particular dive of course every single

0:01:58.740,0:02:02.729
dive counts let's talk about the

0:02:00.960,0:02:04.290
selection of the divers as well so the

0:02:02.729,0:02:06.420
initial two rounds we'll see everybody

0:02:04.290,0:02:08.729
do the same ones maybe not in the same

0:02:06.420,0:02:10.800
order but it's the 2.0 so yeah that's

0:02:08.729,0:02:12.360
like the limited degree of difficulty so

0:02:10.800,0:02:13.980
the first two rounds as Bob said is a

0:02:12.360,0:02:15.810
fixed degree of difficulty of two

0:02:13.980,0:02:19.410
it doesn't matter what dive you do you

0:02:15.810,0:02:21.239
get a degree of difficulty of 2.0 so

0:02:19.410,0:02:24.030
you're gonna see forward dives reverse

0:02:21.239,0:02:26.580
dives inward dives very very simple

0:02:24.030,0:02:28.860
basic beautiful dives and they're all

0:02:26.580,0:02:30.840
important execution and synchronization

0:02:28.860,0:02:32.580
you will really see you know who's

0:02:30.840,0:02:34.260
touching their toes at the same time and

0:02:32.580,0:02:34.739
on the replays you'll really get to pull

0:02:34.260,0:02:37.170
it apart

0:02:34.739,0:02:39.090
of course the judges here do not see the

0:02:37.170,0:02:42.810
replay that is just for you at home to

0:02:39.090,0:02:44.489
enjoy also only one set of divers the

0:02:42.810,0:02:46.049
Australians are doing a three point one

0:02:44.489,0:02:47.700
the highest tariffs available to the

0:02:46.049,0:02:48.630
missing cut in this competition why

0:02:47.700,0:02:50.790
they're doing that and one of the

0:02:48.630,0:02:53.790
Chinese not doing that yeah women's

0:02:50.790,0:02:55.500
springboard diving it isn't like the

0:02:53.790,0:02:57.390
men's where the men's are really pushing

0:02:55.500,0:02:59.220
the boundaries three point six is three

0:02:57.390,0:03:01.230
point eight three point nine s the women

0:02:59.220,0:03:03.150
aren't quite strong enough to perform

0:03:01.230,0:03:05.610
those incredibly difficult dives but

0:03:03.150,0:03:07.860
what they are performing is Full Tilt

0:03:05.610,0:03:09.840
for the for the female diving population

0:03:07.860,0:03:11.040
and it's interesting to see the dive

0:03:09.840,0:03:12.030
that you're talking about that three

0:03:11.040,0:03:13.980
point one is the forward

0:03:12.030,0:03:16.349
three-and-a-half somersaults in the pike

0:03:13.980,0:03:17.640
position it's a it's a busy dive things

0:03:16.349,0:03:19.859
can go wrong and the Australians

0:03:17.640,0:03:22.470
obviously coming out all guns blazing

0:03:19.859,0:03:25.350
using that one as their second of their

0:03:22.470,0:03:27.569
three optional dives and Australians of

0:03:25.350,0:03:29.850
course number two in the start list but

0:03:27.569,0:03:33.109
the Chinese pair of women Sharon Percy

0:03:29.850,0:03:35.220
are super consistent super classy and

0:03:33.109,0:03:36.810
certainly they're going to be the the

0:03:35.220,0:03:38.400
frontrunners from the start I would

0:03:36.810,0:03:40.319
predict but then again we know what can

0:03:38.400,0:03:41.760
happen sometimes in Olympic diving and

0:03:40.319,0:03:43.530
we should point out the British pair

0:03:41.760,0:03:45.660
aren't here because they have qualified

0:03:43.530,0:03:47.730
they are here because of home nation

0:03:45.660,0:03:49.950
inclusion that's correct the

0:03:47.730,0:03:53.370
qualification event Rebecca gallantry

0:03:49.950,0:03:55.319
and Alyssia blag did not earn their spot

0:03:53.370,0:03:56.790
outright they've been given a spot

0:03:55.319,0:03:58.889
because we're a host nation so

0:03:56.790,0:04:01.290
predictions today for our girls anything

0:03:58.889,0:04:03.150
above 8th will be exceptional for

0:04:01.290,0:04:06.209
performance from from their point of

0:04:03.150,0:04:08.250
view so let's wait and see so the three

0:04:06.209,0:04:11.459
meter board is about to welcome its

0:04:08.250,0:04:14.359
first visitor two of them of course it

0:04:11.459,0:04:17.220
being sync rope tannier Kenyatta and

0:04:14.359,0:04:20.250
Francesca dalip a very experienced

0:04:17.220,0:04:22.289
pairing from Italy and when competition

0:04:20.250,0:04:25.530
gets underway very shortly they'll be

0:04:22.289,0:04:27.540
going for a Ford died with pike

0:04:25.530,0:04:30.570
you'll find the majority of the dives

0:04:27.540,0:04:33.270
today will be Pike educational tuck and

0:04:30.570,0:04:34.560
the occasional free dive where they

0:04:33.270,0:04:37.650
could pretty much do whatever they want

0:04:34.560,0:04:39.150
within reason yeah almost almost it's

0:04:37.650,0:04:40.740
not holding one position for too long so

0:04:39.150,0:04:42.450
the pike position of course is folding

0:04:40.740,0:04:45.870
at the hips and keeping the knees

0:04:42.450,0:04:48.630
straight and toes pointed the judges

0:04:45.870,0:04:52.140
looking for all important entries into

0:04:48.630,0:04:53.790
the water so the relatively simple or

0:04:52.140,0:04:56.310
straightforward dives coming first tenia

0:04:53.790,0:05:04.980
can the Otto and Francesca Donna pay for

0:04:56.310,0:05:07.890
Italy it's a solid start from the

0:05:04.980,0:05:10.650
Italian pair always tricky opening up a

0:05:07.890,0:05:12.419
contest the first divers and unlike the

0:05:10.650,0:05:14.430
world championships there's no

0:05:12.419,0:05:16.320
preliminaries to get rid of the EBG bees

0:05:14.430,0:05:19.470
but the Italian girls looking pretty

0:05:16.320,0:05:21.450
steadfast there as you can see maybe

0:05:19.470,0:05:23.730
Francesca closest to us hitting the

0:05:21.450,0:05:26.010
water a fraction ahead of Tonya corny

0:05:23.730,0:05:28.140
Otto but they'll be pleased with that

0:05:26.010,0:05:29.640
dive but looking at us maybe a little

0:05:28.140,0:05:31.800
bit of difference in the distance from

0:05:29.640,0:05:33.270
the board but I think the judges yep

0:05:31.800,0:05:34.890
that's a good start that's how the

0:05:33.270,0:05:37.680
judges see it the line through a number

0:05:34.890,0:05:42.690
means it doesn't count so the 9.0 on the

0:05:37.680,0:05:44.310
right and the 8.5 in the synchro do now

0:05:42.690,0:05:45.990
to the Australian pair the Australians

0:05:44.310,0:05:48.090
are doing well in the Aquatic Centre in

0:05:45.990,0:05:51.180
the pool so far can they replicate that

0:05:48.090,0:05:53.250
on the diving Hannibal Smith and

0:05:51.180,0:05:57.750
Charlene Stratton with their opening

0:05:53.250,0:06:00.229
dive this time it's a back dive for the

0:05:57.750,0:06:00.229
Australians

0:06:09.350,0:06:14.040
it's a good start for the Australian

0:06:11.580,0:06:16.890
pair you can hear Charlene err cueing

0:06:14.040,0:06:18.420
Annabel ready go and that's the magic if

0:06:16.890,0:06:21.450
synchronized diving we're not telepathic

0:06:18.420,0:06:23.640
if we do use counting or various signals

0:06:21.450,0:06:25.350
in order to take off and as you can see

0:06:23.640,0:06:28.080
here touching the toes at the same time

0:06:25.350,0:06:29.610
I'll move back towards the water you can

0:06:28.080,0:06:31.740
see the syncro for yourself please

0:06:29.610,0:06:33.810
remember the judges do not get to see

0:06:31.740,0:06:35.310
this the marks are already into the

0:06:33.810,0:06:36.360
computer and there be appearing on your

0:06:35.310,0:06:39.630
screen shortly

0:06:36.360,0:06:40.920
the Australian coaches they like it and

0:06:39.630,0:06:43.080
I'm sure the girls will please be

0:06:40.920,0:06:44.580
pleased with that start let's see what

0:06:43.080,0:06:46.890
it brings them brings them forty nine

0:06:44.580,0:06:48.480
point two zero the eight on the left and

0:06:46.890,0:06:51.390
the eight point five Zhan the right will

0:06:48.480,0:06:55.860
count towards their total now the

0:06:51.390,0:06:58.740
red-hot favourites will mix yep and Z

0:06:55.860,0:07:00.480
and they will start with of course 2.0

0:06:58.740,0:07:04.190
as all of these will be in the opening

0:07:00.480,0:07:04.190
two rounds it's a forward dive

0:07:07.170,0:07:13.090
just beautiful as we expect laying down

0:07:10.450,0:07:15.070
their markup limited degree of

0:07:13.090,0:07:18.250
difficulty so important that you're not

0:07:15.070,0:07:20.950
trying too hard and the judges awarding

0:07:18.250,0:07:22.570
the marks for graceful aesthetically

0:07:20.950,0:07:26.470
pleasing movements and as you can see

0:07:22.570,0:07:29.950
they're women shy and he's showing their

0:07:26.470,0:07:31.570
experience beautiful synchronization

0:07:29.950,0:07:33.910
hitting the water at the same time

0:07:31.570,0:07:36.520
littered with nines I'm sure from the

0:07:33.910,0:07:39.040
judges there we go yeah you're right in

0:07:36.520,0:07:40.480
the 9.5 thrown in for good measure so

0:07:39.040,0:07:42.970
that takes their total to the biggest

0:07:40.480,0:07:45.940
total so far fifty four point zero zero

0:07:42.970,0:07:48.460
I'm proud of which there's a pretty

0:07:45.940,0:07:50.860
decent number here at the Aquatic Center

0:07:48.460,0:07:54.460
welcome the British composers Alicia

0:07:50.860,0:07:57.780
black and Rebecca gallantry they will go

0:07:54.460,0:08:08.040
with the inward dive as a starting

0:07:57.780,0:08:10.780
program or good start there from the

0:08:08.040,0:08:12.850
that's certainly the home favorites the

0:08:10.780,0:08:15.400
crowd here we're really getting into it

0:08:12.850,0:08:17.830
a siliceous mum they're sporting the

0:08:15.400,0:08:19.180
Union Jack Rebecca just getting out the

0:08:17.830,0:08:21.729
pool there let's see how the girls did

0:08:19.180,0:08:23.800
it's actually very very good synchro

0:08:21.729,0:08:25.630
holding then Rebecca closest to us

0:08:23.800,0:08:27.940
hitting the water fractionally in front

0:08:25.630,0:08:30.070
of Alicia unless you of course only 15

0:08:27.940,0:08:31.630
imagine being in front of this crowd at

0:08:30.070,0:08:33.610
only 15 years old

0:08:31.630,0:08:35.620
super slow-motion you can see there

0:08:33.610,0:08:37.839
Rebecca just hitting the water a

0:08:35.620,0:08:39.580
fraction ahead as I said so the scores

0:08:37.839,0:08:41.469
will not be as good as the Chinese but

0:08:39.580,0:08:45.370
that's a solid start for the British

0:08:41.469,0:08:48.490
pair forty-nine point eight zero is

0:08:45.370,0:08:51.420
their opening score so they're the

0:08:48.490,0:08:55.180
bottom of the pile in the early stages

0:08:51.420,0:09:00.780
Abigail Johnston and Kelsey Bryant for

0:08:55.180,0:09:00.780
the USA for dive to start their five

0:09:03.769,0:09:08.730
well that's good from the US starting

0:09:06.930,0:09:10.800
their campaign plenty of support here

0:09:08.730,0:09:13.170
for the US I know they're rocking and

0:09:10.800,0:09:14.759
rolling in Nepal and this the dive team

0:09:13.170,0:09:16.459
probably aren't as strong as it where

0:09:14.759,0:09:18.660
anywhere near as strong as a swim team

0:09:16.459,0:09:20.610
opening up their campaign here with the

0:09:18.660,0:09:22.019
forward dive pikes walking to the end of

0:09:20.610,0:09:25.430
the diving board is called the hurdle

0:09:22.019,0:09:28.139
step in diving as you can see beautiful

0:09:25.430,0:09:29.430
synchronization I think the judges or to

0:09:28.139,0:09:33.089
mate in half sand nines for the

0:09:29.430,0:09:34.649
synchronization the US judges my coaches

0:09:33.089,0:09:37.199
sports in the same haircut there and

0:09:34.649,0:09:39.029
synchronized that's a great height on

0:09:37.199,0:09:40.800
that as well wasn't it they mostly get a

0:09:39.029,0:09:42.990
lot of elevation off the board fifty two

0:09:40.800,0:09:43.680
point eight zero the Americans open up

0:09:42.990,0:09:45.750
with that

0:09:43.680,0:09:48.000
here come the Canadians to follow

0:09:45.750,0:09:51.060
definitely middle prospects for today

0:09:48.000,0:09:53.430
it's a very tried and tested pair Emily

0:09:51.060,0:10:06.630
Haman's and Jennifer Abel with their

0:09:53.430,0:10:09.449
inward dive oh wow yes I'm pretty sure

0:10:06.630,0:10:11.610
the Canadians will be looking to get in

0:10:09.449,0:10:13.680
the first diving medal very strong team

0:10:11.610,0:10:15.209
and this is a strong eventful than any

0:10:13.680,0:10:17.339
Haven obviously in a fourth Olympic

0:10:15.209,0:10:20.579
Games medals in the previous three so a

0:10:17.339,0:10:23.100
wealth of Olympic experience Jenna fable

0:10:20.579,0:10:24.899
ten years younger than Emily and there

0:10:23.100,0:10:28.290
abouts and that's a nice start for the

0:10:24.899,0:10:30.060
Canadian pair good entries into the

0:10:28.290,0:10:31.350
water fantastic synchro that's going to

0:10:30.060,0:10:33.720
put them right up there close to the

0:10:31.350,0:10:35.850
Chinese I would imagine not too far shy

0:10:33.720,0:10:38.040
of the Chinese score fifty three point

0:10:35.850,0:10:39.930
four zero compared to fifty four for the

0:10:38.040,0:10:44.040
Chinese with their opening dive for

0:10:39.930,0:10:47.310
Canada puts him in second place handle a

0:10:44.040,0:10:49.079
pang and you're not young of Malaysia

0:10:47.310,0:10:51.680
with their opening dive which is a

0:10:49.079,0:10:51.680
forward dive

0:10:53.460,0:10:57.779
well well it ended up okay but I'm sure

0:10:56.190,0:10:59.670
you'll agree with me is a little bit of

0:10:57.779,0:11:01.140
a mismatch coming into the hurdle step

0:10:59.670,0:11:03.450
there it looked like they were going to

0:11:01.140,0:11:05.880
be well out of time but ended up hitting

0:11:03.450,0:11:09.000
the water you can see here differing

0:11:05.880,0:11:10.830
times on the on the jump they somehow

0:11:09.000,0:11:13.470
managed well you could just see the

0:11:10.830,0:11:15.510
synchronization ended up okay but wow

0:11:13.470,0:11:17.550
I'm not sure what to make of that let's

0:11:15.510,0:11:18.750
see what the judges think I don't know

0:11:17.550,0:11:21.060
what you think at home either

0:11:18.750,0:11:23.040
well here's their response and it's not

0:11:21.060,0:11:25.050
terribly pleasing for Malaysian eyes I'm

0:11:23.040,0:11:27.240
afraid forty six point two zero the

0:11:25.050,0:11:28.500
takeoff all over the place they finally

0:11:27.240,0:11:31.320
got together it wasn't the end to the

0:11:28.500,0:11:34.980
ball but not a great start for Malaysia

0:11:31.320,0:11:37.670
now the Ukraine represented by Anna his

0:11:34.980,0:11:39.779
men Scott and Elena Federer over and

0:11:37.670,0:11:41.430
again you've seen a couple of times

0:11:39.779,0:11:43.110
already here comes that inward dive if

0:11:41.430,0:11:45.120
you both do but of comparing and

0:11:43.110,0:11:46.620
contrasting in the opening couple of

0:11:45.120,0:11:55.589
rounds as everybody does the same kind

0:11:46.620,0:11:57.390
of diving getting into the competition

0:11:55.589,0:11:59.130
now I would say that judges are looking

0:11:57.390,0:12:02.400
for the divers to be completely in line

0:11:59.130,0:12:03.779
and I'm sure the replay will show that

0:12:02.400,0:12:05.400
one of the divers was slightly further

0:12:03.779,0:12:10.290
away from the diving pool so they will

0:12:05.400,0:12:11.670
be penalized yeah I am correct the

0:12:10.290,0:12:13.920
churches of course don't get the benefit

0:12:11.670,0:12:15.690
of the replay but we do and you do and

0:12:13.920,0:12:17.190
so they're probably be middle of the

0:12:15.690,0:12:18.720
pack with that one maybe towards the

0:12:17.190,0:12:21.720
bottom certainly even bit better than

0:12:18.720,0:12:24.839
the Malaysians effort Hickam the scores

0:12:21.720,0:12:26.070
a point fives on the right will count in

0:12:24.839,0:12:28.529
the eight on the Left will count the

0:12:26.070,0:12:31.020
ones with the lines through do not so a

0:12:28.529,0:12:35.370
total of forty nine point two zero for

0:12:31.020,0:12:36.770
Ukraine end of the first round of the

0:12:35.370,0:12:39.900
women's synchronized 3-meter springboard

0:12:36.770,0:12:42.270
China no surprise in first place can day

0:12:39.900,0:12:44.990
USA Great Britain in fifth with forty

0:12:42.270,0:12:44.990
nine point eight zero

0:12:47.690,0:12:51.989
[Music]

0:12:55.070,0:12:58.229
[Music]

0:13:00.560,0:13:04.380
[Applause]

0:13:01.040,0:13:04.380
[Music]

0:13:04.550,0:13:09.540
on to round 2 of the women's

0:13:07.170,0:13:14.940
synchronized 3-meter springboard first

0:13:09.540,0:13:16.920
diving event at London 2012 and starting

0:13:14.940,0:13:18.450
the turns made a decent job of in the

0:13:16.920,0:13:21.450
first round but their forward dive here

0:13:18.450,0:13:31.500
comes the reverse dive of Tanya Kenyatta

0:13:21.450,0:13:33.540
and Francesca dalip a classy dive there

0:13:31.500,0:13:35.100
from the Italian pair and they're

0:13:33.540,0:13:38.060
certainly going to be in the hunt for a

0:13:35.100,0:13:39.990
medal here if a wealth of experience

0:13:38.060,0:13:42.150
looking to be nice to stage you see

0:13:39.990,0:13:43.920
Francesca closest to her toes hanging 10

0:13:42.150,0:13:46.080
as we call it all 10 toes over the end

0:13:43.920,0:13:48.600
of the diving board but she manages to

0:13:46.080,0:13:51.090
hold the execution who died beautifully

0:13:48.600,0:13:53.640
Connie otters father of course competed

0:13:51.090,0:13:55.440
40 years ago and won a medal in the

0:13:53.640,0:13:56.910
springboard event so certainly following

0:13:55.440,0:13:59.490
the family tradition and those are the

0:13:56.910,0:14:01.680
marks for the Italians nines and a point

0:13:59.490,0:14:04.800
fives and eight point five Zhan the left

0:14:01.680,0:14:07.440
in terms of execution we'll go through

0:14:04.800,0:14:09.090
the rigmarole of how they get to that

0:14:07.440,0:14:12.420
final score a little later on again in

0:14:09.090,0:14:14.520
case you missed the early part of it now

0:14:12.420,0:14:18.810
the Australians who have high hopes of a

0:14:14.520,0:14:23.400
medal SiC from near the bottom it comes

0:14:18.810,0:14:25.170
their reverse dive well it's a better

0:14:23.400,0:14:28.110
second round I've from a synchronization

0:14:25.170,0:14:29.520
point of view however the execution well

0:14:28.110,0:14:31.380
the all-important entry into the water

0:14:29.520,0:14:34.020
throwing up a little bit too much splash

0:14:31.380,0:14:35.490
there so the execution judges will

0:14:34.020,0:14:38.160
penalize for that but look at this

0:14:35.490,0:14:40.170
beautiful synchronization arms moving at

0:14:38.160,0:14:42.030
the same time correct distance from the

0:14:40.170,0:14:44.460
diving board all alignments in their

0:14:42.030,0:14:46.260
correct alignment there we are the super

0:14:44.460,0:14:48.270
slow-motion drop cam you can see the

0:14:46.260,0:14:50.100
divers entering the water they're trying

0:14:48.270,0:14:51.450
to spread the air that they're taking

0:14:50.100,0:14:55.170
down with them with the hands in order

0:14:51.450,0:14:57.150
to complete get the suction didn't quite

0:14:55.170,0:14:59.910
work for the Aussies oh no the execution

0:14:57.150,0:15:03.570
judges are fairly split on that score of

0:14:59.910,0:15:05.010
40 9.20 exactly the same as they scored

0:15:03.570,0:15:08.390
in the first round

0:15:05.010,0:15:12.070
Chyna leading the way this is the

0:15:08.390,0:15:15.730
reverse sorts with one

0:15:12.070,0:15:17.650
twists first we reverse one-and-a-half

0:15:15.730,0:15:19.300
somersaults half a twist of course the

0:15:17.650,0:15:20.950
limited degree of difficulty there

0:15:19.300,0:15:22.060
Chinese interesting choice of dive

0:15:20.950,0:15:24.040
actually it's a little bit more

0:15:22.060,0:15:25.390
complicated than some of the others

0:15:24.040,0:15:27.700
we've been seeing but of course the

0:15:25.390,0:15:29.590
degree of difficulty is fixed at 2.0

0:15:27.700,0:15:31.990
landing on the end of the diving board

0:15:29.590,0:15:33.340
here's the half a twist and there's the

0:15:31.990,0:15:35.110
one and a half so it's not the best

0:15:33.340,0:15:38.470
synchronization I've seen from this

0:15:35.110,0:15:40.630
Chinese pair that means it gives the

0:15:38.470,0:15:42.550
other pairs chance to stay with them of

0:15:40.630,0:15:44.710
course all changes will happen from vine

0:15:42.550,0:15:46.960
3 when their unlimited degree of

0:15:44.710,0:15:48.700
difficulty vines kick in well it's still

0:15:46.960,0:15:50.110
good marks but maybe not quite as good

0:15:48.700,0:15:51.850
as they would have hoped for fifty two

0:15:50.110,0:15:54.610
point eight zero does open the door

0:15:51.850,0:15:57.310
slightly there's ajar anyway for the

0:15:54.610,0:16:00.130
rest to follow become the home favorites

0:15:57.310,0:16:02.650
at least here black and Rebecca Gallen

0:16:00.130,0:16:04.780
treat looking for the expensive one just

0:16:02.650,0:16:10.560
say well I say straight forward forward

0:16:04.780,0:16:12.790
dive for the British pair or very good

0:16:10.560,0:16:14.440
synchronization it was good entries into

0:16:12.790,0:16:17.710
the water I think Rebecca Gallen tree

0:16:14.440,0:16:18.940
closest to us just bends at the hips as

0:16:17.710,0:16:20.890
she enters the water giving the

0:16:18.940,0:16:23.290
impression she wasn't vertical which was

0:16:20.890,0:16:25.000
a shame because actually until their

0:16:23.290,0:16:26.650
hands touched the water this had nines

0:16:25.000,0:16:27.790
written all over it I'm not sure what

0:16:26.650,0:16:30.400
the judges are going to go for

0:16:27.790,0:16:31.810
synchronization is fantastic hopefully

0:16:30.400,0:16:34.870
they're going to go certainly in my

0:16:31.810,0:16:36.910
opinion deserves some nines i loving

0:16:34.870,0:16:38.800
their costumes fantastic design all

0:16:36.910,0:16:41.350
about impressing the judges and that's a

0:16:38.800,0:16:43.750
great second round dive as it is they've

0:16:41.350,0:16:46.330
stepped it up a notch or two lines on

0:16:43.750,0:16:47.890
the right hand side total of fifty two

0:16:46.330,0:16:48.280
point two zero for the time being at

0:16:47.890,0:16:52.000
least

0:16:48.280,0:16:55.450
they're up into third place the

0:16:52.000,0:16:58.120
americans abigail johnston and you'll

0:16:55.450,0:17:01.230
see bryant and they will go for a

0:16:58.120,0:17:04.230
reverse dive again all these tariffs of

0:17:01.230,0:17:04.230
2.0

0:17:07.250,0:17:12.360
and I've been impressed we're watching

0:17:09.300,0:17:13.829
these girls in training and they're

0:17:12.360,0:17:15.750
certainly holding the kind of form that

0:17:13.829,0:17:17.730
they were showing in practice has Nick

0:17:15.750,0:17:19.470
McCrory cheering them on from the

0:17:17.730,0:17:22.079
sidelines great support for these divers

0:17:19.470,0:17:24.390
here today all about holding your nerve

0:17:22.079,0:17:26.910
this is a precision sport it's all about

0:17:24.390,0:17:28.050
consistency and the Americans certainly

0:17:26.910,0:17:30.030
coming out with a bit of consistency

0:17:28.050,0:17:32.910
some funny arm movements there but there

0:17:30.030,0:17:34.620
we go up over the top beautiful overhead

0:17:32.910,0:17:37.230
shot there I think they're going to get

0:17:34.620,0:17:39.809
some nines for that one they do they

0:17:37.230,0:17:41.820
match the British core nines in synchro

0:17:39.809,0:17:47.059
and eight point five and eight in

0:17:41.820,0:17:49.679
execution Americans go into second place

0:17:47.059,0:17:53.429
on to the Canadians following the

0:17:49.679,0:17:56.730
Americans with a forward dive second

0:17:53.429,0:18:00.170
after round one this is Emily Haman's

0:17:56.730,0:18:00.170
and Jennifer Abel

0:18:05.559,0:18:09.830
well it wasn't sure what was going on

0:18:08.000,0:18:12.380
there Bob Bob well are just looking over

0:18:09.830,0:18:14.150
to me quizzically and yes I'm not quite

0:18:12.380,0:18:16.580
sure how they were approaching the end

0:18:14.150,0:18:19.100
of the diving port there from here it's

0:18:16.580,0:18:21.679
okay so we can see on the replay arms up

0:18:19.100,0:18:23.690
into the pike shape marginally out of

0:18:21.679,0:18:24.890
time in and out of the pike shape entry

0:18:23.690,0:18:26.510
into the water is actually good

0:18:24.890,0:18:28.190
alignment just as his from the diving

0:18:26.510,0:18:30.200
board and hitting the water

0:18:28.190,0:18:31.909
jennipher they're moving very close

0:18:30.200,0:18:33.679
towards Emily trying to hold hands on

0:18:31.909,0:18:35.750
the way down oh my goodness look she was

0:18:33.679,0:18:37.820
right in the corner well done Jennifer

0:18:35.750,0:18:39.500
you did well there to hold that my

0:18:37.820,0:18:41.390
goodness that could have been much worse

0:18:39.500,0:18:43.190
than it was the Canadians still in it I

0:18:41.390,0:18:44.720
think can I call that a scruffy dive

0:18:43.190,0:18:46.730
there was nothing nice or

0:18:44.720,0:18:48.289
edifying about that die from the start

0:18:46.730,0:18:51.919
to the end was there it just didn't look

0:18:48.289,0:18:53.870
great at any stage and they were

0:18:51.919,0:18:57.080
punished for that fifty seven point four

0:18:53.870,0:19:00.830
zero the marks are down is Pam and she

0:18:57.080,0:19:02.270
on for Malaysia oh the chamois in the

0:19:00.830,0:19:03.860
water there that certainly drought dried

0:19:02.270,0:19:05.840
my attention obviously been thrown in by

0:19:03.860,0:19:07.640
one of the divers that's what the divers

0:19:05.840,0:19:09.559
used to try themselves off in between

0:19:07.640,0:19:11.059
rounds to make sure they don't slip when

0:19:09.559,0:19:12.500
they're in the shape so here we are this

0:19:11.059,0:19:14.090
is the back one-and-a-half somersaults

0:19:12.500,0:19:16.669
with the half a twist there's the half a

0:19:14.090,0:19:19.070
twist into the pike position or the free

0:19:16.669,0:19:20.510
position the Malaysians are probably a

0:19:19.070,0:19:22.370
little bit off the pace now wouldn't be

0:19:20.510,0:19:23.720
surprised if if they're towards the

0:19:22.370,0:19:27.830
bottom of the field at the end of this

0:19:23.720,0:19:29.210
contest but still a long way to go look

0:19:27.830,0:19:31.460
back at the scoreboard they'll see what

0:19:29.210,0:19:34.940
you're seeing on your screen eight the

0:19:31.460,0:19:36.919
left 8.0 s and 7.5 s will count on the

0:19:34.940,0:19:39.440
right yeah a shake of the head two going

0:19:36.919,0:19:41.419
not quite how we planned that to go and

0:19:39.440,0:19:43.700
how it went in training now these girls

0:19:41.419,0:19:45.710
need a bit of pickup as well cements get

0:19:43.700,0:19:50.750
and a fella over of Ukraine

0:19:45.710,0:19:52.309
oh it's reasonably okay you know again

0:19:50.750,0:19:53.390
the approach on the hurdle step that's

0:19:52.309,0:19:54.620
what we call the hurdle steps as they

0:19:53.390,0:19:56.440
come into the end of the diving board

0:19:54.620,0:19:58.490
seem to be a little bit ahead of time

0:19:56.440,0:19:59.840
managed to get it together in the end

0:19:58.490,0:20:01.159
the judges are inputting the scores as

0:19:59.840,0:20:03.710
we speak and let's look at the replay

0:20:01.159,0:20:05.270
yeah a little bit of overbalancing

0:20:03.710,0:20:07.520
coming into their dive you're closest to

0:20:05.270,0:20:09.770
us you can see both divers it needs to

0:20:07.520,0:20:12.409
be a mirror image so there I think only

0:20:09.770,0:20:14.149
eights for synchro maybe even a seven

0:20:12.409,0:20:15.380
and a half I'm not sure that's what you

0:20:14.149,0:20:16.730
see what the judges think

0:20:15.380,0:20:18.110
right there be

0:20:16.730,0:20:19.760
the bottom in the field I think after

0:20:18.110,0:20:22.040
the first two rounds our happy faces

0:20:19.760,0:20:24.260
they're his men Scott and feller over

0:20:22.040,0:20:26.840
eights will not cut it today they need

0:20:24.260,0:20:30.200
to be far higher up the food chain than

0:20:26.840,0:20:32.240
that China USA Italy after round two

0:20:30.200,0:20:35.000
Great Britain in fourth place just ahead

0:20:32.240,0:20:37.280
of Canada bringing up the rain on into a

0:20:35.000,0:20:38.750
hundred marks yet Australia surprisingly

0:20:37.280,0:20:39.799
a long way down at this stage where

0:20:38.750,0:20:42.890
there are three more rounds to come

0:20:39.799,0:20:54.500
Ukraine and Malaysia at the back of the

0:20:42.890,0:20:58.370
pack now the dives getting a bit more

0:20:54.500,0:21:01.040
difficult as we get to the 2.0 so up to

0:20:58.370,0:21:04.549
three point zeroes back two and a half

0:21:01.040,0:21:07.030
somersaults the third round dive of the

0:21:04.549,0:21:10.309
Italian pair of Tanya can you tow and

0:21:07.030,0:21:13.840
Francesca de la Paix it'll be performed

0:21:10.309,0:21:13.840
in the pike position

0:21:28.269,0:21:34.220
Wow this is where the competition starts

0:21:31.070,0:21:36.529
that's a fantastic opening optional dive

0:21:34.220,0:21:38.179
we've got the required out the way the

0:21:36.529,0:21:40.309
limited degree of difficulty this is

0:21:38.179,0:21:42.529
where the big guns come out and in the

0:21:40.309,0:21:47.330
female springboard event that means the

0:21:42.529,0:21:48.980
back two and a half pikes 3.0 beautiful

0:21:47.330,0:21:50.840
entry into the water finishing a little

0:21:48.980,0:21:52.879
bit low than you lower than you would

0:21:50.840,0:21:54.590
hope a little bit art-sheet both of them

0:21:52.879,0:21:56.450
doing a good impression of a banana

0:21:54.590,0:21:59.330
however the entry into the water is good

0:21:56.450,0:22:02.119
the syncro will be 8.5 s yes Wow there

0:21:59.330,0:22:04.879
you go marker down seven four point

0:22:02.119,0:22:06.649
seven zero it is for the Italian pair

0:22:04.879,0:22:07.940
that all lifts their spirits and lifts

0:22:06.649,0:22:09.980
them up the table just a little bit

0:22:07.940,0:22:11.779
after that but here come the Australians

0:22:09.980,0:22:14.690
they have their big dive to come in

0:22:11.779,0:22:18.970
round for the third round dive is an

0:22:14.690,0:22:18.970
inward two and a half somersaults

0:22:36.070,0:22:40.460
well the Aussies have got some work to

0:22:38.210,0:22:42.530
do and that probably won't help the

0:22:40.460,0:22:45.050
Inwood two and a half of course standing

0:22:42.530,0:22:47.570
backwards but having to spin forwards

0:22:45.050,0:22:49.250
towards the diving board it's dangerous

0:22:47.570,0:22:50.690
because your toes especially in the pike

0:22:49.250,0:22:52.040
position could come a little bit close

0:22:50.690,0:22:54.260
but I'm pleased to say both divers

0:22:52.040,0:22:56.150
clearing the diving board Charlene

0:22:54.260,0:22:57.620
Stratton closest to us going over a

0:22:56.150,0:22:59.660
vertical as she goes in the

0:22:57.620,0:23:01.340
synchronization is very very good I

0:22:59.660,0:23:03.470
don't think they get more than eights in

0:23:01.340,0:23:05.990
synchro and they need to do better than

0:23:03.470,0:23:08.120
that to catch the front runners yeah

0:23:05.990,0:23:12.050
eights for Cinco it is but the execution

0:23:08.120,0:23:16.610
letting them down 7.5 will count on the

0:23:12.050,0:23:20.420
left-hand side now on to the favorites

0:23:16.610,0:23:22.850
of course we have a diver in were going

0:23:20.420,0:23:26.780
for her third title in this event it is

0:23:22.850,0:23:30.260
Wu paired with her Zi this time and they

0:23:26.780,0:23:36.050
are going for inwards two-and-a-half

0:23:30.260,0:23:37.190
somersaults well there you go China just

0:23:36.050,0:23:40.220
showing their dominance

0:23:37.190,0:23:41.890
the first option all around dive and I

0:23:40.220,0:23:45.380
put a flag waving from their teammates

0:23:41.890,0:23:47.840
the replay or just show how good this

0:23:45.380,0:23:49.370
pairing is China's so strong in this

0:23:47.840,0:23:51.920
sport in which two and a half there we

0:23:49.370,0:23:54.740
go both divers finishing way above board

0:23:51.920,0:23:58.190
level plenty of time to complete the

0:23:54.740,0:24:00.140
dive almost effortlessly entries into

0:23:58.190,0:24:04.250
the water very very good good execution

0:24:00.140,0:24:08.809
nines for synchro yep there we go mystic

0:24:04.250,0:24:12.710
Leon strikes again 9.0 9.0 and 8.5 on

0:24:08.809,0:24:16.070
the execution the cheer greets the home

0:24:12.710,0:24:18.920
favorites first they're really big dive

0:24:16.070,0:24:21.770
see it for Alicia black and Rebekah

0:24:18.920,0:24:23.750
gallantry it's a reverse two and a half

0:24:21.770,0:24:26.830
somersaults was worth three point zero

0:24:23.750,0:24:26.830
in tariffs now

0:24:28.670,0:24:33.650
oh it was always the risky one if there

0:24:31.190,0:24:35.450
was a dive in their program which might

0:24:33.650,0:24:37.430
might let them down it was going to be

0:24:35.450,0:24:38.960
this one it's the reverse two and a half

0:24:37.430,0:24:41.270
which means landing on any end of the

0:24:38.960,0:24:43.100
diving board jumping up and away from

0:24:41.270,0:24:45.380
the diving board and spinning backwards

0:24:43.100,0:24:47.300
towards it the girls were in beautiful

0:24:45.380,0:24:48.890
sinker there Becky just letting go have

0:24:47.300,0:24:51.710
a shake just a little bit too early

0:24:48.890,0:24:53.330
landing shorter vertical with a bit of a

0:24:51.710,0:24:56.000
back arch it's a shame because the

0:24:53.330,0:24:58.370
synchronization is good Tom Daly they're

0:24:56.000,0:25:00.170
just showing you with his expression

0:24:58.370,0:25:02.810
what I'm telling you with my words and

0:25:00.170,0:25:05.270
the marks will indicate exactly all of

0:25:02.810,0:25:07.310
the above and all her before the

0:25:05.270,0:25:09.560
execution not great the sink are not

0:25:07.310,0:25:11.630
great ultimately it puts him down a

0:25:09.560,0:25:15.010
couple of places and actually might mean

0:25:11.630,0:25:17.540
them dropping to the bottom of the table

0:25:15.010,0:25:20.450
now on to the Americans Johnston and

0:25:17.540,0:25:23.540
Bryant going for a for two and a half

0:25:20.450,0:25:31.040
somersaults this will have one twist

0:25:23.540,0:25:33.320
involved in it as well there we go very

0:25:31.040,0:25:34.820
good from the American says certainly

0:25:33.320,0:25:37.280
going to be in the hunt if they carry on

0:25:34.820,0:25:38.600
with this consistent performance I was

0:25:37.280,0:25:41.990
watching him in training and I've been

0:25:38.600,0:25:43.490
very impressed smiles or veins here we

0:25:41.990,0:25:45.230
go forward two and a half somersaults

0:25:43.490,0:25:47.000
one twist so here's one and a half

0:25:45.230,0:25:48.650
somersaults there's one twist and

0:25:47.000,0:25:50.990
there's the completion of the two and a

0:25:48.650,0:25:52.880
half the synchronization is very good I

0:25:50.990,0:25:54.740
think they're going to get 88.5 s on the

0:25:52.880,0:25:56.390
synchro and that's going to leave them

0:25:54.740,0:25:59.030
in good stead well up there with the

0:25:56.390,0:26:01.220
frontrunners up above the Italians and

0:25:59.030,0:26:05.590
the Australians and into second place go

0:26:01.220,0:26:05.590
Abigail Johnson and Kelsey Bryant now

0:26:07.600,0:26:13.970
the Canadian Pet of Emily havens and

0:26:11.540,0:26:16.370
Jennifer Abel first of their really big

0:26:13.970,0:26:19.970
dives and is the back two and a half

0:26:16.370,0:26:21.740
somersaults fifth place after round two

0:26:19.970,0:26:23.750
but this can change very very quickly

0:26:21.740,0:26:27.520
and rapidly and we get up to the bigger

0:26:23.750,0:26:30.880
tariff and here comes the first of this

0:26:27.520,0:26:33.170
well it's good Jennifer April absolutely

0:26:30.880,0:26:36.050
nailed her back two and a half pike

0:26:33.170,0:26:38.270
Emily was good as well let's have a look

0:26:36.050,0:26:40.280
on the replay I was distracted by the

0:26:38.270,0:26:42.740
execution of Jennifer that was truly

0:26:40.280,0:26:44.090
exceptional synchronizations a little

0:26:42.740,0:26:45.950
bit off you can see there in the pike

0:26:44.090,0:26:48.230
spinning at different signs entering the

0:26:45.950,0:26:49.970
water okay so I think the judges might

0:26:48.230,0:26:51.770
go with them on that I think they might

0:26:49.970,0:26:54.290
get seven house and eights for syncro

0:26:51.770,0:26:55.760
which is a good citko score execution

0:26:54.290,0:26:57.950
might vary though let's have a look

0:26:55.760,0:27:00.710
eights on the syncro eight point five

0:26:57.950,0:27:03.320
and eight on the execution for Haman's

0:27:00.710,0:27:08.590
and abel and they're not able yet to get

0:27:03.320,0:27:11.260
into the top three on to the Malaysians

0:27:08.590,0:27:14.270
have their race run for their early

0:27:11.260,0:27:15.620
dives but there's three more to come so

0:27:14.270,0:27:17.690
perhaps they can pick things up a bit

0:27:15.620,0:27:20.120
here with their back two and a half

0:27:17.690,0:27:20.990
somersaults in the pike position relays

0:27:20.120,0:27:24.610
you at the moment

0:27:20.990,0:27:24.610
in the last place

0:27:27.710,0:27:31.520
or that isn't going to help them yeah

0:27:29.810,0:27:34.490
you can see entries into the water

0:27:31.520,0:27:37.880
they're both divers over rotating so

0:27:34.490,0:27:39.230
you'll see that is on the replay hitting

0:27:37.880,0:27:40.580
the water vertically it's obviously what

0:27:39.230,0:27:42.140
the judges are looking for and what the

0:27:40.580,0:27:44.930
divers would have been hoping for but as

0:27:42.140,0:27:47.090
you see here both over rotating so tops

0:27:44.930,0:27:50.090
of the thighs and then shins hitting the

0:27:47.090,0:27:51.890
water even a little bit of a mini tidal

0:27:50.090,0:27:53.540
wave being set off they're not quite

0:27:51.890,0:27:56.960
enough to get your surfboard tight but

0:27:53.540,0:27:58.730
there we go Malaysia quite far behind

0:27:56.960,0:28:00.530
now I would imagine when the marks come

0:27:58.730,0:28:03.680
up never really got going today have

0:28:00.530,0:28:06.380
they and those scores are for sore eyes

0:28:03.680,0:28:07.790
I'm afraid if you happen the 5.5 so

0:28:06.380,0:28:12.800
you're not really in contention and

0:28:07.790,0:28:16.220
they're not Ukraine where the Bissman

0:28:12.800,0:28:17.780
skip and the fed a robot this is their

0:28:16.220,0:28:20.240
back two and a half somersaults and

0:28:17.780,0:28:22.610
again the further back when they'd like

0:28:20.240,0:28:29.750
to be after round two they're in seventh

0:28:22.610,0:28:31.730
place oh it's pretty solid nothing

0:28:29.750,0:28:34.040
spectacular but that will certainly keep

0:28:31.730,0:28:38.050
them where they were after the first two

0:28:34.040,0:28:38.050
rounds maybe move them up a place or two

0:28:38.110,0:28:42.350
swinging the arms bending the knees

0:28:40.190,0:28:44.150
reaching up looking for enough elevation

0:28:42.350,0:28:45.500
to squeeze into this backward two and a

0:28:44.150,0:28:47.420
half obviously spinning backwards away

0:28:45.500,0:28:49.280
from the diving board a little bit of

0:28:47.420,0:28:51.250
splash being thrown up from both divers

0:28:49.280,0:28:55.640
they're probably six and a half's on the

0:28:51.250,0:28:57.590
execution 7.5 synchro let's see well I

0:28:55.640,0:29:00.440
think those marks will be generous to my

0:28:57.590,0:29:01.970
eyes for the you know 7.5 s + 6 and 6.5

0:29:00.440,0:29:04.070
doesn't really doing a great deal of

0:29:01.970,0:29:08.210
good in terms of moving up in positions

0:29:04.070,0:29:13.010
they are sick they were seventh not

0:29:08.210,0:29:15.740
really in medal contention so we are 3/5

0:29:13.010,0:29:16.940
gone China as I have done all the way

0:29:15.740,0:29:20.870
through the competition of leading

0:29:16.940,0:29:23.660
that's changing behind them USA to Italy

0:29:20.870,0:29:25.190
3 Canada 4 and Great Britain's change

0:29:23.660,0:29:30.280
might have faltered somewhat with that

0:29:25.190,0:29:30.280
round 3 dive from black and gallantry

0:29:31.080,0:29:34.200
[Music]

0:29:39.590,0:29:44.760
so on to the penultimate round of dives

0:29:42.480,0:29:47.520
in the women's synchronized 3-meter

0:29:44.760,0:29:51.000
springboard the Italians are Kenyatta

0:29:47.520,0:29:52.580
and dalla pate and with a forward two

0:29:51.000,0:29:58.590
and a half somersaults with one twist

0:29:52.580,0:29:59.820
their last but one attempt always ended

0:29:58.590,0:30:02.100
up okay in the end

0:29:59.820,0:30:03.450
they normally finish on this dive

0:30:02.100,0:30:05.610
obviously been having a little bit of

0:30:03.450,0:30:06.810
difficulty in training electing to to

0:30:05.610,0:30:09.300
put in their program a little bit

0:30:06.810,0:30:10.740
earlier let's see what happens so

0:30:09.300,0:30:12.510
landing on the end of the diving board

0:30:10.740,0:30:13.650
cono furthest away from us was a little

0:30:12.510,0:30:15.120
bit back from the end there's not very

0:30:13.650,0:30:17.340
much spring there and as you can see

0:30:15.120,0:30:20.160
she's struggling a little bit to get a

0:30:17.340,0:30:22.830
dive in in the allotted time so there's

0:30:20.160,0:30:24.810
the twist into the water it's a little

0:30:22.830,0:30:26.400
bit here and there but I still think

0:30:24.810,0:30:27.660
that will keep them in contention well

0:30:26.400,0:30:29.580
show you how the sync remarks which

0:30:27.660,0:30:32.400
you're gonna be the telling scorer here

0:30:29.580,0:30:34.350
seven point five seven and seven in

0:30:32.400,0:30:37.500
terms of a medal prospect that might be

0:30:34.350,0:30:40.110
the end of it that was not very well

0:30:37.500,0:30:42.690
executed the Australians also have a bit

0:30:40.110,0:30:44.130
of work to do Smith and Stratton they

0:30:42.690,0:30:46.200
could start by doing it with the biggest

0:30:44.130,0:30:48.470
dive of the competition there's a

0:30:46.200,0:30:51.450
forward three and a half somersaults

0:30:48.470,0:30:53.400
Pike position it is worth three point

0:30:51.450,0:30:56.060
one biggest tariff we will see in the

0:30:53.400,0:30:56.060
competition today

0:30:57.040,0:31:02.680
or high risk from the Australians the

0:30:59.440,0:31:04.720
synchronization was superb the execution

0:31:02.680,0:31:06.340
and this is why it's worth three point

0:31:04.720,0:31:07.930
one was a little bit off Charlene

0:31:06.340,0:31:10.570
closest to us they're getting out the

0:31:07.930,0:31:12.820
water actually lands short of vertical

0:31:10.570,0:31:15.970
so here we go let's count them one two

0:31:12.820,0:31:17.620
three Sharlee yes sure to vertical

0:31:15.970,0:31:19.350
they're squeezing it round I think

0:31:17.620,0:31:21.580
she'll get penalized a little bit their

0:31:19.350,0:31:23.620
synchronization was good three point one

0:31:21.580,0:31:25.420
didi look at this super slow-motion look

0:31:23.620,0:31:29.460
at the expression on the divers faces

0:31:25.420,0:31:32.650
this is a tough sport good scores though

0:31:29.460,0:31:34.900
sixty nine point seven five eight on the

0:31:32.650,0:31:36.310
right seven and six point five on the

0:31:34.900,0:31:38.680
left for the time being anyway they're

0:31:36.310,0:31:43.630
up to second be there for very long with

0:31:38.680,0:31:47.320
these two around though woo and it's yep

0:31:43.630,0:31:50.010
how's he going for their fourth dive

0:31:47.320,0:31:52.300
reverse two and a half somersaults

0:31:50.010,0:31:55.990
there you go pick the bones out of that

0:31:52.300,0:31:57.910
one my goodness me the italians opening

0:31:55.990,0:31:59.740
the door slightly for them they were the

0:31:57.910,0:32:00.820
closest ones to the Chinese and the

0:31:59.740,0:32:03.280
Chinese just showing that they are

0:32:00.820,0:32:04.870
really a cut above landing on the end of

0:32:03.280,0:32:06.700
the diving board here perfect unison

0:32:04.870,0:32:08.710
here it comes to reverse two and a half

0:32:06.700,0:32:10.510
in the pike position that's got nines

0:32:08.710,0:32:13.030
written all over it for me that could

0:32:10.510,0:32:14.530
potentially go close to 80 points let's

0:32:13.030,0:32:17.110
wait and see what the judges think but

0:32:14.530,0:32:18.940
for me that's the dive of the contest of

0:32:17.110,0:32:21.280
thus far and see too much wrong with

0:32:18.940,0:32:23.280
that could you nines on the right nine

0:32:21.280,0:32:26.020
and 8.5 on the left

0:32:23.280,0:32:28.030
execution judge is not overly enamored

0:32:26.020,0:32:28.330
with it but synchro judges loved it to

0:32:28.030,0:32:31.960
bits

0:32:28.330,0:32:34.350
that's why China have a sizable lead 23

0:32:31.960,0:32:37.780
points over the Italians at this stage

0:32:34.350,0:32:40.660
now to the Brits back in gallantry for

0:32:37.780,0:32:44.340
two and a half somersaults one twist can

0:32:40.660,0:32:44.340
they make up a position or two with this

0:32:45.830,0:32:49.759
yes I think they can is the answer to

0:32:47.960,0:32:52.549
your question Bob that's an excellent

0:32:49.759,0:32:54.590
fourth round I've obviously crossed with

0:32:52.549,0:32:56.809
themselves for the third round I've came

0:32:54.590,0:32:58.460
out kept their composure and here we are

0:32:56.809,0:33:00.590
this is a big die for them forward two

0:32:58.460,0:33:01.730
and a half somersaults one twist and one

0:33:00.590,0:33:04.369
and a half somersaults and there's the

0:33:01.730,0:33:05.720
twist good synchronization Rebecca maybe

0:33:04.369,0:33:09.619
a little bit further away from the

0:33:05.720,0:33:11.389
diving board then licit so yep I'm

0:33:09.619,0:33:13.909
liking it let's see the judges think I

0:33:11.389,0:33:15.980
think eights on synchro should be in the

0:33:13.909,0:33:18.529
bag for them which is much more like it

0:33:15.980,0:33:21.259
the crowd obviously getting well behind

0:33:18.529,0:33:23.869
them I wanna talent and Lycia brag will

0:33:21.259,0:33:26.450
be in due course certainly early stage

0:33:23.869,0:33:28.129
of a diving development here and they'll

0:33:26.450,0:33:31.940
be happy enough with that just give them

0:33:28.129,0:33:35.509
a nice solid score of 72 now the USA

0:33:31.940,0:33:37.220
degree of difficulty again 3.0 inward

0:33:35.509,0:33:43.119
two-and-a-half somersaults for the

0:33:37.220,0:33:43.119
Americans currently just in second place

0:33:46.659,0:33:51.559
Wow they've rocking it today now I

0:33:49.429,0:33:53.509
didn't have them in my top three but I

0:33:51.559,0:33:56.179
might have to revisit my top three

0:33:53.509,0:33:58.070
because wow just one more time to go for

0:33:56.179,0:33:59.809
the US and if they carry on with this

0:33:58.070,0:34:01.429
this is the inward standing back was

0:33:59.809,0:34:04.009
spinning forward towards the diving

0:34:01.429,0:34:05.690
board fantastic synchronization the

0:34:04.009,0:34:07.759
judges have got to give them eights plus

0:34:05.690,0:34:10.639
for that execution a little bit off but

0:34:07.759,0:34:11.899
my goodness me if area near the 70 point

0:34:10.639,0:34:14.720
marked and that's going to keep them

0:34:11.899,0:34:16.970
well in contention the coaches like here

0:34:14.720,0:34:20.659
are definitely medal prospects after

0:34:16.970,0:34:24.470
that eighths on the right 7.5 on the

0:34:20.659,0:34:28.700
left and he reckons wholly on firmly a

0:34:24.470,0:34:30.980
tight grip on that second place hasn't

0:34:28.700,0:34:33.440
been Malaysia's day though certainly

0:34:30.980,0:34:37.460
hasn't then they come next Canada with

0:34:33.440,0:34:39.470
Emily Haman's and Jennifer Abel verse 2

0:34:37.460,0:34:42.879
and a half somersaults can they make

0:34:39.470,0:34:42.879
their way up into the top three

0:34:43.500,0:34:47.859
well I think they can they needed that

0:34:45.790,0:34:49.060
one Bob that was important they're a

0:34:47.859,0:34:50.859
little bit off the pace

0:34:49.060,0:34:53.050
Emily Hamer's of course her fourth

0:34:50.859,0:34:54.700
Olympic Games three medals in three

0:34:53.050,0:34:56.260
separate games looking for a fourth here

0:34:54.700,0:34:58.420
today and that certainly is going to

0:34:56.260,0:35:00.490
help their campaign there we are landing

0:34:58.420,0:35:03.010
on in the diving board swinging the arms

0:35:00.490,0:35:04.570
increasing the rotation little bit out

0:35:03.010,0:35:06.190
on the spin speeds they're entering the

0:35:04.570,0:35:07.540
water at the same time they're going to

0:35:06.190,0:35:09.940
get eighths across the board on that

0:35:07.540,0:35:11.980
I've seen better from the canadian pair

0:35:09.940,0:35:14.109
but when it needed to be it was right

0:35:11.980,0:35:16.030
there on the money so i think back up in

0:35:14.109,0:35:18.010
contention and of course as we've been

0:35:16.030,0:35:19.450
saying the judges don't see that replay

0:35:18.010,0:35:22.210
they have to judge in what they see

0:35:19.450,0:35:24.840
initially and you might have seen the

0:35:22.210,0:35:26.950
regular entry on the right nonetheless

0:35:24.840,0:35:28.690
points are pretty good at for canada

0:35:26.950,0:35:30.700
points have not really been forthcoming

0:35:28.690,0:35:35.170
from malaysia today reverse two and a

0:35:30.700,0:35:37.480
half the pang and zhang well that's

0:35:35.170,0:35:39.760
their best dive of today beautiful entry

0:35:37.480,0:35:41.980
in the water dive is close diver closest

0:35:39.760,0:35:43.869
to us they've certainly dug into the

0:35:41.980,0:35:45.940
bottom of their diving toybox and find

0:35:43.869,0:35:47.650
that one from somewhere because yeah

0:35:45.940,0:35:49.060
they haven't been on Form today at all

0:35:47.650,0:35:50.830
looked as though they were going to be a

0:35:49.060,0:35:52.330
little bit out of time there and I seem

0:35:50.830,0:35:54.550
to get it together in the end

0:35:52.330,0:35:58.030
and look at this beautiful entry into

0:35:54.550,0:36:00.670
the water so x1 execution mark will be

0:35:58.030,0:36:02.920
very high I think well let's go for

0:36:00.670,0:36:05.680
eight I think would be a fair one for

0:36:02.920,0:36:07.240
the synchro on that rainy day in London

0:36:05.680,0:36:10.359
taking a while for them to warm up isn't

0:36:07.240,0:36:12.369
it eight on the Left 7.5 and eights on

0:36:10.359,0:36:14.560
the right yeah a little bit happy with

0:36:12.369,0:36:17.410
that but all the damage done early on in

0:36:14.560,0:36:19.000
the diving program lastly but by no

0:36:17.410,0:36:21.010
means least late this meant to get and

0:36:19.000,0:36:24.340
feather over with their fourth round

0:36:21.010,0:36:25.810
dive well they looked as though they

0:36:24.340,0:36:27.130
were running away from a fire then as

0:36:25.810,0:36:28.990
they made their way down the diving

0:36:27.130,0:36:31.359
board two seem to be rushing into it a

0:36:28.990,0:36:33.220
little bit but then pushing the water

0:36:31.359,0:36:34.660
away they're in frustration but I think

0:36:33.220,0:36:36.670
it was actually okay they're certainly

0:36:34.660,0:36:38.109
not going to be a medal contention well

0:36:36.670,0:36:40.270
that's one of their better dives I think

0:36:38.109,0:36:41.890
they'll get them over 70 points there

0:36:40.270,0:36:43.540
you know synchronization is good they're

0:36:41.890,0:36:45.880
in alignment they're spinning at the

0:36:43.540,0:36:48.160
same time finishing a little bit low on

0:36:45.880,0:36:50.610
to the water but actually that's a good

0:36:48.160,0:36:54.250
tie from the Ukrainians

0:36:50.610,0:36:57.670
last round solar come their fourth round

0:36:54.250,0:37:02.040
score is this eight and eight point five

0:36:57.670,0:37:05.500
on the right and two eight on the left

0:37:02.040,0:37:07.540
so with six more dives to come eight

0:37:05.500,0:37:10.810
more dives to come in terms of the

0:37:07.540,0:37:13.720
competitors here we are with the fourth

0:37:10.810,0:37:15.100
round standings China USA Canada one two

0:37:13.720,0:37:17.920
three but look at the gap not much

0:37:15.100,0:37:19.540
between two and five really Australians

0:37:17.920,0:37:21.760
to have a chance to sneak back in there

0:37:19.540,0:37:23.800
great britain in seventh it looks like

0:37:21.760,0:37:29.440
Malaysia are tailed off going into the

0:37:23.800,0:37:32.290
final round so the final round of dives

0:37:29.440,0:37:35.470
in the women's synchronized 3-meter

0:37:32.290,0:37:38.350
springboard it would seem the gold is

0:37:35.470,0:37:40.750
going to China not unexpectedly but the

0:37:38.350,0:37:42.610
silver is very much still up for grabs

0:37:40.750,0:37:44.890
and here are a pair who are in

0:37:42.610,0:37:46.270
contention for that why do they can get

0:37:44.890,0:37:50.110
this right there in with two and a half

0:37:46.270,0:37:52.930
somersaults in the pike position last

0:37:50.110,0:37:57.120
dive for ten yet can yato and Francesca

0:37:52.930,0:37:57.120
dalla pay of Italy

0:38:04.170,0:38:08.710
all the pressure was on have they

0:38:06.640,0:38:11.140
responded with a big enough dive the

0:38:08.710,0:38:14.800
synchronization was good rotating at the

0:38:11.140,0:38:17.170
same speed and she's into the water at

0:38:14.800,0:38:19.359
the same time squeezing into that Pike

0:38:17.170,0:38:21.550
shape no daylight in between the thighs

0:38:19.359,0:38:23.100
and the chest that seems pretty good to

0:38:21.550,0:38:25.750
me

0:38:23.100,0:38:27.760
will it be enough though let's wait and

0:38:25.750,0:38:29.650
see what the judges think just waiting

0:38:27.760,0:38:31.780
for confirmation of the diving score

0:38:29.650,0:38:33.730
hasn't come up on the scoreboard as yet

0:38:31.780,0:38:34.359
we might have a little glitch in the

0:38:33.730,0:38:36.460
system

0:38:34.359,0:38:39.820
and be looking around waiting for it to

0:38:36.460,0:38:41.590
come here it is at last 70 1.10 probably

0:38:39.820,0:38:44.710
wanted a bit more than that to be a

0:38:41.590,0:38:47.200
medal contention 7.5 s and eights on the

0:38:44.710,0:38:49.119
right with an 8 point 5 4 re not quite

0:38:47.200,0:38:55.900
gonna be enough to sneak into bronze

0:38:49.119,0:38:59.470
today Australia represented by Smith &

0:38:55.900,0:39:02.619
Stratton for two and a half somersaults

0:38:59.470,0:39:04.840
one twist difficulty 3.0 as all these

0:39:02.619,0:39:06.850
are of course out there 3.1 this is back

0:39:04.840,0:39:09.730
to three for them in the pike position

0:39:06.850,0:39:12.030
Australia the pace but this could change

0:39:09.730,0:39:14.430
all that

0:39:12.030,0:39:16.290
oh it's a big die for them to finish on

0:39:14.430,0:39:17.820
it is normally their best dive but I'm

0:39:16.290,0:39:19.680
pretty sure there'd be a little bit

0:39:17.820,0:39:21.750
disappointed with their overall

0:39:19.680,0:39:23.910
performance today entering the water

0:39:21.750,0:39:27.180
they're good synchronization but both

0:39:23.910,0:39:28.800
over from vertical here we are one and a

0:39:27.180,0:39:30.480
half somersaults there's the one twist

0:39:28.800,0:39:31.920
great synchronization of both of them

0:39:30.480,0:39:33.450
over from vertical so actually the

0:39:31.920,0:39:36.810
judges the synchronized judges should

0:39:33.450,0:39:38.070
really go with that squeezing in a

0:39:36.810,0:39:40.860
valiant effort there but they are a

0:39:38.070,0:39:41.970
little bit off the pace what's happening

0:39:40.860,0:39:44.670
with the scoreboard but there's some

0:39:41.970,0:39:47.850
slight delays well the scores coming up

0:39:44.670,0:39:50.220
now sixty six point six zero there's a

0:39:47.850,0:39:52.140
lot of computations and calculations to

0:39:50.220,0:39:53.520
be done with the new scoring system I

0:39:52.140,0:39:56.070
think computer might be just struggling

0:39:53.520,0:39:57.660
a little bit well that puts Australia

0:39:56.070,0:39:59.220
into second place behind the Italians

0:39:57.660,0:40:02.040
and I think that means there will be no

0:39:59.220,0:40:04.050
Australian medal today and they're

0:40:02.040,0:40:05.880
getting enough as it is in the pool in

0:40:04.050,0:40:09.870
the swimming so I think we can there let

0:40:05.880,0:40:12.120
them off on this occasion well you won't

0:40:09.870,0:40:14.460
see perfection in action generally comes

0:40:12.120,0:40:18.630
from the Chinese and here comes the last

0:40:14.460,0:40:21.840
dive of Wu and hurt because she woke

0:40:18.630,0:40:24.060
going for three golds in a row in this

0:40:21.840,0:40:28.170
competition he comes their final dive

0:40:24.060,0:40:32.130
will it be their best dive yes it will

0:40:28.170,0:40:34.350
my goodness mate China leaving no room

0:40:32.130,0:40:36.510
for anyone to get anywhere near them

0:40:34.350,0:40:38.250
standing up there the teammates big

0:40:36.510,0:40:41.640
Chinese contingency here as you could

0:40:38.250,0:40:43.950
imagine looking to clean sweep as they

0:40:41.640,0:40:46.080
did last year and I'd say that's one

0:40:43.950,0:40:49.280
gold in the bag of a possible eight

0:40:46.080,0:40:51.930
already my goodness me booming shout

0:40:49.280,0:40:54.510
rewriting the history books more medals

0:40:51.930,0:40:56.760
for that particular athlete well big

0:40:54.510,0:40:58.470
smiles as well how many do you think

0:40:56.760,0:41:00.450
that's worth at home this is what the

0:40:58.470,0:41:01.110
judges will say is worth him going to

0:41:00.450,0:41:03.870
ten yet

0:41:01.110,0:41:05.760
we're up at nine point five s and 9s and

0:41:03.870,0:41:09.090
eight point five s execution they know

0:41:05.760,0:41:10.770
the job is well and truly done as they

0:41:09.090,0:41:13.260
take their total up to three hundred and

0:41:10.770,0:41:14.150
forty six point two zero and that is a

0:41:13.260,0:41:15.560
winning score

0:41:14.150,0:41:17.990
[Applause]

0:41:15.560,0:41:20.110
by some 32 points over Italy but there

0:41:17.990,0:41:23.300
are some other big names still to come

0:41:20.110,0:41:26.870
the USA and Canada after we've seen

0:41:23.300,0:41:30.140
Great Britain's final dive from Alesia

0:41:26.870,0:41:32.240
black and Rebecca gallantry yes Rebecca

0:41:30.140,0:41:35.840
on the left as you look at least here on

0:41:32.240,0:41:41.110
the right and they're going with back

0:41:35.840,0:41:41.110
two and a half somersaults

0:41:46.680,0:41:53.740
or they go Alyssia just making error on

0:41:51.940,0:41:55.570
a final type they're letting go of the

0:41:53.740,0:41:58.060
rotation a little bit earlier frustrate

0:41:55.570,0:41:59.650
there's a mum clapping away oh there's

0:41:58.060,0:42:00.900
nothing you could do there's no magic

0:41:59.650,0:42:02.890
rewind button

0:42:00.900,0:42:05.200
unfortunately the take-off is good

0:42:02.890,0:42:06.970
squeezing into the pike shape Rebekah's

0:42:05.200,0:42:08.680
dive is a reasonable one and this it

0:42:06.970,0:42:10.420
just letting go too early nothing you

0:42:08.680,0:42:11.200
could do once you've let go of your Pike

0:42:10.420,0:42:13.930
shape there she is

0:42:11.200,0:42:16.390
oops and just entering the water they're

0:42:13.930,0:42:17.920
sure to vertigo frustrating but a

0:42:16.390,0:42:20.290
valiant effort there for the girls today

0:42:17.920,0:42:21.970
of course being host nation they got a

0:42:20.290,0:42:24.130
place anywhere above eight would have

0:42:21.970,0:42:26.829
been a bonus for them and that's a shame

0:42:24.130,0:42:27.880
to finish on such a mediocre dive there

0:42:26.829,0:42:29.560
yeah

0:42:27.880,0:42:31.420
probably gonna mean that they'll be

0:42:29.560,0:42:33.550
battling it out with Malaysia for eighth

0:42:31.420,0:42:36.070
place not quite the finish they were

0:42:33.550,0:42:41.200
hoping for to send the crowd home happy

0:42:36.070,0:42:44.170
now the USA not going to overtake the

0:42:41.200,0:42:47.820
Chinese surely but to overtake the

0:42:44.170,0:42:53.500
Italians it's not going to take too much

0:42:47.820,0:42:55.839
gonna take 66 points for them to get

0:42:53.500,0:42:58.270
into second place that should be within

0:42:55.839,0:42:58.930
the compass of Johnson and Bryant on

0:42:58.270,0:43:02.040
their back

0:42:58.930,0:43:02.040
two and a half sour sauce

0:43:05.999,0:43:10.889
while they've done it I think that's

0:43:08.009,0:43:12.809
gonna be the us on the podium now I did

0:43:10.889,0:43:13.379
not predict that one I didn't see it

0:43:12.809,0:43:17.909
coming

0:43:13.379,0:43:19.859
they have been steadfast unwavering Wow

0:43:17.909,0:43:21.869
this could be the comeback for USA

0:43:19.859,0:43:23.789
diving they used to rule the roost when

0:43:21.869,0:43:26.219
it came to diving and I of course

0:43:23.789,0:43:28.829
Chinese are the supreme athletes in all

0:43:26.219,0:43:30.689
the disciplines us are working hard

0:43:28.829,0:43:32.369
behind the scenes Steve Foley of course

0:43:30.689,0:43:34.109
national performance director out there

0:43:32.369,0:43:36.509
for the past four years obviously

0:43:34.109,0:43:38.159
working his magic and let's see what the

0:43:36.509,0:43:39.359
total score is for the u.s. girls

0:43:38.159,0:43:41.209
because they're going to definitely be

0:43:39.359,0:43:43.679
in front of Italy now they know

0:43:41.209,0:43:46.109
seventy-two does put them in front of

0:43:43.679,0:43:49.229
Italy with a Ted Rogers three two one

0:43:46.109,0:43:50.999
all working well for them

0:43:49.229,0:43:52.949
as they take the silver medal at the

0:43:50.999,0:43:56.999
moment but it is not yet

0:43:52.949,0:44:01.049
cast in summer because we have jover

0:43:56.999,0:44:03.779
Abel Emily Haman's going for Canada but

0:44:01.049,0:44:06.119
they've got to get what 74 points very

0:44:03.779,0:44:07.709
nearly it's a lot to ask for this

0:44:06.119,0:44:10.379
forward two and a half some sorts one

0:44:07.709,0:44:13.139
twist yeah 74 is what they're looking at

0:44:10.379,0:44:18.199
you will take a point or two on the

0:44:13.139,0:44:18.199
Canadians final dive of this competition

0:44:18.850,0:44:24.160
well the pressure is on now have they

0:44:21.520,0:44:26.020
responded my goodness they're little bit

0:44:24.160,0:44:27.910
off their game today that's going to be

0:44:26.020,0:44:30.610
close I think you're maybe good enough

0:44:27.910,0:44:32.830
to take out the italians but is it good

0:44:30.610,0:44:34.800
enough to take out the u.s. here we go

0:44:32.830,0:44:37.270
landing on the end of the diving board

0:44:34.800,0:44:39.460
little bit of discrepancy on the timing

0:44:37.270,0:44:41.170
they're putting in the water at the same

0:44:39.460,0:44:43.030
time different distances for the board

0:44:41.170,0:44:45.370
I'm not sure what the judges are going

0:44:43.030,0:44:47.110
to make of it they have an exceptional

0:44:45.370,0:44:49.120
pairing maybe the judges will go with

0:44:47.110,0:44:51.640
them everyone in this orders were

0:44:49.120,0:44:54.160
holding their breath let's see what yes

0:44:51.640,0:44:57.370
they have just snuck into third place

0:44:54.160,0:45:01.470
and put the Italian sound of forth

0:44:57.370,0:45:05.220
they've done it by just over two points

0:45:01.470,0:45:08.200
2.6 to be absolutely accurate on it and

0:45:05.220,0:45:10.540
Canada sneaked into third the u.s. a

0:45:08.200,0:45:12.340
second I think they've just started to

0:45:10.540,0:45:13.810
realize what's happened there they had

0:45:12.340,0:45:16.570
to wait a little while for the scores to

0:45:13.810,0:45:20.380
come up but it is Canada who edged out

0:45:16.570,0:45:22.750
the Italians and the Australians will be

0:45:20.380,0:45:26.060
in fourth and fifth now it's a question

0:45:22.750,0:45:27.360
of who's going to finish bottom now

0:45:26.060,0:45:30.250
[Music]

0:45:27.360,0:45:31.840
Britain will be watching on see what

0:45:30.250,0:45:34.720
happens with Malaysia who are currently

0:45:31.840,0:45:39.670
in final place as the final dive of

0:45:34.720,0:45:42.490
Zhang and pango they've had a tough day

0:45:39.670,0:45:43.330
at the office not in the kind of form

0:45:42.490,0:45:45.960
that certainly got them the

0:45:43.330,0:45:48.340
qualification for this top eight only

0:45:45.960,0:45:50.290
straight Olympic final across the

0:45:48.340,0:45:51.370
qualification six months ago here in the

0:45:50.290,0:45:53.770
Aquatic Centre

0:45:51.370,0:45:55.540
I think panda leaner is suffering from

0:45:53.770,0:45:57.190
an injury so that's certainly hampered a

0:45:55.540,0:46:00.130
training lower back problem finishing

0:45:57.190,0:46:01.600
low on the water their synchronization

0:46:00.130,0:46:03.700
is pretty good though spin speeds have

0:46:01.600,0:46:06.670
on Andrews into the water a little over

0:46:03.700,0:46:08.320
from vertical as I mentioned so pretty

0:46:06.670,0:46:09.870
good tie for them let's see if it's good

0:46:08.320,0:46:12.370
enough to take them off the bottom spot

0:46:09.870,0:46:14.440
well they're fourth round I was by far

0:46:12.370,0:46:16.630
their best and that didn't really match

0:46:14.440,0:46:20.410
it sixty four point eight zero for Pam

0:46:16.630,0:46:23.190
and Chong and they will likely finish in

0:46:20.410,0:46:23.190
bottom place

0:46:23.770,0:46:29.600
last dive of the competition hasn't

0:46:27.650,0:46:32.420
really been fed her over and piss men

0:46:29.600,0:46:34.490
skiers day and they will complete their

0:46:32.420,0:46:36.820
day on the board at least with a forward

0:46:34.490,0:46:39.110
two and a half somersaults and one twist

0:46:36.820,0:46:40.520
really it's all about trying to move up

0:46:39.110,0:46:44.180
the standings as best they can

0:46:40.520,0:46:46.760
oh it ended up okay in the end

0:46:44.180,0:46:48.350
that I have a closest to it miss Mensa

0:46:46.760,0:46:49.790
girl and in way back from the end of the

0:46:48.350,0:46:51.170
diving board now let me tell you there

0:46:49.790,0:46:52.610
isn't very much spring there on the

0:46:51.170,0:46:55.310
springboard you need to be right on the

0:46:52.610,0:46:56.900
end to get the elevation you can just

0:46:55.310,0:46:58.520
see there a good foot back from the end

0:46:56.900,0:47:00.500
of the diving board she does so well to

0:46:58.520,0:47:02.510
execute the diver there's the twist into

0:47:00.500,0:47:04.190
the water that's really good sink remove

0:47:02.510,0:47:06.760
them up a notch but I think they left

0:47:04.190,0:47:09.110
themselves a little bit too much to do

0:47:06.760,0:47:11.570
nice overhead shot there just showing

0:47:09.110,0:47:13.910
how much the divers have to do to

0:47:11.570,0:47:17.420
complete now smile in a wave not a great

0:47:13.910,0:47:19.310
day for them sixth place for Miss

0:47:17.420,0:47:21.650
Minsker and Federer over with those

0:47:19.310,0:47:23.900
eights on the right hand side and 7.5

0:47:21.650,0:47:25.340
and 7 on the left all those scores with

0:47:23.900,0:47:28.730
the line through them do not count

0:47:25.340,0:47:32.060
towards their total score well maybe a

0:47:28.730,0:47:34.990
bonus medal here for the USA certainly a

0:47:32.060,0:47:38.420
silver look how excited they are

0:47:34.990,0:47:42.710
American team very very happy and they

0:47:38.420,0:47:44.630
finish some 25 points behind China and

0:47:42.710,0:47:47.150
then they do finish five points ahead of

0:47:44.630,0:47:49.910
Canada there's always a Canadian USA

0:47:47.150,0:47:52.280
rivalry and today it was the Americans

0:47:49.910,0:47:54.770
who just got the measure of the maple

0:47:52.280,0:47:56.600
leaf I think it probably means more to

0:47:54.770,0:47:59.480
the Americans it doesn't even else here

0:47:56.600,0:48:02.020
Emily Haman's their fourth Olympic medal

0:47:59.480,0:48:04.370
at a fourth Olympic Games that is

0:48:02.020,0:48:05.870
incredible the first woman in the

0:48:04.370,0:48:06.560
history to ever do that in the sport of

0:48:05.870,0:48:09.290
diving

0:48:06.560,0:48:12.260
what it either now of course China won

0:48:09.290,0:48:15.200
all but won that gold medal in Beijing

0:48:12.260,0:48:16.670
Matthew Mitchum stopping that run four

0:48:15.200,0:48:19.970
years ago well they're off and running

0:48:16.670,0:48:23.540
again at Wu and her with the winning

0:48:19.970,0:48:25.010
score and Wu's third gold medal in the

0:48:23.540,0:48:28.100
3-meter springboard with different

0:48:25.010,0:48:30.110
partners second USA there Canada Italy

0:48:28.100,0:48:31.630
in Australia missing out great britain

0:48:30.110,0:48:42.700
fishing in seven

0:48:31.630,0:48:45.390
[Applause]

0:48:42.700,0:48:47.590
well look at that the Americans are

0:48:45.390,0:48:50.140
absolutely delighted they'll have their

0:48:47.590,0:48:51.700
medal sir me very soon but when we came

0:48:50.140,0:48:54.310
into this I didn't ask you Leon who you

0:48:51.700,0:48:55.960
thought might be in the mix and yeah we

0:48:54.310,0:48:58.060
kind of downplayed the chance of the

0:48:55.960,0:48:59.650
Americans but I think there's something

0:48:58.060,0:49:01.450
about this Paul it's worked so well for

0:48:59.650,0:49:03.130
the swimmers now saina work really well

0:49:01.450,0:49:03.990
for their divers as well yeah certainly

0:49:03.130,0:49:06.100
they're obviously

0:49:03.990,0:49:07.360
thriving on the momentum that's been

0:49:06.100,0:49:09.370
created in the pool look at Jennifer

0:49:07.360,0:49:11.560
able their tears or why and this is so

0:49:09.370,0:49:13.570
tough for the divers you know it's a

0:49:11.560,0:49:15.370
straight final the Olympic Games is a

0:49:13.570,0:49:17.290
bit of a game of life you know if you

0:49:15.370,0:49:19.630
make one slight mistake in a pairing it

0:49:17.290,0:49:21.610
can be all over as we saw there wasn't

0:49:19.630,0:49:23.500
working out today for the Italians or

0:49:21.610,0:49:25.540
the Australians in fourth and fifth

0:49:23.500,0:49:27.400
respectively and I thought they would

0:49:25.540,0:49:29.260
have been mixing it up a little bit more

0:49:27.400,0:49:31.780
smiles around Emily Haman's what an

0:49:29.260,0:49:35.080
athlete for Olympic Games in for medals

0:49:31.780,0:49:38.310
Wow truly extraordinary and look at the

0:49:35.080,0:49:40.930
amount of people here local time is 346

0:49:38.310,0:49:44.620
on a Sunday afternoon and that is

0:49:40.930,0:49:46.780
absolutely round we're looking at 16 17

0:49:44.620,0:49:48.460
thousand people here watching diving and

0:49:46.780,0:49:51.310
quite right to diving is one of the hot

0:49:48.460,0:49:53.380
tickets in town and of course Tom Daley

0:49:51.310,0:49:56.470
day tomorrow which will mean that this

0:49:53.380,0:49:58.360
place will be rammed it's good to see

0:49:56.470,0:50:01.200
diving shining in the spotlight and that

0:49:58.360,0:50:03.430
was an exciting contest certainly wasn't

0:50:01.200,0:50:04.810
you know a downto that was certainly

0:50:03.430,0:50:07.210
down to the last dive to see where those

0:50:04.810,0:50:08.980
medal what medals were going to go apart

0:50:07.210,0:50:11.890
from the gold which right from the start

0:50:08.980,0:50:14.380
I just had a sneaky suspicion the women

0:50:11.890,0:50:16.630
Sharon heezy or her Z we're going to

0:50:14.380,0:50:18.880
romp home once again as Olympic

0:50:16.630,0:50:21.250
champions and that they have done of

0:50:18.880,0:50:23.410
course it will be the Tim metre synchro

0:50:21.250,0:50:26.920
an Avenger you know very much about Leon

0:50:23.410,0:50:28.510
having won silver in Athens in 2004 we

0:50:26.920,0:50:31.630
also have of course the men's equivalent

0:50:28.510,0:50:34.600
3-meter springboard competition and then

0:50:31.630,0:50:36.190
we have the women's 10 metre synchro as

0:50:34.600,0:50:37.690
well before we get involved in the

0:50:36.190,0:50:39.430
individual should explain of course this

0:50:37.690,0:50:41.470
goes straight to final it's top eight

0:50:39.430,0:50:43.690
here once we get into the individual

0:50:41.470,0:50:46.090
events later in the week and indeed into

0:50:43.690,0:50:47.530
next week there will be preliminaries

0:50:46.090,0:50:50.109
then there'll be so many files in the

0:50:47.530,0:50:53.240
nuddy finals

0:50:50.109,0:50:54.650
awaiting the medal ceremony he might

0:50:53.240,0:50:56.329
take a while for the Americans to calm

0:50:54.650,0:50:58.849
down before the guests she kid in there

0:50:56.329,0:51:00.650
and that meant so much them in there it

0:50:58.849,0:51:02.780
may be their expectancy coming in here

0:51:00.650,0:51:04.790
was they weren't gonna do anything well

0:51:02.780,0:51:06.829
I think you can't come in with with that

0:51:04.790,0:51:09.140
kind of focus I know those girls have

0:51:06.829,0:51:10.880
you know I think every athlete you know

0:51:09.140,0:51:13.640
out there today dreams of standing on

0:51:10.880,0:51:15.950
that podium and when it comes down to it

0:51:13.640,0:51:17.780
it's about making each and every one of

0:51:15.950,0:51:19.490
those five dives count and it's about

0:51:17.780,0:51:21.829
being consistent you're going to hear me

0:51:19.490,0:51:23.630
use that word a lot over these two and a

0:51:21.829,0:51:26.540
half weeks because it is about

0:51:23.630,0:51:28.640
consistency you cannot afford to do for

0:51:26.540,0:51:30.559
exceptional dives and then one mediocre

0:51:28.640,0:51:33.440
dive each and every dive has to be

0:51:30.559,0:51:34.849
consistently exceptional to stand on

0:51:33.440,0:51:37.940
that podium and that's what we saw from

0:51:34.849,0:51:40.430
from Team USA today the girls over you

0:51:37.940,0:51:42.109
know in their early 20s and a very very

0:51:40.430,0:51:44.869
impressive partnership and they you know

0:51:42.109,0:51:46.609
held it together when it counted and you

0:51:44.869,0:51:48.619
saw the Canadians wobbling they ended up

0:51:46.609,0:51:51.109
with the bronze in the end but mistakes

0:51:48.619,0:51:52.640
and a little bit of uncertainty from the

0:51:51.109,0:51:54.380
Italians in the Australians who I

0:51:52.640,0:51:56.329
thought would be out there mixing it up

0:51:54.380,0:51:58.280
a little bit closer for those top spots

0:51:56.329,0:51:59.900
I just wonder if some of these pairings

0:51:58.280,0:52:03.290
we won't see again you talk about the

0:51:59.900,0:52:05.000
Canadians is it likely or unlikely we'll

0:52:03.290,0:52:07.579
see Haman's and Abel in four years time

0:52:05.000,0:52:09.290
I would say unlikely but I don't want to

0:52:07.579,0:52:12.049
speak firmly I mean she's 30 years old

0:52:09.290,0:52:13.369
now and I continue diving till I was 30

0:52:12.049,0:52:15.619
and I'll tell you it hurts a lot more

0:52:13.369,0:52:17.329
when you get into your late 20s Emily of

0:52:15.619,0:52:19.880
course was an exceptional platform diver

0:52:17.329,0:52:21.530
Olympic medalist and world champion in

0:52:19.880,0:52:23.089
fact on the platform and then did the

0:52:21.530,0:52:25.069
sensible thing and retired to the

0:52:23.089,0:52:27.020
springboard it's a little bit closer to

0:52:25.069,0:52:29.359
the water it doesn't tend to beat you up

0:52:27.020,0:52:33.020
quite as much and my goodness me she is

0:52:29.359,0:52:35.299
such an all-round diver competing in the

0:52:33.020,0:52:37.670
springboard synchros on both events of

0:52:35.299,0:52:40.430
platform Wow she'll go down in history

0:52:37.670,0:52:42.559
the first woman ever to win four Olympic

0:52:40.430,0:52:44.930
medals at four consecutive games

0:52:42.559,0:52:47.030
what about pointers for the three meter

0:52:44.930,0:52:49.220
individual are we again looking at China

0:52:47.030,0:52:51.349
ruling the roost in that yeah I think

0:52:49.220,0:52:53.869
you would be foolish to bet against

0:52:51.349,0:52:55.760
China you know they are certainly head

0:52:53.869,0:52:57.109
and shoulders certainly in the women's

0:52:55.760,0:52:58.760
springboard event both in the sinker and

0:52:57.109,0:53:00.470
the individual their head and shoulders

0:52:58.760,0:53:02.299
above the rest of the field but of

0:53:00.470,0:53:04.219
course you and I have sat through

0:53:02.299,0:53:05.630
many competitions but we can see some

0:53:04.219,0:53:07.369
interesting things happen I think it was

0:53:05.630,0:53:09.829
in the men's three metre synchro

0:53:07.369,0:53:12.679
springboard in Athens you know two days

0:53:09.829,0:53:15.199
after Peter and I stood on the podium we

0:53:12.679,0:53:17.420
saw a calamity to say the least where

0:53:15.199,0:53:20.269
the Chinese of course ended up failing

0:53:17.420,0:53:21.829
their last dive in coming last which you

0:53:20.269,0:53:23.630
know I don't think anyone saw coming so

0:53:21.829,0:53:25.339
I don't want to sit here now and give

0:53:23.630,0:53:27.079
the audience the impression that it's

0:53:25.339,0:53:28.999
all sewn up the Chinese you know it's

0:53:27.079,0:53:31.189
they are they are the frontrunners the

0:53:28.999,0:53:33.170
bookies favourites if you will but you

0:53:31.189,0:53:35.539
know they still go to perform in this

0:53:33.170,0:53:37.729
order - you know in this arena with all

0:53:35.539,0:53:40.009
the eyes of the world on them and it's

0:53:37.729,0:53:41.829
no mean feat I think it's unlikely we

0:53:40.009,0:53:45.489
will ever see a 3-meter springboard

0:53:41.829,0:53:47.869
event synchro event like that ever again

0:53:45.489,0:53:50.569
because there's just so many memories of

0:53:47.869,0:53:51.920
the Greeks who who again got host nation

0:53:50.569,0:53:54.769
spot probably would have been there

0:53:51.920,0:53:56.209
otherwise who went on to win it and also

0:53:54.769,0:53:57.739
the fact that somebody jumped in the

0:53:56.209,0:53:59.029
diving pit in the middle of the

0:53:57.739,0:54:01.819
competition something else I've never

0:53:59.029,0:54:03.799
ever seen again or before you know

0:54:01.819,0:54:05.900
that's right and as we say anything can

0:54:03.799,0:54:08.209
happen so I'm not wishing for anything

0:54:05.900,0:54:10.039
like that to happen once again but who

0:54:08.209,0:54:11.630
knows what the yes stay stay tuned

0:54:10.039,0:54:13.099
everyone stay tuned you never know

0:54:11.630,0:54:15.289
what's going to happen in the in the

0:54:13.099,0:54:17.809
diving pool we have all week and next

0:54:15.289,0:54:20.179
week just a remarkable reaction from

0:54:17.809,0:54:21.529
both the Americans and the Canadians and

0:54:20.179,0:54:26.589
of course they at the moment just doing

0:54:21.529,0:54:29.539
their poolside interviews wave from the

0:54:26.589,0:54:33.890
British competitors and you see a black

0:54:29.539,0:54:35.359
and Rebecca Gannon treat USA would not

0:54:33.890,0:54:37.519
otherwise have been here had it not been

0:54:35.359,0:54:38.839
host nation but they got a great

0:54:37.519,0:54:41.150
exhibition not actually finishing and

0:54:38.839,0:54:42.140
bottom rung we'll give them a super

0:54:41.150,0:54:44.539
coach yeah well we talked about Alisha

0:54:42.140,0:54:46.429
as a prospect for the future that

0:54:44.539,0:54:47.719
there's so many good young divers that

0:54:46.429,0:54:49.910
rot all around the world they're coming

0:54:47.719,0:54:51.799
through at this stage and this is a good

0:54:49.910,0:54:53.479
platform literally for them to move on

0:54:51.799,0:54:56.929
from great springboard for them to

0:54:53.479,0:54:58.489
bounce off more diving metaphors at yeah

0:54:56.929,0:55:02.059
I mean it's fantastic so listen a

0:54:58.489,0:55:05.449
youngest competitor 15 years old gets to

0:55:02.059,0:55:08.209
compete in front of a home crowd in a

0:55:05.449,0:55:09.289
home country wow what an experience I

0:55:08.209,0:55:11.119
can't wait to speak to the girls

0:55:09.289,0:55:12.229
afterwards to see how they find it yes

0:55:11.119,0:55:14.779
of course they're going to look back on

0:55:12.229,0:55:15.920
on their performances say dive number

0:55:14.779,0:55:18.109
three and dive know

0:55:15.920,0:55:21.230
five were under pal we could have done

0:55:18.109,0:55:22.730
better but you know to be here to move

0:55:21.230,0:55:24.650
themselves off the eighth place which

0:55:22.730,0:55:27.619
they were seeded in he's an achievement

0:55:24.650,0:55:29.599
in its own right and you know they look

0:55:27.619,0:55:31.579
great out there and as you mentioned Bob

0:55:29.599,0:55:33.440
Alessia as a bright future ahead of her

0:55:31.579,0:55:35.960
I think noticed the camera kept cutting

0:55:33.440,0:55:37.460
away to work to her mom who and I know

0:55:35.960,0:55:39.200
her mom well and she was certainly

0:55:37.460,0:55:40.700
beside ourselves with nerves I'm glad

0:55:39.200,0:55:42.740
her daughter didn't share the same kind

0:55:40.700,0:55:44.839
of nervous energy that her mum seemed to

0:55:42.740,0:55:47.089
be you know having to deal with their as

0:55:44.839,0:55:49.549
the camera cut away to a new scoring

0:55:47.089,0:55:51.079
system today or a kind of advancement of

0:55:49.549,0:55:53.510
the scoring system today how does it

0:55:51.079,0:55:55.460
work well it's a modified slightly in

0:55:53.510,0:55:57.650
order to try and make it fair and I when

0:55:55.460,0:55:59.420
I was explaining at the beginning it is

0:55:57.650,0:56:01.040
quite difficult to explain

0:55:59.420,0:56:03.500
you know succinctly because it is

0:56:01.040,0:56:05.359
relatively complex however the intention

0:56:03.500,0:56:06.799
behind it is actually very very

0:56:05.359,0:56:09.380
important and that is to try and make it

0:56:06.799,0:56:11.359
fairer you're trying to eliminate you

0:56:09.380,0:56:12.980
know it's a subjective sport but you're

0:56:11.359,0:56:14.690
trying to eliminate any bias that might

0:56:12.980,0:56:16.130
be there so you're always taking the

0:56:14.690,0:56:18.170
highest and lowest score if you're

0:56:16.130,0:56:19.970
always trying to average everything out

0:56:18.170,0:56:21.950
but of course this is a synchronized

0:56:19.970,0:56:24.500
diving competition so you need to wait

0:56:21.950,0:56:26.210
the you know the scores towards the

0:56:24.500,0:56:27.740
synchro to make that the most important

0:56:26.210,0:56:29.960
element otherwise people will start

0:56:27.740,0:56:31.790
concentrating more on the execution if

0:56:29.960,0:56:34.190
the if there's more points if you will

0:56:31.790,0:56:36.559
to be gained from that so I think you

0:56:34.190,0:56:38.030
know FINA have done the right thing you

0:56:36.559,0:56:39.770
know you've got more judges on Paul's

0:56:38.030,0:56:42.109
side now than I've ever seen before but

0:56:39.770,0:56:44.750
I think the intention behind it is the

0:56:42.109,0:56:46.069
right one and I'm hoping it worked and

0:56:44.750,0:56:48.079
certainly the results we're looking at

0:56:46.069,0:56:50.089
today were the results I know sometimes

0:56:48.079,0:56:52.730
we sit here barb and I say oh hang on a

0:56:50.089,0:56:54.020
second in my opinion or near maybe we

0:56:52.730,0:56:56.510
can look at this and say that was an

0:56:54.020,0:56:57.980
unfair finishing order but today you

0:56:56.510,0:57:00.349
know that the judging system and the

0:56:57.980,0:57:03.109
judges got it right this is the fourth

0:57:00.349,0:57:04.790
Olympics we've had synchronized diving I

0:57:03.109,0:57:06.980
think a few people initially thought

0:57:04.790,0:57:08.930
it's gonna work it's really gonna take

0:57:06.980,0:57:10.790
off it's now very much part and parcel

0:57:08.930,0:57:12.290
of the diving program yeah I think it's

0:57:10.790,0:57:13.849
I think it's the highlight in many ways

0:57:12.290,0:57:15.589
of the diving program because you do not

0:57:13.849,0:57:17.180
need to be a diving expert to know

0:57:15.589,0:57:19.640
what's going on in fact I could probably

0:57:17.180,0:57:21.260
take any one of these audience members

0:57:19.640,0:57:22.910
and put them on the pool side there as a

0:57:21.260,0:57:25.490
judge and they wouldn't actually be too

0:57:22.910,0:57:26.690
far away judging the synchro now they

0:57:25.490,0:57:28.099
wouldn't know anything about the

0:57:26.690,0:57:29.380
execution they wouldn't know they're two

0:57:28.099,0:57:31.120
and a half from there three and a half

0:57:29.380,0:57:32.890
might even know they might not know

0:57:31.120,0:57:34.480
they're tucked from their Pike but

0:57:32.890,0:57:36.100
certainly former sink is spectator

0:57:34.480,0:57:38.410
friendly I'm sure the audience will

0:57:36.100,0:57:39.730
agree at home that after a while you

0:57:38.410,0:57:41.140
know listening to Bob and I of course

0:57:39.730,0:57:43.060
you can get into it and know which is a

0:57:41.140,0:57:44.200
good splash and a bad splash but more

0:57:43.060,0:57:45.940
importantly you can see the

0:57:44.200,0:57:47.950
synchronization and the marine plays are

0:57:45.940,0:57:51.040
fantastic and it really brings the sport

0:57:47.950,0:57:53.200
alive and it's yeah as I said spectator

0:57:51.040,0:57:55.180
friendly and I think that's its greatest

0:57:53.200,0:57:56.950
selling point and something else we'll

0:57:55.180,0:57:58.990
see next week Leon when we get to the

0:57:56.950,0:58:01.720
individual it's just how many countries

0:57:58.990,0:58:02.980
now there was a time when you look at a

0:58:01.720,0:58:04.720
selection of countries and there wasn't

0:58:02.980,0:58:06.310
much beyond that but diving seems to

0:58:04.720,0:58:08.500
have really expanded in terms of

0:58:06.310,0:58:10.330
countries who are doing it now yeah

0:58:08.500,0:58:12.940
that's right I mean we saw that for sure

0:58:10.330,0:58:15.250
the World Cup the test event here in

0:58:12.940,0:58:17.020
February the Olympic Games the IOC are

0:58:15.250,0:58:18.910
very much on the ball and they say okay

0:58:17.020,0:58:20.440
you can have your synchro in diving but

0:58:18.910,0:58:22.750
it needs to be a straight final and you

0:58:20.440,0:58:24.160
can have your individual event but it

0:58:22.750,0:58:26.650
needs to be capped so you're only going

0:58:24.160,0:58:28.500
to see 32 competitors in each of the

0:58:26.650,0:58:30.730
individual events so you won't see the

0:58:28.500,0:58:32.860
super spread that we saw at the test

0:58:30.730,0:58:34.990
event where everyone was fiercely trying

0:58:32.860,0:58:36.820
to earn those qualification spots but

0:58:34.990,0:58:38.170
yeah diving is one of those events many

0:58:36.820,0:58:41.380
many countries around the world take

0:58:38.170,0:58:43.180
part and and certainly it's thriving the

0:58:41.380,0:58:44.890
world over and quite right too I maybe

0:58:43.180,0:58:46.840
I'm slightly biased but quite like -

0:58:44.890,0:58:50.080
it's a question you get asked a lot I

0:58:46.840,0:58:52.630
get asked quite a bit as well is why are

0:58:50.080,0:58:54.850
China so dominant is it because it's

0:58:52.630,0:58:58.120
pretty much a job for the Chinese divers

0:58:54.850,0:59:00.880
rather than a sport yeah well you know

0:58:58.120,0:59:03.280
I'm sure you've heard you know many a

0:59:00.880,0:59:05.260
pundit kind of share their their views

0:59:03.280,0:59:06.640
on Chinese dominance in many many

0:59:05.260,0:59:08.890
different sports I mean they're you know

0:59:06.640,0:59:10.960
fighting with the US for for that number

0:59:08.890,0:59:12.760
one spot on the on the overall medal

0:59:10.960,0:59:14.650
table now there's a couple of reasons

0:59:12.760,0:59:16.030
why they're exceptional diving they have

0:59:14.650,0:59:16.750
well it's a game with numbers we've

0:59:16.030,0:59:19.060
heard that before

0:59:16.750,0:59:20.620
but they have a system in China which

0:59:19.060,0:59:23.260
works very well now that system isn't

0:59:20.620,0:59:25.720
particularly fair or some people might

0:59:23.260,0:59:27.730
say ethical where you know you give your

0:59:25.720,0:59:29.860
child away pretty much to these sporting

0:59:27.730,0:59:32.470
institutions and they are given the

0:59:29.860,0:59:34.900
opportunity to train all hours every

0:59:32.470,0:59:37.000
single day for year upon year upon year

0:59:34.900,0:59:38.920
and the ones who do not break in that

0:59:37.000,0:59:41.470
system are the ones that we see here

0:59:38.920,0:59:43.089
today standing on top of the podium so

0:59:41.470,0:59:45.160
it's a very very different

0:59:43.089,0:59:47.589
system - what we have here I started

0:59:45.160,0:59:49.299
diving as a as a hobby a hyperactive

0:59:47.589,0:59:51.160
child who was you know channelled into

0:59:49.299,0:59:53.499
sport to try and give my parents arrest

0:59:51.160,0:59:55.210
and I find it I found a sport that I

0:59:53.499,0:59:58.809
enjoyed but I wasn't really I wasn't

0:59:55.210,1:00:00.880
given away at three years old so it's

0:59:58.809,1:00:02.410
the moment that well it seems the USA

1:00:00.880,1:00:05.710
have definitely been waiting for and

1:00:02.410,1:00:07.329
Canada - it is the victory ceremony for

1:00:05.710,1:00:09.579
the women's synchronized three meter

1:00:07.329,1:00:12.190
spring or just to clear up the teams

1:00:09.579,1:00:14.759
below third finishing an eighth were

1:00:12.190,1:00:17.680
Malaysia Great Britain in seventh

1:00:14.759,1:00:19.930
Federer over and Paz Mexico of Ukraine

1:00:17.680,1:00:22.779
in sixth Australia in fifth the Italians

1:00:19.930,1:00:27.339
just missing out by just about two

1:00:22.779,1:00:29.950
points from getting third place but here

1:00:27.339,1:00:34.450
come those who did make the top three

1:00:29.950,1:00:36.400
and comes the presentation party and the

1:00:34.450,1:00:40.140
appropriate flags which I think we'll

1:00:36.400,1:00:40.140
get right at the diving

1:00:43.030,1:00:52.870
proudly walking in there Zeke booming

1:00:50.380,1:00:56.260
ship taking their position getting ready

1:00:52.870,1:00:59.170
to go through something it's pretty

1:00:56.260,1:01:02.110
routine for them these days picking up a

1:00:59.170,1:01:06.550
gold medal not quite so routine for the

1:01:02.110,1:01:10.030
pair's either side of them however for

1:01:06.550,1:01:12.760
Abel and Emily Haman's to the right and

1:01:10.030,1:01:14.740
to the left the American pair who

1:01:12.760,1:01:17.050
haven't stopped smiley and I think since

1:01:14.740,1:01:22.120
they actually got out of the diving bit

1:01:17.050,1:01:23.250
earlier arm abigail Johnston and Kelsey

1:01:22.120,1:01:28.320
Bryant

1:01:23.250,1:01:32.430
yes mr. happy Mackay IOC member for Oman

1:01:28.320,1:01:36.510
who will be involved in the presentation

1:01:32.430,1:01:39.820
and representing the governing body for

1:01:36.510,1:01:43.450
all water sports swimming diving water

1:01:39.820,1:01:45.990
polo and sink rope

1:01:43.450,1:01:53.890
yes parlo Borelli the Honorary Secretary

1:01:45.990,1:01:56.320
of FINA no smart the outfits turns the

1:01:53.890,1:01:59.400
presentation party with the the medals

1:01:56.320,1:01:59.400
and the flowers

1:02:00.990,1:02:10.170
and the bronze medal going to Jennifer

1:02:04.890,1:02:13.230
Abel and back again for war Emily

1:02:10.170,1:02:16.950
Haman's getting used to this routine

1:02:13.230,1:02:20.820
she's been doing it for many years and

1:02:16.950,1:02:24.150
it still means just as much to hurt to

1:02:20.820,1:02:26.160
have that bronze medal placed around her

1:02:24.150,1:02:28.099
neck another one to add to the

1:02:26.160,1:02:31.920
collection

1:02:28.099,1:02:34.650
Jennifer Abel as well as another one

1:02:31.920,1:02:38.790
which she can cherish as well

1:02:34.650,1:02:43.290
they're good memories of London 2012 for

1:02:38.790,1:02:45.960
those two and even better memories for

1:02:43.290,1:02:51.240
the American pet were about to receive

1:02:45.960,1:02:53.730
there's a great tonight at the end the

1:02:51.240,1:02:56.670
Canadians had absolutely the last time a

1:02:53.730,1:02:58.589
bit better and they will be looking at

1:02:56.670,1:03:01.470
silver but bronze will do there on the

1:02:58.589,1:03:04.609
platform on the metal platform once

1:03:01.470,1:03:04.609
again for Canada

1:03:04.970,1:03:11.829
[Music]

1:03:07.019,1:03:15.069
so a medal for the USA goes to Abigail

1:03:11.829,1:03:17.799
Johnston and Kelsey Bryant and you can

1:03:15.069,1:03:20.289
tell by the look on their faces it means

1:03:17.799,1:03:24.670
a great deal to them and probably

1:03:20.289,1:03:28.390
unexpectedly two predictions before this

1:03:24.670,1:03:30.910
event Americans weren't close to a

1:03:28.390,1:03:35.190
silver medal but they were consistent

1:03:30.910,1:03:38.589
all the way through good opening dives

1:03:35.190,1:03:41.410
and then they had an exceptional third

1:03:38.589,1:03:45.970
round dive which lifted them pretty much

1:03:41.410,1:03:48.329
clear of the pack for second place and

1:03:45.970,1:03:50.740
America add to their tally in the poor

1:03:48.329,1:03:53.190
swimming medals last night a diving

1:03:50.740,1:04:00.940
medal today for Abigail Johnston and

1:03:53.190,1:04:03.490
Kelsey Bryant but no real surprise I

1:04:00.940,1:04:05.380
suppose everybody would have predicted

1:04:03.490,1:04:07.960
it and pretty much everybody would have

1:04:05.380,1:04:10.960
got it right that's China just so

1:04:07.960,1:04:12.430
dominant in women's events you might get

1:04:10.960,1:04:15.579
usurped in one of the men's events

1:04:12.430,1:04:19.509
possibly later in the week but not today

1:04:15.579,1:04:22.299
in the women's and a looming ship will

1:04:19.509,1:04:24.910
step onto the platform now she has done

1:04:22.299,1:04:29.109
on two previous occasions to collect the

1:04:24.910,1:04:35.799
gold medal this time with her Zi and a

1:04:29.109,1:04:41.259
Chinese loving that's rather unusual way

1:04:35.799,1:04:44.920
of picking your medals we go for a

1:04:41.259,1:04:48.530
little walk because they don't circuit

1:04:44.920,1:04:56.300
of the medal podium

1:04:48.530,1:04:58.640
great Chinese response from the Oh a lot

1:04:56.300,1:05:01.430
of Chinese flags out there well Chinese

1:04:58.640,1:05:04.030
fans who follow these divers all over

1:05:01.430,1:05:07.430
the world they go everywhere they go and

1:05:04.030,1:05:09.790
not too far behind and a good raw for

1:05:07.430,1:05:14.869
the Chinese yes

1:05:09.790,1:05:17.060
it's again nosy and we'll Ming chef pick

1:05:14.869,1:05:21.400
up the gold medal in the opening diving

1:05:17.060,1:05:25.329
