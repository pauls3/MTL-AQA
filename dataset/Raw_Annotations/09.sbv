welcome again to the natatorium today we

0:02:05.800,0:02:09.970
have individual medals as the ultimate

0:02:07.690,0:02:12.220
prize for men and women at the classic

0:02:09.970,0:02:15.130
heights of three and ten meters to look

0:02:12.220,0:02:17.350
forward to plus we conclude with an

0:02:15.130,0:02:19.110
innovative team event which will combine

0:02:17.350,0:02:22.239
men and women's springboard and platform

0:02:19.110,0:02:25.959
more of that later but we start with the

0:02:22.239,0:02:28.060
women up on that 10 metre platform well

0:02:25.959,0:02:30.220
occurs once all China has every right to

0:02:28.060,0:02:33.610
host at the very highest level it's

0:02:30.220,0:02:35.680
certainly diving just confirming today's

0:02:33.610,0:02:37.780
program for you a preliminary followed

0:02:35.680,0:02:40.870
by the final event later today

0:02:37.780,0:02:42.610
of course the origins of the sport can

0:02:40.870,0:02:44.709
be traced back to this country to a

0:02:42.610,0:02:47.709
thousand years ago but now in the 21st

0:02:44.709,0:02:50.830
century China dominates the sport at

0:02:47.709,0:02:52.720
Olympic and World Championship level can

0:02:50.830,0:02:54.790
they signpost an extension of their

0:02:52.720,0:02:57.549
goals in the era over the next few days

0:02:54.790,0:03:00.250
with a clean sweep of the titles here at

0:02:57.549,0:03:02.530
the Youth Olympic Games 17 other

0:03:00.250,0:03:04.200
countries will be trying to do something

0:03:02.530,0:03:06.850
about that

0:03:04.200,0:03:09.400
encouraging proud to see this first

0:03:06.850,0:03:10.450
preliminary session grounds expected to

0:03:09.400,0:03:15.400
build as week

0:03:10.450,0:03:17.110
the days of competitions let me explain

0:03:15.400,0:03:18.670
them a bit about the format here the

0:03:17.110,0:03:21.250
qualification process from the diving

0:03:18.670,0:03:23.170
here in Nanjing is a little involved

0:03:21.250,0:03:25.750
FINA held an official qualifying

0:03:23.170,0:03:29.050
competition in March in Guadalajara in

0:03:25.750,0:03:32.170
Mexico the top nine divers in each event

0:03:29.050,0:03:34.000
one qualified places for these games for

0:03:32.170,0:03:36.400
their country and not just for

0:03:34.000,0:03:38.620
themselves so a number of the divers

0:03:36.400,0:03:40.870
from that competition are not here but

0:03:38.620,0:03:43.030
their countries are still representing

0:03:40.870,0:03:44.680
than the hosts Charlotte was guaranteed

0:03:43.030,0:03:47.620
a place of course and there were two

0:03:44.680,0:03:49.780
more universality places which could be

0:03:47.620,0:03:52.150
offered for example if this event the

0:03:49.780,0:03:54.370
extra place was granted to Canada who

0:03:52.150,0:03:58.090
are of course extremely strong in

0:03:54.370,0:04:00.250
women's diving the format is also a

0:03:58.090,0:04:03.310
little different eight dives for the

0:04:00.250,0:04:06.880
women today at 10 meter for dives with a

0:04:03.310,0:04:08.650
total degree of difficulty heading up to

0:04:06.880,0:04:12.280
no more than 7.6

0:04:08.650,0:04:15.609
just saying here the divers who will be

0:04:12.280,0:04:18.070
getting us underway this morning each of

0:04:15.609,0:04:21.639
them with 8 dives these dives are chosen

0:04:18.070,0:04:23.770
from four specified routes then there

0:04:21.639,0:04:25.510
are four more times without any degree

0:04:23.770,0:04:27.250
of difficulty limits where the divers

0:04:25.510,0:04:29.889
have a free rein to show us what they

0:04:27.250,0:04:31.510
can do these are also drawn from a range

0:04:29.889,0:04:34.180
of groups it does sound a little bit

0:04:31.510,0:04:36.130
complicated but don't worry too much

0:04:34.180,0:04:38.770
about the technicalities just sit back

0:04:36.130,0:04:40.810
and enjoy the show one other difference

0:04:38.770,0:04:42.580
I should just point out which will help

0:04:40.810,0:04:44.830
to make the small eagle even more

0:04:42.580,0:04:46.750
competitive the marks when the first

0:04:44.830,0:04:49.030
four dives those are the ones of the

0:04:46.750,0:04:51.789
limited category are carried into the

0:04:49.030,0:04:53.860
final where as usual the divers will

0:04:51.789,0:04:56.440
complete in reverse order for how they

0:04:53.860,0:04:57.450
finish in these preliminaries I'll take

0:04:56.440,0:05:00.990
you through that again as the

0:04:57.450,0:05:03.450
competition involves

0:05:00.990,0:05:05.580
your on-screen graphics will explain

0:05:03.450,0:05:08.220
that how the story and everything works

0:05:05.580,0:05:10.530
quite clearly as I said you can just

0:05:08.220,0:05:13.560
Marvel up what is likely to be a very

0:05:10.530,0:05:17.070
high standard competition diving very

0:05:13.560,0:05:21.320
much a young person sport so you really

0:05:17.070,0:05:24.060
can expect from terrific standards here

0:05:21.320,0:05:27.780
final note of the judging of course

0:05:24.060,0:05:31.530
judges allocate points out of ten in

0:05:27.780,0:05:34.710
half a point the grades each time is

0:05:31.530,0:05:37.080
allocated a degree of difficulty seven

0:05:34.710,0:05:41.340
judges the top two marks the lowest two

0:05:37.080,0:05:43.260
marks are all discarded and the middle

0:05:41.340,0:05:45.870
three marks are then multiplied by the

0:05:43.260,0:05:48.710
degree of difficulty back to you your

0:05:45.870,0:05:48.710
points score

0:05:51.960,0:05:57.360
China absolutely dominated as they do in

0:05:55.410,0:06:00.419
so many international competitions in

0:05:57.360,0:06:03.780
these first Youth Olympic Games four

0:06:00.419,0:06:06.660
years ago in Singapore clean sweep when

0:06:03.780,0:06:09.040
there were just four events then within

0:06:06.660,0:06:13.910
three in ten

0:06:09.040,0:06:17.930
that's often tend to do very marriage

0:06:13.910,0:06:20.210
that the clean sweet so the diving

0:06:17.930,0:06:22.880
competition here in Nanjing finally gets

0:06:20.210,0:06:24.950
underway these competitors will be so

0:06:22.880,0:06:27.470
keen to get into that pool gathered

0:06:24.950,0:06:29.120
press na slick from Ukraine will get us

0:06:27.470,0:06:31.690
underway the forward one and a half

0:06:29.120,0:06:31.690
somersault

0:06:44.610,0:06:50.280
these early dives have quite a low

0:06:47.620,0:06:53.460
degree of difficulty so it's all about

0:06:50.280,0:06:53.460
the execution

0:06:54.420,0:06:58.080
she will be quite high to be so we

0:06:56.760,0:07:01.080
really have to make sure they get the

0:06:58.080,0:07:04.410
dive as flawless as possible the tariffs

0:07:01.080,0:07:10.470
on gammas openly died there's only one

0:07:04.410,0:07:12.950
point six seven point five scooter 36

0:07:39.080,0:07:44.370
[Applause]

0:07:41.910,0:07:47.550
now the coaches will be breaking down

0:07:44.370,0:07:51.360
the dive into its different stages take

0:07:47.550,0:07:54.060
off the various positions through the

0:07:51.360,0:07:56.730
die and of course that entry position

0:07:54.060,0:07:58.470
which although it isn't everything is

0:07:56.730,0:08:01.220
important because it does tend to leave

0:07:58.470,0:08:08.210
that final impression on the judges

0:08:01.220,0:08:08.210
ratio there in 2/7 and a 7.5 34 40

0:08:49.890,0:08:58.950
through the water 7.5 36 there won't be

0:08:54.959,0:09:00.630
a big difference in these scores with

0:08:58.950,0:09:02.640
the low tariff dives it has the

0:09:00.630,0:09:08.850
competition I'd rather sleep things will

0:09:02.640,0:09:14.360
change the arena Fichtner is next from

0:09:31.180,0:09:35.040
you can't really afford to make to the

0:09:33.190,0:09:38.310
leak significant mistakes with these

0:09:35.040,0:09:38.310
opening dives

0:09:39.660,0:09:47.970
Serena needed getting the entry as she

a Chinese supremacy here she is an

went back to those clips Allah acapulco

0:15:33.880,0:15:41.610
but 3360 was not a blazing star for her

0:15:48.090,0:15:51.690
now this will be pleased to just got

0:15:49.890,0:15:53.760

0:20:42.490,0:20:48.670
again you can see for this angle just

0:20:44.720,0:20:48.670
falling away from the vertical there

0:20:51.280,0:20:56.940

0:22:24.340,0:22:29.860
her best butt so hard to pick faults in

0:22:26.620,0:22:31.660
that lovely relaxed clean entry hardly a

0:22:42.850,0:22:48.910
this the opening competition well

0:22:46.240,0:22:51.880
they're going to be keen to dole out

0:22:48.910,0:22:55.440
those nines and tens which need to be

0:22:51.880,0:22:55.440
earned but do get the crowd going

her coach and she's he said sorry but

0:24:03.020,0:24:07.140
she was only able to go to complete the

0:24:05.490,0:24:11.160
qualifying event because she finished

0:24:07.140,0:24:13.590
her exams the educational standards are

0:24:11.160,0:24:16.080
very strict indeed Pike position there

0:24:13.590,0:24:19.620
in Egypt and it's not easy for them to

0:24:16.080,0:24:22.860
combine the training with the education

0:24:19.620,0:24:25.280
standards only four points there for

first taste of international competition

0:24:46.340,0:24:56.370
[Applause]

0:24:53.130,0:24:59.230
sound of the guys there

0:24:56.370,0:25:02.020
we relaxed

0:24:59.230,0:25:04.380
the position held by the way through the

0:25:02.020,0:25:04.380
entry

0:25:04.710,0:25:11.899
judges liked it as well 50 points that's

0:25:07.409,0:25:11.899
a very good encouragement there

0:25:13.800,0:25:23.280
I've counted off goal offer really

0:25:19.290,0:25:23.280
getting off to the flying start

0:25:37.210,0:25:43.820
[Applause]

0:25:39.630,0:25:43.820
don't you look heavy there okay

0:25:45.679,0:25:50.789
the powerful that I've uh compared to

0:25:48.269,0:25:53.100
the extremely slender Chinese girl for

0:25:50.789,0:25:55.559
example that's a very well held entry

0:25:53.100,0:26:01.169
there though really tight control of her

0:25:55.559,0:26:04.999
core strength three 8:48 is a little bit

0:26:01.169,0:26:04.999
more what we would have been expecting

0:26:10.740,0:26:17.649
two rounds of the competition then we'll

0:26:14.950,0:26:19.450
shake pain really setting the standards

0:26:17.649,0:26:22.299
but to the French girl really doing very

0:26:19.450,0:26:24.190
well indeed still waiting for the other

0:26:22.299,0:26:29.789
established stars to make a bit of a

0:26:24.190,0:26:29.789
show that very much early stages here

0:26:47.390,0:27:03.180
on to round 3 trading coach they're

80 year olds point wanted good degree of

0:27:25.580,0:27:30.160
experience to bring into this

0:27:27.470,0:27:30.160
competition

0:27:31.210,0:27:38.450
she competed at the World Championships

0:27:34.130,0:27:40.880
in Barcelona last year just missed out

0:27:38.450,0:27:44.240
on a place of the final edition 13th in

0:27:40.880,0:27:47.350
the semi final 21:40 there with the

seven after two rounds it's back down

0:28:32.409,0:28:39.849

0:29:05.980,0:29:11.919
it's all about eradicating any

0:29:08.429,0:29:15.010
unnecessary mistakes in this first round

0:29:11.919,0:29:17.230
before big these lower tariff dives as

0:29:15.010,0:29:19.570
cleanly as positive just like he's just

0:29:17.230,0:29:23.130
looking away they're losing the extra

0:29:19.570,0:29:30.770
splash we said it was red instead of 80

0:29:23.130,0:29:32.520
[Music]

0:29:30.770,0:29:36.680
see a leader

0:29:32.520,0:29:36.680
it's from Belarus

0:29:44.140,0:29:51.180
understand forward somersault here got

0:29:48.370,0:29:53.650
to show she's in control of fact

0:29:51.180,0:29:56.170
gymnastic maneuver to the judges before

0:29:53.650,0:29:59.100
she releases but for the push-off to see

0:29:56.170,0:29:59.100
how much hard she can get

0:30:05.170,0:30:09.760
well there was a long spring off the

0:30:06.970,0:30:14.309
platform there it was a bit more than a

0:30:09.760,0:30:14.309
fall straight through into the dive

0:30:15.480,0:30:23.880
so hard to hold it there and then get

0:30:18.220,0:30:23.880
raunchy 138 points go down as far as six

0:30:27.650,0:30:39.010
so they kind of lead a today's bill - no

0:30:30.710,0:30:39.010
I feel like Pike's worth 1 point 8

0:31:03.810,0:31:08.550
the junkies got a good side all of you

0:31:06.180,0:31:12.300
there's four on one side three on the

0:31:08.550,0:31:13.470
opposite seen all those high chairs just

0:31:12.300,0:31:17.610
as she goes through the wheels are there

0:31:13.470,0:31:19.560
a lot of water splashed on the entry

0:31:17.610,0:31:23.390
which leaves a bad impression that she

0:31:19.560,0:31:23.390
underscores 30 to 40

0:31:26.600,0:31:40.320
Molly Carlson this diver at the games a

0:31:35.060,0:31:42.890
very peculiar champion last year Mike

0:31:59.990,0:32:07.400

0:32:02.610,0:32:07.400
qualifier falling away they're all entry

0:32:07.490,0:32:28.740
but still scoring up 30 50 which is a

0:32:10.850,0:32:31.340
decent return 17 years of age he is

0:32:28.740,0:32:31.340

0:32:47.920,0:32:54.130
again he clawed two big bolts in that

0:32:51.630,0:32:55.750
3:9 series of the thief pretty low

0:32:54.130,0:32:59.680

0:32:55.750,0:33:00.700

from the women who've been the stronger

0:33:41.570,0:34:02.110
internationally 37.5 stare back won the

0:33:58.430,0:34:02.110
half somersault with half a twist

0:34:15.650,0:34:21.290
a little bit more movement in that dive

0:34:18.710,0:34:25.040
for the crowd to adjoint lives with a

0:34:21.290,0:34:27.170
twist and out we are reaching it's all

0:34:25.040,0:34:30.140
about swapping that rotation once you

0:34:27.170,0:34:32.989
get into the somersault flip tidally

0:34:30.140,0:34:36.010

0:34:40.280,0:34:47.500
50 points with her second dive did you

0:34:44.330,0:34:47.500
do this reverse tie

0:34:54.780,0:34:59.080
no coach was telling me that if she

0:34:57.280,0:35:04.619
could finish at the top six that would

0:34:59.080,0:35:04.619
be a very good return for her

0:35:06.640,0:35:10.180
looking out for the water there but not

0:35:08.800,0:35:14.620
really seeing the dive all the way

0:35:10.180,0:35:19.180
through the entry and down into six

0:35:14.620,0:35:23.740

0:35:19.180,0:35:27.670
her second dive 20 beans have about a

0:35:23.740,0:35:29.860

0:35:27.670,0:35:32.710

0:35:32.710,0:35:39.240
four dives which will count in the final

0:35:36.070,0:35:39.240

marks from 145 to 97

0:36:34.780,0:36:40.600
it's all about putting together a

0:36:37.090,0:36:42.460
program especially today with 8 dives to

0:36:40.600,0:36:47.530
get through 5 is the ball in senior

0:36:42.460,0:36:49.050

big mistakes

0:36:49.050,0:36:55.000
keeping the double bogeys off your card

0:36:51.810,0:36:59.740
to make a golfing analogy it's all about

0:36:55.000,0:37:02.470
consistency and then hopefully pulling

0:36:59.740,0:37:08.640
out the big points water really matters

0:48:59.910,0:49:05.340
the tiniest of high positions and a

1:27:00.090,1:27:03.650
good work because

1:27:06.020,1:27:10.520
going to have delayed rather quickly the

1:27:08.180,1:27:13.090
table because it always suggests great

1:27:10.520,1:27:13.090
control

1:27:17.820,1:27:25.450
just how it hard work to keep the

1:27:22.120,1:27:28.140
standards right through the eight rounds

1:27:25.450,1:27:28.140

1:28:41.110,1:28:44.670
this first session

1:28:46.750,1:28:54.640
plenty to whet the appetite then we have

1:28:50.800,1:28:57.580
seen some encouraging performances but

1:28:54.640,1:29:02.200
also just what a test it can be at this

1:28:57.580,1:29:04.590
Olympic level for young divers can they

1:29:02.200,1:29:08.980
deal with the pressure can they produce

1:29:04.590,1:29:10.840
their really best form maybe their

1:29:08.980,1:29:12.310
coaches and they themselves will find
