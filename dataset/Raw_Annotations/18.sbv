0:00:00.000,0:00:05.700
of in the final and there will be

0:00:02.700,0:00:08.840
representatives from the USA Germany

0:00:05.700,0:00:11.700
Ukraine and Canada Great Britain Spain

0:00:08.840,0:00:15.389
Australia and Malaysia and of course -

0:00:11.700,0:00:18.060
from Chinese as well in the competition

0:00:15.389,0:00:20.820
tonight it's gonna be a thrilling one

0:00:18.060,0:00:23.550
certainly if the previous two rounds are

0:00:20.820,0:00:25.439
anything to go by and then crown are

0:00:23.550,0:00:29.359
delighted after the introduction of

0:00:25.439,0:00:33.590
Xavier Garcia C rather unexpectedly

0:00:29.359,0:00:35.820
Chris Meers has made a throw to a final

0:00:33.590,0:00:37.890
preliminary she was the best they could

0:00:35.820,0:00:41.700
manage at the World Championships in

0:00:37.890,0:00:44.850
Shanghai last year this time round he's

0:00:41.700,0:00:46.920
gone to better and made it into the top

0:00:44.850,0:00:47.579
12 this man is very used to being in the

0:00:46.920,0:00:51.300
top 12

0:00:47.579,0:00:52.410
twice silver medalist at the Olympics in

0:00:51.300,0:00:57.210
this very event

0:00:52.410,0:00:59.850
Alexander Tea Party of Canada Ilya

0:00:57.210,0:01:02.399
Kumasi of Ukraine and will certainly be

0:00:59.850,0:01:04.979
in the mix as will this man all the

0:01:02.399,0:01:08.250
remaining divers being introduced will

0:01:04.979,0:01:11.159
be competing for probably a bronze maybe

0:01:08.250,0:01:13.650
a silver we have maybe a fly in the

0:01:11.159,0:01:15.330
ointment for the Chinese coming up in

0:01:13.650,0:01:18.240
just a moment we'll introduce him after

0:01:15.330,0:01:22.049
troy Dumais has been introduced to the

0:01:18.240,0:01:23.549
crowd there's a few divers who have been

0:01:22.049,0:01:25.350
diving exceptionally well and

0:01:23.549,0:01:31.290
consistently well - and here's one of

0:01:25.350,0:01:33.390
them the r Castillo who went up second

0:01:31.290,0:01:35.670
ranked of the Chinese after the semi

0:01:33.390,0:01:37.350
files is Qin Kai and it just missed out

0:01:35.670,0:01:39.979
on the medal at the World Championships

0:01:37.350,0:01:42.390
last year in fourth place but here's the

0:01:39.979,0:01:44.070
almost unknown quantity though we do

0:01:42.390,0:01:45.210
know what he can do silver medalist of

0:01:44.070,0:01:49.970
the world championship last year

0:01:45.210,0:01:52.759
separating out the Chinese Ilya Zakharov

0:01:49.970,0:01:55.150
but the red-hot favorite surely is the

0:01:52.759,0:01:59.770
world champion

0:01:55.150,0:02:02.470
Olympic champion no Xiang ready to do

0:01:59.770,0:02:04.960
battle once again with the eleven of the

0:02:02.470,0:02:07.630
divers it could be a very interesting

0:02:04.960,0:02:09.490
hour and a half or so very unpredictable

0:02:07.630,0:02:12.100
the first two rounds have been no reason

0:02:09.490,0:02:15.990
suspect that tonight may not be in a

0:02:12.100,0:02:19.780
similar vein alongside me the 2004

0:02:15.990,0:02:21.910
synchro ten meter silver medalist Leon

0:02:19.780,0:02:24.760
Taylor well we haven't been disappointed

0:02:21.910,0:02:26.860
so far and I think the state to get me

0:02:24.760,0:02:29.920
knocked up just a a bit I'll sue tonight

0:02:26.860,0:02:32.290
well this is what all the divers have

0:02:29.920,0:02:34.150
been aiming to do you've got to make it

0:02:32.290,0:02:36.850
through the preliminaries you've got to

0:02:34.150,0:02:38.560
make it through these semi finals and

0:02:36.850,0:02:40.540
this is where the work starts none of

0:02:38.560,0:02:43.900
the points carry through each of the

0:02:40.540,0:02:46.270
divers will be performing six dives the

0:02:43.900,0:02:47.260
most difficult dives humanly possible

0:02:46.270,0:02:49.720
they'll be going in different directions

0:02:47.260,0:02:52.180
there are five groups of dive there's

0:02:49.720,0:02:53.680
the forward the backwards there's also

0:02:52.180,0:02:55.390
the inward which is where you stand

0:02:53.680,0:02:56.890
backwards on your tiptoes but you jump

0:02:55.390,0:02:57.490
away from the diving board and spin

0:02:56.890,0:02:59.320
forward

0:02:57.490,0:03:01.630
there's the reverse which is where you

0:02:59.320,0:03:03.640
walk down the diving board jumping away

0:03:01.630,0:03:05.440
from it but spin backwards towards it

0:03:03.640,0:03:07.780
there's also the twist where you move

0:03:05.440,0:03:09.370
look at twisting longitude early as well

0:03:07.780,0:03:11.380
as fitting in somersaults and then you

0:03:09.370,0:03:13.360
get one dive that you can choose any one

0:03:11.380,0:03:15.850
of those five groups so what you're

0:03:13.360,0:03:17.530
gonna see today is well if their

0:03:15.850,0:03:21.700
freedoms and semi-finals are anything to

0:03:17.530,0:03:22.930
go by it's gonna be extraordinary as you

0:03:21.700,0:03:26.190
deal with those headphones on that

0:03:22.930,0:03:30.400
little baby they're almost as big as the

0:03:26.190,0:03:33.370
kid's head on to the judges these are

0:03:30.400,0:03:35.260
the ones who will have the destiny and

0:03:33.370,0:03:38.350
the outcome of the mainstream it's a

0:03:35.260,0:03:39.940
springboard in their hands would you

0:03:38.350,0:03:41.800
like me to explain the judging before we

0:03:39.940,0:03:45.010
kick off Bobby the judges explained

0:03:41.800,0:03:46.989
judging I can't explain the judges but I

0:03:45.010,0:03:48.910
will explain how the judging works in in

0:03:46.989,0:03:51.730
all individual contests so there are

0:03:48.910,0:03:55.810
seven execution judges who mark the

0:03:51.730,0:03:58.120
diver out of ten the two highest and two

0:03:55.810,0:03:59.410
lowest marks are then crossed off and

0:03:58.120,0:04:01.500
you will see those appear on your screen

0:03:59.410,0:04:04.840
with lines through them to leave three

0:04:01.500,0:04:07.540
roars those are then totaled multiplied

0:04:04.840,0:04:08.860
by the Associated degree of difficulty

0:04:07.540,0:04:11.290
to give the total

0:04:08.860,0:04:12.730
for that give and die or six totals are

0:04:11.290,0:04:16.150
added together to give the overall

0:04:12.730,0:04:17.980
placings right now we've marked your

0:04:16.150,0:04:19.299
card on how it works and what's likely

0:04:17.980,0:04:21.940
to happen in the next hour and a half

0:04:19.299,0:04:24.430
let's get on with the action and start

0:04:21.940,0:04:26.260
with the first round first round of six

0:04:24.430,0:04:31.150
remember five in the women's competition

0:04:26.260,0:04:33.850
six in the men's and just sneaking in

0:04:31.150,0:04:43.360
and they very final qualifying place

0:04:33.850,0:04:46.120
number 12 here's Ken yo 12 years he will

0:04:43.360,0:04:48.610
quit after these games only made the

0:04:46.120,0:04:50.650
preliminaries in Sydney in 2000 his

0:04:48.610,0:04:56.440
opening dive for three and a half summer

0:04:50.650,0:04:58.570
sorts with Pike oh if that's a sign of

0:04:56.440,0:04:59.050
what is to come we are in for a real

0:04:58.570,0:05:02.680
treat

0:04:59.050,0:05:04.870
Kenny yo starting with his forward three

0:05:02.680,0:05:06.790
and a half perfectly on the end of the

0:05:04.870,0:05:10.330
diving board squeezing into that Pike

0:05:06.790,0:05:12.340
shape slipping into the water without

0:05:10.330,0:05:16.210
very much splash that's a big opening

0:05:12.340,0:05:18.490
man died for him 88.5 incoming and a big

0:05:16.210,0:05:22.390
total score to start off his campaign in

0:05:18.490,0:05:31.960
this Olympic final for him seventy nine

0:05:22.390,0:05:33.970
point zero five Kenya now on to ethan

0:05:31.960,0:05:36.070
warren from australia only one

0:05:33.970,0:05:37.510
australian and she entered in this event

0:05:36.070,0:05:40.840
but he's made it through to the final

0:05:37.510,0:05:43.330
and he will go with a back two and a

0:05:40.840,0:05:46.510
half summer sorts with pike this time

0:05:43.330,0:05:49.150
not 3.1 but 3.0 degree of difficulty

0:05:46.510,0:05:55.090
which of course will be what the marks

0:05:49.150,0:05:58.120
he gets will be x oh it's pretty good

0:05:55.090,0:06:00.010
it's straight up and down he is well

0:05:58.120,0:06:01.830
that died was throwing up a little bit

0:06:00.010,0:06:04.750
too much splash for more than an eighth

0:06:01.830,0:06:07.390
which is a shame the aerial work is good

0:06:04.750,0:06:09.220
backwards there's the pike shape comes

0:06:07.390,0:06:11.890
out in plenty of time enters the water

0:06:09.220,0:06:13.450
it's good it'll get eights I'm short but

0:06:11.890,0:06:15.580
it needs to be clean him into the water

0:06:13.450,0:06:18.220
check out this super slow-mo shot here

0:06:15.580,0:06:20.950
as he exits the dive putting his chin

0:06:18.220,0:06:23.940
back to look at the water reaches back

0:06:20.950,0:06:26.560
it's pretty good just too much

0:06:23.940,0:06:29.139
yep happy enough it would seem with that

0:06:26.560,0:06:32.350
maybe a brave face on it but 72 is the

0:06:29.139,0:06:34.539
opening score for Ethan Warren 20

0:06:32.350,0:06:36.690
year-old from Australia goes into second

0:06:34.539,0:06:41.680
place for the time being

0:06:36.690,0:06:45.820
Xavier Garcia of Spain training in

0:06:41.680,0:06:52.090
Canada these days seventh in Rome 2009

0:06:45.820,0:06:53.830
and Nathan Shanghai a year ago now it's

0:06:52.090,0:06:57.130
really coming in to form these past few

0:06:53.830,0:06:58.360
years decided to train overseas and he's

0:06:57.130,0:06:59.979
certainly been working hard he's in

0:06:58.360,0:07:01.150
great shape he used to be a little

0:06:59.979,0:07:03.820
heavier than that but he's obviously

0:07:01.150,0:07:06.190
working with a fantastic team in Canada

0:07:03.820,0:07:08.860
teammate of Alexander de Partie or he'll

0:07:06.190,0:07:10.479
be up soon that could squeeze eight from

0:07:08.860,0:07:13.960
the judges he's clean him into the water

0:07:10.479,0:07:16.930
than Ethan before him again 3.0 dd

0:07:13.960,0:07:22.349
couple of eights and 7.5 to give him a

0:07:16.930,0:07:25.169
total when you 7.50

0:07:22.349,0:07:28.300
this man's have a great couple of days

0:07:25.169,0:07:30.760
well the boy became a man right before

0:07:28.300,0:07:35.099
the eyes of the Aquatic Centre in London

0:07:30.760,0:07:37.330
Britain's Chris Meers his opening dive

0:07:35.099,0:07:40.949
easier once he'll do it's all relative

0:07:37.330,0:07:49.630
of course 3.0 degree of difficulty

0:07:40.949,0:07:52.330
starting dive he looks pretty steady

0:07:49.630,0:07:54.099
again and the crowd of enjoying that

0:07:52.330,0:07:55.630
ripping the roof off there's his mum and

0:07:54.099,0:07:57.720
dad and the rest of his family holding

0:07:55.630,0:08:00.550
up the tents that's only gonna get ate

0:07:57.720,0:08:02.440
but there we go smiling before he sets

0:08:00.550,0:08:04.449
off you've got to use this crowd you

0:08:02.440,0:08:06.970
can't block it Ike you've got a smile

0:08:04.449,0:08:09.340
rise to the occasion exactly what he did

0:08:06.970,0:08:12.070
in the semi-finals and that's a lovely

0:08:09.340,0:08:17.320
star it'll get over 70 points it's good

0:08:12.070,0:08:18.740
enough yeah it's alright 72 is what we

0:08:17.320,0:08:23.180
anticipate 72 is

0:08:18.740,0:08:25.099
we get we're 3/8 multiply the course by

0:08:23.180,0:08:27.169
the degree of difficulty giving you 72

0:08:25.099,0:08:30.910
and that's not tip nicely into equal

0:08:27.169,0:08:34.399
second at the moment Alexander de Partie

0:08:30.910,0:08:37.339
again it's a three point zero it's the

0:08:34.399,0:08:45.500
back at two and a half in the pike

0:08:37.339,0:08:47.660
position yeah

0:08:45.500,0:08:50.899
silver medalist four years ago silver

0:08:47.660,0:08:53.450
medalist back in 2004 fourth Olympic

0:08:50.899,0:08:54.560
Games truly exceptional athlete been

0:08:53.450,0:08:56.060
through the middle in the build-up to

0:08:54.560,0:08:58.010
this one plenty of injuries we're talk

0:08:56.060,0:08:59.480
more about that later that's not the

0:08:58.010,0:09:01.100
start that Alex would be looking for

0:08:59.480,0:09:03.380
just tipping over a vertical as he

0:09:01.100,0:09:05.750
enters the water that may be trying a

0:09:03.380,0:09:11.209
little bit too hard technically so

0:09:05.750,0:09:13.100
proficient such an elegant diver just a

0:09:11.209,0:09:15.980
shame they're a little bit off I wonder

0:09:13.100,0:09:19.910
whether he can bounce back well it's

0:09:15.980,0:09:22.029
racing your way as ever proposes

0:09:19.910,0:09:24.709
thoughts get himself ready for round two

0:09:22.029,0:09:28.450
72 is the score for de Partie which

0:09:24.709,0:09:31.339
matches Mears and Warren in round one

0:09:28.450,0:09:33.529
Illya Vasa with all that tape on his

0:09:31.339,0:09:35.390
back you know when we get a moment we'll

0:09:33.529,0:09:35.810
explain exactly what's holding him

0:09:35.390,0:09:39.770
together

0:09:35.810,0:09:41.510
is it superglue 3.24 is his opening

0:09:39.770,0:09:43.850
gambit in with three and a half summer

0:09:41.510,0:09:47.329
sorts with tuck so a big degree of

0:09:43.850,0:09:49.250
difficulty to start with oh it always

0:09:47.329,0:09:51.410
makes the crowds take a little bit of an

0:09:49.250,0:09:53.000
intake of air because the inward

0:09:51.410,0:09:54.860
movement is the one where you are

0:09:53.000,0:09:57.110
relatively close to the diving board

0:09:54.860,0:09:59.600
standing backwards spinning forward

0:09:57.110,0:10:01.940
kibosh is actually for me a little bit

0:09:59.600,0:10:04.130
too tight to the diving board and he

0:10:01.940,0:10:05.570
seemed going by he does a good job on at

0:10:04.130,0:10:08.899
Lee and his three point four degree of

0:10:05.570,0:10:12.649
difficulty so it will score a relatively

0:10:08.899,0:10:15.410
good total points but the execution he's

0:10:12.649,0:10:17.690
tipping over a vertical there as he goes

0:10:15.410,0:10:19.250
in yeah a little bit too close to the

0:10:17.690,0:10:20.779
board for me the tape will hold him

0:10:19.250,0:10:22.030
together that's his lower back injury

0:10:20.779,0:10:24.160
has

0:10:22.030,0:10:26.050
more or less matching what he did in the

0:10:24.160,0:10:29.020
semi-finals seventy eight point two zero

0:10:26.050,0:10:31.060
for kavaja will lift him because that

0:10:29.020,0:10:31.800
higher degree of difficulty into second

0:10:31.060,0:10:35.260
place

0:10:31.800,0:10:38.140
Patrick housing of Germany not quite so

0:10:35.260,0:10:40.780
ambitious with his opening dive is a 3.0

0:10:38.140,0:10:42.760
and you've seen it before it's that back

0:10:40.780,0:10:48.520
two and a half summer sorts with hike

0:10:42.760,0:10:50.230
oh what a dive that is the best executed

0:10:48.520,0:10:51.780
dive we've seen so far in this

0:10:50.230,0:10:53.890
competition we are in the early stages

0:10:51.780,0:10:55.960
but what you're looking for here is

0:10:53.890,0:10:58.500
great elevation from the diving board

0:10:55.960,0:11:02.260
beautiful Pike shape and he absolutely

0:10:58.500,0:11:04.720
cruises it slipping into the water with

0:11:02.260,0:11:06.880
absolutely no splash eight point five s

0:11:04.720,0:11:09.580
I think it's worth a nine let's see what

0:11:06.880,0:11:11.620
the judges think well for once the

0:11:09.580,0:11:13.330
judges to sakru de Leon Taylor they're

0:11:11.620,0:11:15.850
not gonna have any of that eight point

0:11:13.330,0:11:18.610
five it is across the board near the

0:11:15.850,0:11:23.770
marks the count seven six point five

0:11:18.610,0:11:29.050
zero only one American remains in the

0:11:23.770,0:11:32.890
lineup problems just cool earlier in the

0:11:29.050,0:11:35.440
competition this is Troy do mate three

0:11:32.890,0:11:39.120
point one open for him forward three and

0:11:35.440,0:11:42.940
a half somersaults in the position oh

0:11:39.120,0:11:44.620
look at that entry well sometimes

0:11:42.940,0:11:46.660
thinking that no one actually went in

0:11:44.620,0:11:48.760
there is not enough splash to fill a tea

0:11:46.660,0:11:51.640
cup because I've heard said many times

0:11:48.760,0:11:54.250
before Troy to may is certainly on fire

0:11:51.640,0:11:56.770
bonds medalist already this is going to

0:11:54.250,0:12:00.460
get nines well definitely should get

0:11:56.770,0:12:03.520
nine should be all over it look at that

0:12:00.460,0:12:05.620
precision almost perfection just a

0:12:03.520,0:12:07.120
little bit low on the water needs to be

0:12:05.620,0:12:09.130
a little bit higher in my opinion for

0:12:07.120,0:12:13.510
nine point five so maybe Anil even the

0:12:09.130,0:12:15.820
elusive ten throwing down the proverbial

0:12:13.510,0:12:18.870
gauntlet isn't it lines across the board

0:12:15.820,0:12:25.240
eighty three point seven zero with that

0:12:18.870,0:12:27.040
degree of difficulty now it's do Mexico

0:12:25.240,0:12:28.720
forward two and a half seven sorts to

0:12:27.040,0:12:30.240
twist three point four degree of

0:12:28.720,0:12:32.519
difficulty

0:12:30.240,0:12:34.949
or the cried like that because there's a

0:12:32.519,0:12:36.269
lot going on so that's the forward two

0:12:34.949,0:12:38.100
and a half with two twists you'll see a

0:12:36.269,0:12:40.019
lot of the athletes using this yell game

0:12:38.100,0:12:42.179
of tactics coming out with his big guns

0:12:40.019,0:12:43.529
three point four here we are here's one

0:12:42.179,0:12:45.449
and a half somersault so actually one

0:12:43.529,0:12:47.699
then he comes out double twist he's a

0:12:45.449,0:12:49.110
little bit stuck there so he does get it

0:12:47.699,0:12:50.730
in it lands on his head

0:12:49.110,0:12:52.889
it'll get eights and eight point five

0:12:50.730,0:12:55.439
look at the expression on his face as he

0:12:52.889,0:12:57.839
goes into the double twist he's been on

0:12:55.439,0:13:00.240
fire yesterday and today and he

0:12:57.839,0:13:02.910
continues to like the blue touch paper

0:13:00.240,0:13:04.740
yeah he's been the early leader on both

0:13:02.910,0:13:06.720
occasions both in the preliminaries and

0:13:04.740,0:13:08.999
now 70 files and could well be the

0:13:06.720,0:13:11.850
leader of the first round here with that

0:13:08.999,0:13:14.189
eighty six point seven zero on to the

0:13:11.850,0:13:15.839
first of the two Chinese this is the one

0:13:14.189,0:13:20.209
that missed out on a medal at the World

0:13:15.839,0:13:21.329
Championships in Shanghai last summer

0:13:20.209,0:13:23.369
yes

0:13:21.329,0:13:25.619
King Kai's back two and a half

0:13:23.369,0:13:30.420
somersaults 3.0 you've seen it before

0:13:25.619,0:13:35.339
comes again that's more like it punching

0:13:30.420,0:13:36.990
kite back two and a half opting to open

0:13:35.339,0:13:39.179
with this easiest dive now some of the

0:13:36.990,0:13:40.889
divers aren't so it gives an unfair look

0:13:39.179,0:13:43.769
at the scoreboard because that's a

0:13:40.889,0:13:45.600
beautiful dive just saving as he goes

0:13:43.769,0:13:47.009
into bending at the hips actually

0:13:45.600,0:13:48.839
arching of the lower back and bending at

0:13:47.009,0:13:50.519
the knees to try and stop the dive from

0:13:48.839,0:13:52.529
going over a vertical which he does a

0:13:50.519,0:13:54.540
very very good job on if he gets 80

0:13:52.529,0:13:57.480
points on this it's a job well done

0:13:54.540,0:13:59.429
80 and more 81 points of Ching Kai

0:13:57.480,0:14:04.319
we're three nines counting towards our

0:13:59.429,0:14:08.160
total we see one diver

0:14:04.319,0:14:10.649
go above a hundred marks this is he

0:14:08.160,0:14:14.670
India's Acker off it came in the final

0:14:10.649,0:14:16.740
round of the semi final this morning so

0:14:14.670,0:14:18.240
expensive early on birds well three

0:14:16.740,0:14:19.619
point eight it's a three point four in

0:14:18.240,0:14:20.900
with three and a half seven sort with

0:14:19.619,0:14:23.270
tuck

0:14:20.900,0:14:25.130
or he means business this afternoon he

0:14:23.270,0:14:29.180
was a bit shaky in the semi-final he was

0:14:25.130,0:14:32.110
top qualifier for the semi-final now has

0:14:29.180,0:14:35.480
a demeanor of the great Dmitri sighting

0:14:32.110,0:14:37.700
canny emulate him can he win Olympic

0:14:35.480,0:14:40.029
gold today if he continues to dive like

0:14:37.700,0:14:43.130
this he'll certainly be in contention

0:14:40.029,0:14:45.260
88.5 incoming for this amazing dive

0:14:43.130,0:14:47.089
three point for putting the pressure on

0:14:45.260,0:14:49.370
the Olympic champion who's up next

0:14:47.089,0:14:52.010
six points better than the most in the

0:14:49.370,0:14:55.130
semi files earlier today's a crop 85

0:14:52.010,0:15:00.320
just buying Castillo Puerta just ahead

0:14:55.130,0:15:02.660
are Troy do Mei Chong world champion

0:15:00.320,0:15:06.040
Olympic champion three World Series wins

0:15:02.660,0:15:11.230
this year in Moscow Beijing and Dubai

0:15:06.040,0:15:14.660
again dive its favored by many of

0:15:11.230,0:15:19.990
finalists is that back two and a half

0:15:14.660,0:15:19.990
somersault again Pike position 3.0 oh

0:15:22.810,0:15:27.800
it's not as good as you would expect

0:15:26.029,0:15:29.180
from the Olympic champion you can see

0:15:27.800,0:15:31.940
his teammates they're just giving him

0:15:29.180,0:15:33.620
polite applause rather than standing up

0:15:31.940,0:15:35.330
and whooping and hollering the aerial

0:15:33.620,0:15:37.580
work is exceptional is way above the

0:15:35.330,0:15:39.380
five meter he's super flash putting his

0:15:37.580,0:15:41.480
feet right down at the water cruising

0:15:39.380,0:15:43.160
round but he goes over a vertical I

0:15:41.480,0:15:46.910
don't think that's worth more than seven

0:15:43.160,0:15:57.529
point five eight maybe and he chung is

0:15:46.910,0:16:00.709
off the pace competition on 8.0

0:15:57.529,0:16:04.610
right across the board times the degree

0:16:00.709,0:16:10.130
of difficulty will put him in the top

0:16:04.610,0:16:12.140
eight that's how things look after the

0:16:10.130,0:16:15.140
first round of dives a long way to go

0:16:12.140,0:16:17.630
yet five more rounds remember Castillo

0:16:15.140,0:16:21.830
wet again leading the way early stages

0:16:17.630,0:16:24.550
Sakharov Dumais Ching Kai

0:16:21.830,0:16:28.430
a commercial last name on that screen

0:16:24.550,0:16:30.650
then de Partie nochang and Chris Meers

0:16:28.430,0:16:32.810
all with the same score as has Ethan

0:16:30.650,0:16:35.450
Warren and slightly tailed off but not

0:16:32.810,0:16:44.450
too much as Xavier Garcia after round

0:16:35.450,0:16:46.820
number one aren't around to front of a

0:16:44.450,0:16:49.520
expectant crowd a very noisy crowd a

0:16:46.820,0:16:51.290
very enthused crowd who won't see the

0:16:49.520,0:16:52.610
best diving and that's exactly what

0:16:51.290,0:16:56.780
they're going to do in this Olympic

0:16:52.610,0:17:02.560
final of the 3-meter springboard in the

0:16:56.780,0:17:07.730
yo its first ever final at the Olympics

0:17:02.560,0:17:09.640
two twists no he's done okay his takeoff

0:17:07.730,0:17:11.810
just letting him down a little bit

0:17:09.640,0:17:13.940
capturing all the footage to coach his

0:17:11.810,0:17:16.130
using the tablets there to instantly

0:17:13.940,0:17:17.810
capture the dive just a little bit back

0:17:16.130,0:17:19.400
from the end of the diving board so when

0:17:17.810,0:17:21.470
he comes out into his double twist here

0:17:19.400,0:17:23.570
he's falling a little bit too quickly

0:17:21.470,0:17:26.420
and so it runs out of room a little bit

0:17:23.570,0:17:30.800
it's still good I'm sure it'll go over

0:17:26.420,0:17:33.460
75 7008 which is a good dive but Wow

0:17:30.800,0:17:35.780
you know this is the Olympic final

0:17:33.460,0:17:37.490
seventy eight point two zero and good

0:17:35.780,0:17:43.790
see the coaches reading the instructions

0:17:37.490,0:17:47.990
take tablets with water very good on to

0:17:43.790,0:17:49.610
the Australian Ethan Warren equal eight

0:17:47.990,0:17:51.380
after the first bit of pro doesn't mean

0:17:49.610,0:17:53.120
an awful lot at this stage for three and

0:17:51.380,0:17:55.100
a half seven sorts with Pike's slightly

0:17:53.120,0:17:57.050
moving up in terms of degree of

0:17:55.100,0:18:01.270
difficulty three point one this time so

0:17:57.050,0:18:04.580
three point zero well it's pretty good

0:18:01.270,0:18:06.230
end of the dive short of vertical

0:18:04.580,0:18:08.240
there's Matthew Mitchum Olympic champion

0:18:06.230,0:18:11.000
from Australia on the platform whistling

0:18:08.240,0:18:13.550
and cheering he's 20 year old teammate

0:18:11.000,0:18:14.810
on it's a fantastic job to get this

0:18:13.550,0:18:16.370
fight just comes out the time a little

0:18:14.810,0:18:19.130
bit early they're leaving it short as he

0:18:16.370,0:18:20.540
entered the water so he won't go over 70

0:18:19.130,0:18:23.330
points on that and that'll leave him off

0:18:20.540,0:18:25.160
the pace already at these early stages

0:18:23.330,0:18:26.810
but I didn't expect him to be in the top

0:18:25.160,0:18:28.250
six there we go that's fresh and says it

0:18:26.810,0:18:29.940
or doesn't it I love it because you know

0:18:28.250,0:18:31.860
exactly what he thinks about dive

0:18:29.940,0:18:35.070
he doesn't hide his expressions or his

0:18:31.860,0:18:36.389
emotions even those thumbs up in a smile

0:18:35.070,0:18:38.610
to follow but I think the initial

0:18:36.389,0:18:39.000
expression told you what you need to

0:18:38.610,0:18:41.580
know

0:18:39.000,0:18:45.840
Xavier Garcia for two and a half two

0:18:41.580,0:18:48.090
twists oh that's a really really good

0:18:45.840,0:18:49.470
dive now I'm not sure what the judges

0:18:48.090,0:18:51.389
are going to make of it he did move

0:18:49.470,0:18:53.159
towards us here in the commentary box

0:18:51.389,0:18:56.970
quite a lot which gives the impression

0:18:53.159,0:18:59.789
that the dive is dare I say skew if here

0:18:56.970,0:19:01.379
we go he's spinning towards us loses her

0:18:59.789,0:19:03.570
legs a little bit the entry into the

0:19:01.379,0:19:06.389
water is superb but you can see he's

0:19:03.570,0:19:08.159
moving towards us now if the judges spot

0:19:06.389,0:19:10.080
that they might penalize him if they

0:19:08.159,0:19:14.210
don't spot it he's going to get a big

0:19:10.080,0:19:14.210
big score here he comes

0:19:14.330,0:19:20.399
lovely entry into the water which the

0:19:17.850,0:19:22.139
judges have spotted today's body is

0:19:20.399,0:19:22.649
going a little bit erroneous halfway

0:19:22.139,0:19:26.220
through

0:19:22.649,0:19:28.500
no thanks point seven zero takes him

0:19:26.220,0:19:30.990
into second place now the huge roar you

0:19:28.500,0:19:33.059
heard not surprisingly to greet the

0:19:30.990,0:19:35.509
arrival of Great Britain's crispy is

0:19:33.059,0:19:42.269
second round dive reverse two and a half

0:19:35.509,0:19:44.580
somersaults he's just let the tide go

0:19:42.269,0:19:47.070
over he's obviously pumped full of

0:19:44.580,0:19:48.330
adrenaline you see those coach on the

0:19:47.070,0:19:51.389
Left Lindsey Fraser

0:19:48.330,0:19:53.549
he knows you get instant feedback yes

0:19:51.389,0:19:55.259
toes over the end he was hanging ten so

0:19:53.549,0:19:56.820
he did well to wait then he thought he

0:19:55.259,0:20:00.120
was spinning slower than he was but he's

0:19:56.820,0:20:02.789
way up in the air over a vertical a

0:20:00.120,0:20:06.330
little bit of a timber that's actually a

0:20:02.789,0:20:10.470
bit of a blown dive there for Chris such

0:20:06.330,0:20:12.029
a shame he did all the hard work yeah it

0:20:10.470,0:20:13.260
dropped a few too many points they were

0:20:12.029,0:20:15.179
afraid

0:20:13.260,0:20:19.559
not comparable with what he did earlier

0:20:15.179,0:20:21.150
today 58.50 for Chris Meers now I'll put

0:20:19.559,0:20:25.049
him at the bottom of the pack of those

0:20:21.150,0:20:26.580
who have gone that so far Alexandre de

0:20:25.049,0:20:28.320
Partie reversed two and a half

0:20:26.580,0:20:32.309
somersaults one and a half twists in the

0:20:28.320,0:20:33.960
pike position 3.30 it's done really well

0:20:32.309,0:20:36.660
way back from the end of the diving

0:20:33.960,0:20:39.299
board such a shame because if alex is on

0:20:36.660,0:20:40.919
the end of the diving board this dive is

0:20:39.299,0:20:42.150
all his but that it could see him

0:20:40.919,0:20:44.400
shaking his head as he gets like because

0:20:42.150,0:20:45.809
it's so difficult you've got a jump you

0:20:44.400,0:20:47.910
know forwards and then spin backwards

0:20:45.809,0:20:49.730
towards it one and a half twist two and

0:20:47.910,0:20:53.130
a half somersault it might squeeze eight

0:20:49.730,0:20:54.870
but I would expect to see 9s from Alex

0:20:53.130,0:20:56.970
if he wants to stay in the hunt for that

0:20:54.870,0:20:58.650
third Olympic medal on the banks in this

0:20:56.970,0:20:58.919
event gonna be tough out there for him

0:20:58.650,0:21:01.169
today

0:20:58.919,0:21:03.720
well a couple of judges quite liked it

0:21:01.169,0:21:06.210
one judge will get the line through

0:21:03.720,0:21:08.190
eight point five will count towards the

0:21:06.210,0:21:12.030
total of 80 points

0:21:08.190,0:21:18.809
eighty-five Alexandre de Partie now

0:21:12.030,0:21:21.450
Anika vasha some problems it's a big in

0:21:18.809,0:21:24.260
its forward four and a half somersaults

0:21:21.450,0:21:27.120
with tuck 3.8 into the big Terrace early

0:21:24.260,0:21:28.530
or you can say you can say well I think

0:21:27.120,0:21:30.030
that might have been your fault Bob

0:21:28.530,0:21:33.090
you said it could causing some problems

0:21:30.030,0:21:35.370
and right on cue the problem started the

0:21:33.090,0:21:37.410
take-off on this is so so important he's

0:21:35.370,0:21:39.690
on the corner of the diving board means

0:21:37.410,0:21:41.880
he can't push down with confidence for

0:21:39.690,0:21:44.250
he's lacking height lacking rotation and

0:21:41.880,0:21:46.169
running out of room he needed a 3.5

0:21:44.250,0:21:49.290
meter springboard see him invite on the

0:21:46.169,0:21:51.480
corner left-hand corner of the board Wow

0:21:49.290,0:21:54.270
kibosh off the pace as well yeah that's

0:21:51.480,0:21:58.140
his big dive blown I'm afraid in terms

0:21:54.270,0:22:00.059
of spread on the marks they're 4.5 up to

0:21:58.140,0:22:02.490
6 they saw it slightly differently for a

0:22:00.059,0:22:04.500
judging perspective the marks aren't

0:22:02.490,0:22:07.559
overly impressive for a high tariff dive

0:22:04.500,0:22:09.780
sixty eight point four zero on to the

0:22:07.559,0:22:13.580
remaining German Patrick housing for

0:22:09.780,0:22:13.580
three and a half three point one with

0:22:14.139,0:22:21.379
technically exceptionally good maybe a

0:22:19.700,0:22:22.639
little bit of a turn as he went into the

0:22:21.379,0:22:25.179
water there I don't know but the judges

0:22:22.639,0:22:27.379
will spot that let's have a look

0:22:25.179,0:22:30.740
spotting the water spotting the water

0:22:27.379,0:22:32.749
there he goes it comes in yes I can see

0:22:30.740,0:22:35.179
both feet slightly there it shows me an

0:22:32.749,0:22:36.769
over twist but I think the judges might

0:22:35.179,0:22:39.440
not see that or they tend to be letting

0:22:36.769,0:22:41.929
those go a little bit still there's a

0:22:39.440,0:22:43.700
very good dive looking over to the coach

0:22:41.929,0:22:45.139
for instant feedback was that okay

0:22:43.700,0:22:47.179
your might little bit over yeah I can

0:22:45.139,0:22:47.600
feel going over just a touch there you

0:22:47.179,0:22:50.059
go

0:22:47.600,0:22:52.070
is there an argument having judges

0:22:50.059,0:22:54.860
straight on as well as on the side as

0:22:52.070,0:22:57.289
well so he could get a vision of that or

0:22:54.860,0:22:59.200
a view of that no the judges always been

0:22:57.289,0:23:03.039
from the side it's kind of keep that

0:22:59.200,0:23:05.629
stability okay

0:23:03.039,0:23:07.519
Troy doom a reverse two and a half

0:23:05.629,0:23:09.639
somersaults one half twist three point

0:23:07.519,0:23:12.980
three in the pike position

0:23:09.639,0:23:15.230
well not quite as clean into the water

0:23:12.980,0:23:18.200
as his first round dive but not far away

0:23:15.230,0:23:20.990
at all yeah Steve Foley their high

0:23:18.200,0:23:23.029
performance director for USA moved away

0:23:20.990,0:23:24.830
from the UK and has been working out

0:23:23.029,0:23:26.860
there and look at this multiple medals

0:23:24.830,0:23:29.480
for USA diving in Troy to may is

0:23:26.860,0:23:32.210
certainly in contention so far that's a

0:23:29.480,0:23:35.389
big opening dive backed up straight away

0:23:32.210,0:23:37.759
with a very good second-round reverse

0:23:35.389,0:23:39.470
one off just in to and off 84 yeah

0:23:37.759,0:23:41.600
improvement on this morning as well as

0:23:39.470,0:23:43.610
indeed both dives have been he's

0:23:41.600,0:23:48.970
definitely in the credit column with an

0:23:43.610,0:23:53.720
84 point one five for Troy Dumais now

0:23:48.970,0:23:55.700
welter of Mexico getting into the reason

0:23:53.720,0:23:58.700
behind three point eight most of those

0:23:55.700,0:24:00.230
come late on in the other programs in

0:23:58.700,0:24:04.009
with three and a half somersaults with

0:24:00.230,0:24:08.960
tuck 3.44 Castillo who was the current

0:24:04.009,0:24:10.249
leader Oh sounded like it was a women's

0:24:08.960,0:24:12.110
tennis match there a little bit of

0:24:10.249,0:24:14.450
grunting and groaning but it seemed to

0:24:12.110,0:24:16.100
work for him swing in his arms

0:24:14.450,0:24:17.840
depressing the diving board being

0:24:16.100,0:24:20.360
patient waiting for the diving board to

0:24:17.840,0:24:22.850
throw him back up up up and away

0:24:20.360,0:24:24.500
he's only very short when he gets in

0:24:22.850,0:24:25.100
that shape he spins around like a

0:24:24.500,0:24:27.200
dingbat

0:24:25.100,0:24:29.659
if you think about spins around anyway

0:24:27.200,0:24:31.279
he goes zipping into the water with

0:24:29.659,0:24:35.029
hardly any splash and that's her eighty

0:24:31.279,0:24:37.360
point 85 dawn yeah I don't think David

0:24:35.029,0:24:40.789
that wasn't any danger quite frankly

0:24:37.360,0:24:43.269
last comment 85 from Castillo Wednesday

0:24:40.789,0:24:47.779
and it keeps him in the first place

0:24:43.269,0:24:49.909
Qin Kai our China forward two and a half

0:24:47.779,0:24:52.010
somersaults two twists Pike position

0:24:49.909,0:24:57.740
three point four on the degree of

0:24:52.010,0:24:59.860
difficulty or steady unfaltering an

0:24:57.740,0:25:03.559
unwavering so far we see Ching Kai

0:24:59.860,0:25:04.970
wobbling around a little bit in the

0:25:03.559,0:25:06.980
premiums in the semi as he seems pretty

0:25:04.970,0:25:09.139
steady so far a little bit corner board

0:25:06.980,0:25:10.779
there and he comes out forward two and

0:25:09.139,0:25:13.190
half two twists it's three point four

0:25:10.779,0:25:16.610
needed to be good and that's certainly

0:25:13.190,0:25:18.350
good really be catching up with the

0:25:16.610,0:25:21.350
Mexicans lead I think you'd be closing

0:25:18.350,0:25:23.120
it just marginally still a way to go yet

0:25:21.350,0:25:24.620
yeah he is closing but it hasn't quite

0:25:23.120,0:25:28.059
reached it yet and they're still

0:25:24.620,0:25:32.389
slightly behind Troy do me but only by

0:25:28.059,0:25:34.220
0.15 of a point and that puts the

0:25:32.389,0:25:37.899
Chinese the first of the two Chinese

0:25:34.220,0:25:41.210
into third place in Lea's zakharov

0:25:37.899,0:25:43.730
second after the first round he's got a

0:25:41.210,0:25:45.260
big dive to finish off the program with

0:25:43.730,0:25:50.480
this one not quite so big with picking

0:25:45.260,0:25:52.010
our 3.50 on and nailed it this is

0:25:50.480,0:25:54.620
actually very impressive because he's

0:25:52.010,0:25:56.809
the only diver actually up in the ante

0:25:54.620,0:25:58.789
the backward group of dyes all of the

0:25:56.809,0:25:59.899
others in this final are doing a back

0:25:58.789,0:26:03.350
two and a half in the pike position

0:25:59.899,0:26:06.080
playing safe with a 3-0 zakharov is

0:26:03.350,0:26:09.139
going all guns blazing this is three

0:26:06.080,0:26:11.899
point five degree of difficulty and he's

0:26:09.139,0:26:14.000
absolutely drilled it this is going to

0:26:11.899,0:26:17.299
sail over 80 points the Gamble has paid

0:26:14.000,0:26:19.880
off and the pressure lands firmly on the

0:26:17.299,0:26:22.039
next divers shoulders now remember we

0:26:19.880,0:26:24.169
haven't seen any tens that count yet I

0:26:22.039,0:26:27.620
think we might well do in the final yeah

0:26:24.169,0:26:32.990
91 that's decisive that is a decisive

0:26:27.620,0:26:34.639
die from zakharov 38.5 x the degree of

0:26:32.990,0:26:38.480
difficulty that's how you arrive with

0:26:34.639,0:26:40.210
that figure it's actually 13 points

0:26:38.480,0:26:43.840
higher than need to get and

0:26:40.210,0:26:48.340
today that's massive now her Chong has

0:26:43.840,0:26:49.860
responded oh he doesn't respond but not

0:26:48.340,0:26:52.029
in the way that he would have liked to

0:26:49.860,0:26:53.889
I'm not sure what the taping on the

0:26:52.029,0:26:55.539
fingers is those of you that are asking

0:26:53.889,0:26:57.159
it's peculiar normally see it on the

0:26:55.539,0:26:59.740
toes because the board's quite abrasive

0:26:57.159,0:27:01.659
now he Chong here really given it some

0:26:59.740,0:27:04.570
beans look at him way above the sitter

0:27:01.659,0:27:06.970
5-meter almost as high as a 7.5 million

0:27:04.570,0:27:09.249
but he goes over he over cooks it if you

0:27:06.970,0:27:11.710
will look at him can't even stop it's so

0:27:09.249,0:27:12.970
easy for him to adjust his soup but he

0:27:11.710,0:27:16.299
went in there which shows he was going

0:27:12.970,0:27:18.220
over a rotation all 8 it's good but it's

0:27:16.299,0:27:20.740
not good enough to take the lead

0:27:18.220,0:27:23.549
well he only puts him in 7th place with

0:27:20.740,0:27:26.289
someone from where he was good but

0:27:23.549,0:27:28.809
there's a man of the moment and the man

0:27:26.289,0:27:32.169
at the top of the standings Ilya

0:27:28.809,0:27:35.499
Zakharov from Russia has a bout a 5

0:27:32.169,0:27:37.659
point lead well they're about over young

0:27:35.499,0:27:41.200
Castillo went up there troy do mate

0:27:37.659,0:27:43.389
Ching Kai and yo good start from him and

0:27:41.200,0:27:47.590
Xavier Garcia has moved off the bottom

0:27:43.389,0:27:49.869
in the 6th and here come the remaining

0:27:47.590,0:27:52.289
divers Chris Meers about 10 points

0:27:49.869,0:27:55.210
adrift of Ethan Warren in 12th place

0:27:52.289,0:27:57.460
look at her chong world champion in

0:27:55.210,0:27:59.379
seventh after two rounds defending

0:27:57.460,0:28:01.269
Olympic champion as well of course so he

0:27:59.379,0:28:03.610
knows what it's like to stand on that

0:28:01.269,0:28:05.590
podium to win a gold at the Olympic

0:28:03.610,0:28:07.929
Games but Sakharov he's your man at the

0:28:05.590,0:28:10.269
moment and believe you me he's got some

0:28:07.929,0:28:14.499
big big dives to come will they catch

0:28:10.269,0:28:17.200
him exciting stuff as we head into round

0:28:14.499,0:28:20.649
3 six rounds in total so this will

0:28:17.200,0:28:24.970
represent halfway my time all 12 divers

0:28:20.649,0:28:26.799
have gone and yo in fifth place after

0:28:24.970,0:28:31.960
round 2 reversed two and a half with

0:28:26.799,0:28:33.549
pike dive go over as he went in just I

0:28:31.960,0:28:35.320
think he might have felt a little bit

0:28:33.549,0:28:38.200
tight to the diving board so he stayed

0:28:35.320,0:28:40.360
in his Pike shape a fraction too long he

0:28:38.200,0:28:42.730
go he's not too far away from the diving

0:28:40.360,0:28:45.309
board so yeah as he reaches back all

0:28:42.730,0:28:48.039
over there he comes to splash going back

0:28:45.309,0:28:51.690
towards the diving board not quite time

0:28:48.039,0:28:51.690
to get your surfboards out but nearly

0:28:51.790,0:28:58.790
yeah mistimed entry spotted of course by

0:28:54.950,0:29:00.890
the judges and e- 5.5 is where he gets

0:28:58.790,0:29:02.840
across the board so less than fifty

0:29:00.890,0:29:05.300
forty nine point five zero in a very

0:29:02.840,0:29:06.770
good start has come to a rather abrupt

0:29:05.300,0:29:08.570
end now we're into the three point eight

0:29:06.770,0:29:11.210
again ether more on going for an in

0:29:08.570,0:29:13.850
round three forward four-and-a-half

0:29:11.210,0:29:14.510
seller sorts with tuck big degree of

0:29:13.850,0:29:18.080
difficulty

0:29:14.510,0:29:23.900
obviously assigned to that a big risk it

0:29:18.080,0:29:25.850
comes off looks great oh it does to the

0:29:23.900,0:29:27.890
Gamble's paying off there's his

0:29:25.850,0:29:29.900
teammates on their feet the coaches are

0:29:27.890,0:29:31.730
even impressed that must mean it's good

0:29:29.900,0:29:33.620
three point eight this is his biggest

0:29:31.730,0:29:35.260
degree of difficulty almost on the end

0:29:33.620,0:29:37.670
of the diving board waits patiently

0:29:35.260,0:29:39.890
throws in and close himself up in the

0:29:37.670,0:29:42.230
air just spotting the water as he goes

0:29:39.890,0:29:42.770
in that's great will it get over 90

0:29:42.230,0:29:45.110
points

0:29:42.770,0:29:47.150
that's the question three point eight to

0:29:45.110,0:29:49.010
create difficulties so impressed with

0:29:47.150,0:29:52.640
these divers twenty years old from

0:29:49.010,0:29:55.520
Australia weekend the scores

0:29:52.640,0:29:58.400
yeah ninety one point two zero high

0:29:55.520,0:30:00.110
score in the competition so far for

0:29:58.400,0:30:02.840
Ethan Warren that leaps him up he's in

0:30:00.110,0:30:03.790
11th place can he ranked one after that

0:30:02.840,0:30:07.550
yes

0:30:03.790,0:30:09.110
yeah just showing you how difficult that

0:30:07.550,0:30:11.150
dive is he wasn't waiting around for Bob

0:30:09.110,0:30:12.650
to introduce him so where he goes

0:30:11.150,0:30:15.020
looking to get the dive out the way

0:30:12.650,0:30:17.330
going for broke he didn't use this in

0:30:15.020,0:30:19.130
the semi-finals here he is this is his

0:30:17.330,0:30:21.140
big dive doesn't quite get into the tuck

0:30:19.130,0:30:22.790
shape well enough a little bit loose and

0:30:21.140,0:30:26.270
so when he comes out he drops like a

0:30:22.790,0:30:28.130
stone yeah what a shame there what an

0:30:26.270,0:30:28.490
absolute shame into the hot tub to keep

0:30:28.130,0:30:31.010
warm

0:30:28.490,0:30:35.390
he knows he's Olympic quest for a medal

0:30:31.010,0:30:37.210
is over yeah trigger the head hands on

0:30:35.390,0:30:40.390
hips

0:30:37.210,0:30:44.200
all the body language tells you when he

0:30:40.390,0:30:49.059
knows he's just now playing for a decent

0:30:44.200,0:30:52.149
spot at the end Chris Meers lapping up

0:30:49.059,0:30:53.890
the adulation going for the reverse two

0:30:52.149,0:30:56.529
and a half somersaults one half twists

0:30:53.890,0:30:59.230
as the first of the upping the ante

0:30:56.529,0:31:07.480
dives from Chris Meers after the two

0:30:59.230,0:31:09.370
threes he's a three point three boy he

0:31:07.480,0:31:10.809
had it on the take-off just playing a

0:31:09.370,0:31:13.510
little bit safe as he went into the

0:31:10.809,0:31:15.190
water he sailed over on his sacrament

0:31:13.510,0:31:16.720
ivory now he's just a little bit short

0:31:15.190,0:31:18.460
on his third round look pretty good on

0:31:16.720,0:31:20.080
the end of the timing board one and a

0:31:18.460,0:31:22.390
half twist into the two and a half

0:31:20.080,0:31:24.820
somersaults all looks good he just stops

0:31:22.390,0:31:26.380
it a little bit short what a shame the

0:31:24.820,0:31:28.270
splash being thrown away from the diving

0:31:26.380,0:31:30.850
board a little bit too much of it seven

0:31:28.270,0:31:35.620
and a half's I think not quite as good

0:31:30.850,0:31:37.690
as earlier a little bit behind the able

0:31:35.620,0:31:40.809
there's some great expressions they were

0:31:37.690,0:31:43.929
there 7.5 across the border Chris Meers

0:31:40.809,0:31:47.950
times the degree of difficulty 3.3 gives

0:31:43.929,0:31:52.510
you 70 4.25 Alex Day parties reverse two

0:31:47.950,0:31:54.250
and a half with Pike that's more like it

0:31:52.510,0:31:56.860
now are we going to see the first

0:31:54.250,0:32:00.070
perfect ten that isn't very far away

0:31:56.860,0:32:02.289
that's nine point five it's very very

0:32:00.070,0:32:04.090
good it needed to be Alex opting for a

0:32:02.289,0:32:07.090
slight still doesn't look happy come on

0:32:04.090,0:32:09.690
Alex give us a smile nine point five I'm

0:32:07.090,0:32:13.779
predicting that's an absolutely stunning

0:32:09.690,0:32:15.340
reverse two and a half squeezing into

0:32:13.779,0:32:17.350
that Pike shape looking where he's been

0:32:15.340,0:32:19.510
rather than where he's going points his

0:32:17.350,0:32:23.919
toes towards the scoreboard and buries

0:32:19.510,0:32:26.830
the entry judges maybe being a little

0:32:23.919,0:32:28.659
mean on that nines across the board

0:32:26.830,0:32:29.799
eighty-one good mark

0:32:28.659,0:32:31.299
very good mark but could have been

0:32:29.799,0:32:33.610
should have been perhaps a little bit

0:32:31.299,0:32:35.140
better than that it was day party into

0:32:33.610,0:32:37.870
first place for the time being in the

0:32:35.140,0:32:40.409
kibosh is reversed two and a half on our

0:32:37.870,0:32:40.409
twists

0:32:40.900,0:32:45.440
well that's good from kibosh it just

0:32:43.430,0:32:48.620
rolling over on his entry into the water

0:32:45.440,0:32:51.020
just marginally the tape on the back

0:32:48.620,0:32:52.670
obviously to support that area divers

0:32:51.020,0:32:54.440
get a lot of problems they are bending

0:32:52.670,0:32:56.120
and moving themselves in such a

0:32:54.440,0:32:57.830
ballistic and dynamic way

0:32:56.120,0:33:00.470
lots of aches and pains and injuries

0:32:57.830,0:33:02.390
occur training for long long hours ok

0:33:00.470,0:33:05.450
Russia being held together by sticky

0:33:02.390,0:33:06.650
tape literally anyway he's made it

0:33:05.450,0:33:08.360
through the prelims of Sammy's and

0:33:06.650,0:33:11.450
hippies in the final and that's one of

0:33:08.360,0:33:13.490
his brother dives we have a technology

0:33:11.450,0:33:16.010
we will rebuild him and they have

0:33:13.490,0:33:19.970
seventy nine point two zero for kavaja

0:33:16.010,0:33:23.810
and up to third he goes Patrick housing

0:33:19.970,0:33:26.240
now eightth in Beijing the worlds in

0:33:23.810,0:33:28.670
Shanghai last year three point nine this

0:33:26.240,0:33:30.710
one oh it's worth shouting and screaming

0:33:28.670,0:33:32.780
about house thing coming out all guns

0:33:30.710,0:33:34.430
blazing moving himself up on the

0:33:32.780,0:33:37.010
semi-final way who's doing this dive

0:33:34.430,0:33:39.440
with two twists busting out the big one

0:33:37.010,0:33:43.370
now with the forward two and a half with

0:33:39.440,0:33:44.990
three twists one two three he must be

0:33:43.370,0:33:46.910
dizzy by the time he finishes that many

0:33:44.990,0:33:49.490
twists he does a good job to get in that

0:33:46.910,0:33:51.410
degree of difficulty is huge the

0:33:49.490,0:33:52.970
execution is probably seven seven point

0:33:51.410,0:33:55.640
five but on a three point nine that's

0:33:52.970,0:34:01.520
going to get you 85 points plus house

0:33:55.640,0:34:03.980
ding Wow incredible Wow indeed he's

0:34:01.520,0:34:06.310
wowed the crowd and the judges with that

0:34:03.980,0:34:09.470
eighty-seven point seven five and

0:34:06.310,0:34:12.170
housing with that go for broke dive

0:34:09.470,0:34:13.130
really has moved up into first place

0:34:12.170,0:34:15.740
just ahead

0:34:13.130,0:34:19.280
Alexander Day party now here's another

0:34:15.740,0:34:21.020
man who's on the forum tonight he's

0:34:19.280,0:34:24.020
first two dives number three coming up

0:34:21.020,0:34:26.420
now at roy doom a it's the easy one

0:34:24.020,0:34:28.010
compared to the earlier ones hey back

0:34:26.420,0:34:31.190
two and a half several sorts with Mike

0:34:28.010,0:34:32.810
at only 3.0 degree of difficulty you

0:34:31.190,0:34:34.760
know this is the dive the weakest I've

0:34:32.810,0:34:36.590
enjoyed amazed list he used to open with

0:34:34.760,0:34:39.050
it but he used to to leave him with too

0:34:36.590,0:34:41.210
much to do anyway he's decided to move

0:34:39.050,0:34:42.800
it to the middle of his program and it

0:34:41.210,0:34:45.200
seems to be working much better there

0:34:42.800,0:34:47.510
it's obviously still only 3.0 degree of

0:34:45.200,0:34:49.760
difficulty but if he's scoring more than

0:34:47.510,0:34:52.130
eight which he will on that then that's

0:34:49.760,0:34:53.570
a really good effort might move him down

0:34:52.130,0:34:54.510
the leaderboard not because he didn't

0:34:53.570,0:34:56.460
perform it well enough

0:34:54.510,0:34:58.740
because of its low degree of difficulty

0:34:56.460,0:35:00.600
we've seen some big dives going in and

0:34:58.740,0:35:02.880
some big dive still to come

0:35:00.600,0:35:04.710
well he's still hanging on in there he's

0:35:02.880,0:35:06.420
in the first place for the time being

0:35:04.710,0:35:08.250
with that seventy six point five zero

0:35:06.420,0:35:10.500
and it's getting a bit bunched at the

0:35:08.250,0:35:14.490
top something with dumain housing not

0:35:10.500,0:35:18.960
much between them and here is the second

0:35:14.490,0:35:23.280
ranked diver after round to Mexico for

0:35:18.960,0:35:24.270
four and a half years Oh cast Elios on

0:35:23.280,0:35:27.390
the money

0:35:24.270,0:35:29.010
this is his bogey dive forward four and

0:35:27.390,0:35:32.460
a half three point eight degree of

0:35:29.010,0:35:34.110
difficulty and this one's so easy to

0:35:32.460,0:35:35.940
make a mistake on his back from the end

0:35:34.110,0:35:38.670
a little bit a couple of inches away but

0:35:35.940,0:35:40.080
he up up and away he's so small so

0:35:38.670,0:35:42.630
compact that when he gets into that

0:35:40.080,0:35:44.520
shape he just spins and spins this is

0:35:42.630,0:35:47.820
gonna be big it's gonna go over 90

0:35:44.520,0:35:51.060
points so it should - and Castillo

0:35:47.820,0:35:54.600
Mexico on fire what a competition this

0:35:51.060,0:35:55.530
is turning into 95 for Kayla Castillo

0:35:54.600,0:35:58.830
welt up

0:35:55.530,0:36:00.750
he now has would you believe a 22 point

0:35:58.830,0:36:03.540
lead over du made a sizable at this

0:36:00.750,0:36:05.430
stage of the competition ching hai's

0:36:03.540,0:36:12.930
reversed three and a half seven sorts

0:36:05.430,0:36:16.230
the chinese not quite yet oh that's

0:36:12.930,0:36:18.600
decisive bob was laying it down they're

0:36:16.230,0:36:21.660
not quite in the groove and that he's

0:36:18.600,0:36:23.880
just slipped right into his groove my

0:36:21.660,0:36:26.310
goodness here we go

0:36:23.880,0:36:27.810
reverse three and a half somersaults

0:36:26.310,0:36:29.010
spinning backwards towards the diving

0:36:27.810,0:36:31.680
board it's very easy to get

0:36:29.010,0:36:36.390
disorientated and he's absolutely buried

0:36:31.680,0:36:38.280
the entry hardly any splash 99.5 s just

0:36:36.390,0:36:45.150
showing you the strain on the divers

0:36:38.280,0:36:47.070
body Wow beautiful dive are we getting

0:36:45.150,0:36:50.400
some marks in this round a walk Ethan

0:36:47.070,0:36:53.160
Warren's 91 95 from Castillo Huerta and

0:36:50.400,0:36:56.550
now ninety six point two five from Ching

0:36:53.160,0:36:58.350
Kai and he goes into second place but

0:36:56.550,0:37:01.380
not a million miles behind Castillo

0:36:58.350,0:37:02.940
quarter here zakharov what do you have

0:37:01.380,0:37:04.760
analyst reversed three and a half some

0:37:02.940,0:37:08.720
sort with tuck

0:37:04.760,0:37:11.810
oh it's almost as good as ching hai's

0:37:08.720,0:37:14.000
almost as good he's up higher than ching

0:37:11.810,0:37:14.570
hai's in fact I actually like to dive

0:37:14.000,0:37:18.590
more

0:37:14.570,0:37:22.040
however he just moves on the entry just

0:37:18.590,0:37:24.110
tips over vertical ever so slightly he's

0:37:22.040,0:37:25.940
gonna get eight and a half he might get

0:37:24.110,0:37:27.020
eight eight eight and a half it's not

0:37:25.940,0:37:29.630
quite worth nines

0:37:27.020,0:37:33.500
oh it's ninety points though well there

0:37:29.630,0:37:34.280
are there abouts he's responding staying

0:37:33.500,0:37:36.200
in contention

0:37:34.280,0:37:38.330
yeah the marks it will count our eight

0:37:36.200,0:37:40.400
point five times that degree of

0:37:38.330,0:37:43.930
difficulty you get eighty nine point two

0:37:40.400,0:37:47.630
five boy is this competition hotting up

0:37:43.930,0:37:49.670
hardly anything separating the top three

0:37:47.630,0:37:53.630
and will be on top four after we've seen

0:37:49.670,0:37:56.090
her Cheong surely reverse three and a

0:37:53.630,0:37:57.950
half several sorts with tuck three point

0:37:56.090,0:38:07.550
five just taking his time as he

0:37:57.950,0:38:08.870
contemplates a very big dive oh it's

0:38:07.550,0:38:10.370
gonna be there well there abouts on

0:38:08.870,0:38:12.890
eight and a half isn't that interesting

0:38:10.370,0:38:15.560
chink I Ilya Zakharov and he Chong all

0:38:12.890,0:38:18.020
of which like for like the reverse three

0:38:15.560,0:38:20.680
and a half Ching Kyle ain't Anna's

0:38:18.020,0:38:23.390
marker and I think he won that round

0:38:20.680,0:38:25.370
he Chong doing a great job they're just

0:38:23.390,0:38:26.750
tipping over a vertical like sacrify

0:38:25.370,0:38:29.630
think you'll pretty much get the same

0:38:26.750,0:38:31.400
marks as zakharov what does that do to

0:38:29.630,0:38:33.740
the scoreboard who is in the lead

0:38:31.400,0:38:36.350
halfway through this exciting contest

0:38:33.740,0:38:38.960
well it is not what we anticipated and

0:38:36.350,0:38:40.970
saying her Chong not what he anticipated

0:38:38.960,0:38:43.640
cuz he ought surely me think he's infra

0:38:40.970,0:38:46.700
metal probably in the big G big G

0:38:43.640,0:38:50.840
alluding him now look at this after

0:38:46.700,0:38:53.840
round three yella Castilla welter Ilya

0:38:50.840,0:38:57.590
Zakharov chin Kai Troy do Mei is about

0:38:53.840,0:39:00.320
19 points adrift her Chong has a lot of

0:38:57.590,0:39:02.420
ground to make up there after counting

0:39:00.320,0:39:05.570
in six behind of course the top three

0:39:02.420,0:39:07.490
don't falter they party on page two and

0:39:05.570,0:39:10.730
Chris Meers bringing up the rear but

0:39:07.490,0:39:13.280
closing in on Kenny Oh in 11th place

0:39:10.730,0:39:16.210
this is a competition and we haven't

0:39:13.280,0:39:16.210
seen the best of it yet

0:39:21.930,0:39:27.640
the defending Olympic champion removing

0:39:25.539,0:39:29.650
himself on the hot tub going back to his

0:39:27.640,0:39:31.210
spot wherever he's sitting to compose

0:39:29.650,0:39:34.509
himself halfway through the competition

0:39:31.210,0:39:38.230
he's got some work to do and at the

0:39:34.509,0:39:41.619
moment is not in a medal place maybe not

0:39:38.230,0:39:45.130
in a very good place either round four

0:39:41.619,0:39:46.480
can yo are Malaysia starting things off

0:39:45.130,0:39:51.309
for the reverse two and a half

0:39:46.480,0:39:53.740
somersaults 1/2 twists Pike oh he's back

0:39:51.309,0:39:56.410
into it with a sparkly one that's a good

0:39:53.740,0:40:00.160
dive fair from Kelly Oh poured that poor

0:39:56.410,0:40:03.579
third round dive for find dive he's got

0:40:00.160,0:40:05.619
himself back up for it that's a great

0:40:03.579,0:40:08.079
dive three point three to create

0:40:05.619,0:40:11.200
difficulty this okay eights and eight

0:40:08.079,0:40:13.390
point five s it's a very good dive but

0:40:11.200,0:40:15.549
you can't afford to make any mistakes no

0:40:13.390,0:40:18.220
damage done in round three forty nine

0:40:15.549,0:40:19.900
point five zero which is not anywhere

0:40:18.220,0:40:24.400
near what do you require but seventy

0:40:19.900,0:40:28.029
nine point two zero is good reaction and

0:40:24.400,0:40:31.960
a good comeback by Kenny Oh Ethan

0:40:28.029,0:40:33.400
warrant eight after round three in with

0:40:31.960,0:40:37.829
three and a half seven spots were tucked

0:40:33.400,0:40:41.200
three point four for the Australian

0:40:37.829,0:40:43.630
Mike's give us his immediate impressions

0:40:41.200,0:40:48.269
all his diver Susi leaves the diving pit

0:40:43.630,0:40:48.269
let's see what he could do in round four

0:40:50.349,0:40:55.449
you're he's backed it up his third round

0:40:53.619,0:40:57.369
I've four forward four and half sailed

0:40:55.449,0:40:59.619
over 90 points this is slightly lower

0:40:57.369,0:41:02.880
degree of difficulty but I'd say this is

0:40:59.619,0:41:06.160
going to get mid-80s beautiful dive

0:41:02.880,0:41:08.199
waits patiently goes into the water with

0:41:06.160,0:41:09.729
hardly a ripple of splash you know what

0:41:08.199,0:41:11.199
you're looking for now and the judges

0:41:09.729,0:41:12.789
certainly know what they're looking for

0:41:11.199,0:41:15.670
and it's something along those lines

0:41:12.789,0:41:18.400
good work I'm over a smile and thumbs up

0:41:15.670,0:41:21.039
thank you eighty six point seven zero

0:41:18.400,0:41:23.559
before Ethan Warren didn't let me down

0:41:21.039,0:41:25.089
and doesn't let himself down or

0:41:23.559,0:41:27.069
Australia down for that matter and

0:41:25.089,0:41:29.289
they're creeps into first place

0:41:27.069,0:41:33.519
Xavier Garcia with the reverse three and

0:41:29.289,0:41:36.729
a half with tuck no he's going for Polk

0:41:33.519,0:41:38.140
and I think his campaign is broken now

0:41:36.729,0:41:42.069
unfortunately Ford four and a half

0:41:38.140,0:41:43.809
previously shorter vertical yet raised

0:41:42.069,0:41:46.180
eyebrows from the coaches and this one

0:41:43.809,0:41:48.339
the surf is definitely up here we go

0:41:46.180,0:41:49.660
reverse three and a half just hangs on

0:41:48.339,0:41:52.269
into his touch shape a little bit too

0:41:49.660,0:41:59.170
long and over he goes and here comes the

0:41:52.269,0:42:03.479
wave get your surfboard type 42 not my

0:41:59.170,0:42:03.479
age sadly three fours

0:42:04.740,0:42:07.730
where's Mia's

0:42:07.859,0:42:12.280
came through the preliminaries in the

0:42:10.480,0:42:14.560
final position moved up a couple of

0:42:12.280,0:42:17.890
places run a few places actually to make

0:42:14.560,0:42:20.470
that final and now finds himself in the

0:42:17.890,0:42:23.410
final in round four with a Ford two and

0:42:20.470,0:42:25.089
a half seven sorts two twists so again

0:42:23.410,0:42:27.150
just to not jump on the degree of

0:42:25.089,0:42:34.780
difficulty this is a three point four

0:42:27.150,0:42:37.119
performed in the pike position oh it's

0:42:34.780,0:42:39.280
good funk Chris I'm actually taken aback

0:42:37.119,0:42:43.570
by the noise that this pride generates

0:42:39.280,0:42:47.320
it is quite extraordinary yeah

0:42:43.570,0:42:49.440
he's holding his composure making a

0:42:47.320,0:42:51.970
slight arrow on his previous round I've

0:42:49.440,0:42:54.520
that's good it's a little bit short as

0:42:51.970,0:42:56.950
he goes in he does disguise it very well

0:42:54.520,0:42:59.410
maybe you're sneaking a tour to fajn the

0:42:56.950,0:43:02.560
judges it's straight up and down it is

0:42:59.410,0:43:06.910
3.4 degree of difficulty could get close

0:43:02.560,0:43:11.440
to 80 points these are the max the count

0:43:06.910,0:43:14.470
eight 7.5 7.5 78 points to zero for

0:43:11.440,0:43:23.160
Chris Meers quite as aware of the camera

0:43:14.470,0:43:26.530
as Ethan is Alexander Day party for

0:43:23.160,0:43:28.330
seventh after three in with three and a

0:43:26.530,0:43:32.349
half somersaults with tuck three point

0:43:28.330,0:43:33.910
four a degree of difficulty it's a good

0:43:32.349,0:43:35.680
dive you can hear the cheers from the

0:43:33.910,0:43:37.750
coaches who were just behind the judges

0:43:35.680,0:43:39.310
he is a little bit over a vertical but

0:43:37.750,0:43:42.010
it's worth saying six weeks ago

0:43:39.310,0:43:45.010
Alexander de Partie hit the diving board

0:43:42.010,0:43:47.589
with his head on this dive he has 22

0:43:45.010,0:43:50.260
stitches or had 22 stitches on his

0:43:47.589,0:43:52.480
forehead and is just showing the courage

0:43:50.260,0:43:55.270
and the strength of character in this

0:43:52.480,0:43:57.790
young man silver medals - in this event

0:43:55.270,0:44:00.040
in Athens and Beijing and he's here

0:43:57.790,0:44:02.320
today to hang on to that Olympic dream I

0:44:00.040,0:44:06.700
read somewhere the cut was ten point

0:44:02.320,0:44:13.599
five centimeters long eighty three point

0:44:06.700,0:44:17.380
three zero for de Partie who departs now

0:44:13.599,0:44:20.230
to Ilya kvasir the three point five

0:44:17.380,0:44:21.970
reverse three and a half somersaults

0:44:20.230,0:44:23.859
you can only finds himself in night then

0:44:21.970,0:44:28.990
probably not challenging for a medal on

0:44:23.859,0:44:32.079
this occasion boys aerial work is very

0:44:28.990,0:44:34.270
very good just fractionally over as he

0:44:32.079,0:44:36.250
went into the water it's a big dive and

0:44:34.270,0:44:38.440
well everyone's doing big dives this is

0:44:36.250,0:44:42.700
so impressive what it is the Olympic

0:44:38.440,0:44:46.150
final after all wow just consistently

0:44:42.700,0:44:48.099
very good to get himself through look at

0:44:46.150,0:44:51.430
the strain and power watching the knees

0:44:48.099,0:44:53.710
come in spinning around so quickly pops

0:44:51.430,0:44:55.180
his feet up reaches back just tipping

0:44:53.710,0:44:57.960
over beat there's a good job saving it

0:44:55.180,0:45:01.480
and you get over 80 points for that

0:44:57.960,0:45:03.550
eighty two point two five remember all

0:45:01.480,0:45:05.260
those marks with a line through do not

0:45:03.550,0:45:08.339
count towards the total the ones without

0:45:05.260,0:45:12.640
do times the degree of difficulty

0:45:08.339,0:45:14.829
Patrick housing in with three and a half

0:45:12.640,0:45:17.200
several sorts with tuck takes place

0:45:14.829,0:45:19.390
after round three but it's very tight

0:45:17.200,0:45:24.310
for the bronze medal position at the

0:45:19.390,0:45:26.290
moment boys yes didn't quite get out of

0:45:24.310,0:45:28.660
the dive quickly enough as he went into

0:45:26.290,0:45:29.740
water he's very tall as a diver so he

0:45:28.660,0:45:31.750
doesn't have to work a little bit harder

0:45:29.740,0:45:34.180
to fit in all these rotations and

0:45:31.750,0:45:36.250
technically he is absolutely spot-on

0:45:34.180,0:45:37.660
just a little bit low on the water here

0:45:36.250,0:45:39.400
you see him just straightening out as

0:45:37.660,0:45:42.849
he's entering so I think he's only

0:45:39.400,0:45:48.550
giving you at 7s 7.5 s and that will put

0:45:42.849,0:45:51.040
him slightly off the pace yep we've the

0:45:48.550,0:45:53.319
confirmation on scoreboard lowest score

0:45:51.040,0:45:55.450
joint lowest score he's had so five four

0:45:53.319,0:45:57.790
rounds and they're talking it over with

0:45:55.450,0:45:59.200
a coach smile to follow because he knows

0:45:57.790,0:46:01.780
precisely what he has done

0:45:59.200,0:46:04.020
not a bad dive not quite what he hoped

0:46:01.780,0:46:08.560
for 70 6.50

0:46:04.020,0:46:12.430
troy Dumais can he be adding to the US

0:46:08.560,0:46:15.220
medal tally in the Aquatic Centre this

0:46:12.430,0:46:17.920
week both swimming of course very

0:46:15.220,0:46:20.230
proficient and prolific and diving doing

0:46:17.920,0:46:23.349
pretty well two inward three and a half

0:46:20.230,0:46:25.990
somersaults with tuck for do maze fourth

0:46:23.349,0:46:28.630
round dive degree of difficulty three

0:46:25.990,0:46:30.970
point four on this

0:46:28.630,0:46:33.460
oh it's a decisive dive for domain he

0:46:30.970,0:46:36.250
just fluffed it ever so slightly as he

0:46:33.460,0:46:37.930
went in just ever so slightly is always

0:46:36.250,0:46:39.730
low on the water he's not as strong as

0:46:37.930,0:46:41.410
the other athletes here we go

0:46:39.730,0:46:43.900
technically is over the diving board a

0:46:41.410,0:46:45.820
safe distance away you could just see

0:46:43.900,0:46:47.560
here a little bit short as he goes in

0:46:45.820,0:46:49.360
loses his feet throwing up a little bit

0:46:47.560,0:46:49.990
of splash now will the judges penalize

0:46:49.360,0:46:52.300
him heavily

0:46:49.990,0:46:57.090
or will he sneak over 80 points if he

0:46:52.300,0:46:59.680
does thank good on him his family

0:46:57.090,0:47:01.450
cheering whooping and hollering as

0:46:59.680,0:47:03.310
always there's six and a half for one

0:47:01.450,0:47:06.360
judge eight from the others interesting

0:47:03.310,0:47:11.200
very interesting as somebody once said

0:47:06.360,0:47:14.080
81.6 zero troy do mate oldest competitor

0:47:11.200,0:47:17.830
in the competition at 32 years of age

0:47:14.080,0:47:25.690
now this could be a pivotal dive a young

0:47:17.830,0:47:28.690
El Castillo quarter oh the Mexicans are

0:47:25.690,0:47:31.240
on fire this well I'm not surprised

0:47:28.690,0:47:33.340
they're punch in the air so am I yo

0:47:31.240,0:47:35.560
castelia I thought he'd used up all his

0:47:33.340,0:47:37.330
good dives in the prelims and Semien I'm

0:47:35.560,0:47:40.150
pleased to say he's proving me wrong

0:47:37.330,0:47:43.990
he's worked so hard his consistency is

0:47:40.150,0:47:45.940
squashed so so good this is a decisive

0:47:43.990,0:47:47.950
dive it's the one that he could have

0:47:45.940,0:47:50.440
wobbled on and he's absolutely drilled

0:47:47.950,0:47:53.320
it is hit 90 points it's gonna be close

0:47:50.440,0:47:56.290
- it's almost there eighty six point

0:47:53.320,0:47:58.840
seven first round 85 second round 95

0:47:56.290,0:48:01.870
third round and fourth round dive eighty

0:47:58.840,0:48:06.540
nine point two five gives him a 30 point

0:48:01.870,0:48:09.910
lead over Troy Dumais at this stage Wow

0:48:06.540,0:48:11.680
chin Kai in with three and a half summer

0:48:09.910,0:48:13.900
sorts with tuck has a lot of pressure on

0:48:11.680,0:48:16.780
the Chinese here this is not going quite

0:48:13.900,0:48:19.650
as we'd anticipated this is three point

0:48:16.780,0:48:19.650
four there

0:48:19.660,0:48:24.190
ah Ching Kai eating up the pressure I

0:48:22.539,0:48:25.470
don't even know whether he knows it's in

0:48:24.190,0:48:30.039
the arena

0:48:25.470,0:48:32.200
unfazed an unfaltering inward right over

0:48:30.039,0:48:34.960
the diving board squeezing into the Tuck

0:48:32.200,0:48:37.690
shape cruising piking out of it showing

0:48:34.960,0:48:39.940
the judges how easy it is for him this

0:48:37.690,0:48:43.329
is going to be 90 points as well look at

0:48:39.940,0:48:48.309
the strength in those legs absolutely

0:48:43.329,0:48:53.619
precise Wow I think that's what we call

0:48:48.309,0:48:57.970
game on now yeah 91 point eight zero one

0:48:53.619,0:48:58.420
and two separated by point two zero of a

0:48:57.970,0:49:04.240
mark

0:48:58.420,0:49:06.010
I like zakharov like it more to the

0:49:04.240,0:49:07.720
point for two and a half seven shots to

0:49:06.010,0:49:12.220
twist is he gonna put himself back in

0:49:07.720,0:49:15.400
pole position after this oh yes I think

0:49:12.220,0:49:16.869
you will three point for the same degree

0:49:15.400,0:49:20.230
of difficulty that we've just seen from

0:49:16.869,0:49:22.990
Ching Kai and this is the easiest of his

0:49:20.230,0:49:26.049
last three dives and this is by no means

0:49:22.990,0:49:28.480
easy look how he just cruise his double

0:49:26.049,0:49:30.099
twist so much time if anything he's just

0:49:28.480,0:49:32.950
a little bit too far away from the

0:49:30.099,0:49:36.339
diving board four nines should get eight

0:49:32.950,0:49:37.630
point five let's see the judges might

0:49:36.339,0:49:40.440
penalize because he is in the middle of

0:49:37.630,0:49:43.420
the pool should have swam to the far end

0:49:40.440,0:49:46.569
got a time for us eighty six point seven

0:49:43.420,0:49:49.930
zero in third but I know it's not a cast

0:49:46.569,0:49:55.329
adrift third by any means at three point

0:49:49.930,0:49:58.869
three points behind silver exactly four

0:49:55.329,0:50:02.200
points behind the leader who is still a

0:49:58.869,0:50:05.589
Castillo went up on the way her Chong

0:50:02.200,0:50:08.380
fifth the world champion Olympic

0:50:05.589,0:50:10.750
champion and a little bit of pressure

0:50:08.380,0:50:13.390
here three point four in with three and

0:50:10.750,0:50:16.510
a half somersault with tuck

0:50:13.390,0:50:19.140
boy he hasn't responded he is a little

0:50:16.510,0:50:22.420
bit off his game it just goes to show

0:50:19.140,0:50:25.270
what the occasion could do to people he

0:50:22.420,0:50:28.330
is feeling the occasion the defending

0:50:25.270,0:50:31.000
champion is slightly off his game and

0:50:28.330,0:50:33.370
you cannot be slightly off your game he

0:50:31.000,0:50:35.380
is by no means out of it so he Chong is

0:50:33.370,0:50:37.630
still very much in the hunt for medals

0:50:35.380,0:50:39.490
but he's certainly not way out in front

0:50:37.630,0:50:41.140
where he's accustomed to being just

0:50:39.490,0:50:43.540
tipping over a vertical it's gonna get

0:50:41.140,0:50:46.810
eights and 8.5 but he would he needed

0:50:43.540,0:50:50.380
nine to 9.5 to keep up with the pack

0:50:46.810,0:50:52.600
well I'm very intrigued is he got 85 he

0:50:50.380,0:50:55.480
has to make up 28 points to get gold

0:50:52.600,0:50:57.850
right now 28 points is he gonna do that

0:50:55.480,0:50:59.530
no unlikely unless people make mistakes

0:50:57.850,0:51:02.020
he could end up at the medals and that

0:50:59.530,0:51:04.570
would be a shock here's how it looks

0:51:02.020,0:51:06.490
after round four this is thrilling it's

0:51:04.570,0:51:08.680
very entertaining and we're on the edges

0:51:06.490,0:51:12.370
of our seats hope you are too look at

0:51:08.680,0:51:13.990
that hardly four points exactly four

0:51:12.370,0:51:17.460
points that you bother you using your

0:51:13.990,0:51:17.460
fingers and toes between one and three

0:51:18.990,0:51:25.540
champion struggling for medals Chris

0:51:22.270,0:51:27.630
Meers off the bottom into 11th place

0:51:25.540,0:51:31.210
ground just seen that on the scoreboard

0:51:27.630,0:51:32.860
and he finished above 12th well I was

0:51:31.210,0:51:34.180
happy to be in the final of course but

0:51:32.860,0:51:36.540
any progress you can make up that

0:51:34.180,0:51:38.230
leaderboard he'll be delighted with

0:51:36.540,0:51:41.320
that's what it is

0:51:38.230,0:51:44.830
that's where we are London 2012 which

0:51:41.320,0:51:46.180
has been a roaring success every

0:51:44.830,0:51:49.200
departments and it has been for the

0:51:46.180,0:51:52.210
Chinese who won an free gold medal in

0:51:49.200,0:51:58.180
diving so far but at the moment they're

0:51:52.210,0:52:01.330
not start of the penultimate round of

0:51:58.180,0:52:04.090
the men's 3-meter springboard final it

0:52:01.330,0:52:06.400
is wide open for the medals and it's not

0:52:04.090,0:52:10.570
being dominated by the Chinese at this

0:52:06.400,0:52:12.250
stage Ken yo with his Panama dive in

0:52:10.570,0:52:15.280
with three and a half summer sorts with

0:52:12.250,0:52:18.060
tuckworth three point four on the degree

0:52:15.280,0:52:18.060
of difficulty

0:52:19.090,0:52:23.380
yeah it's one of Ken's trickier dives

0:52:21.670,0:52:25.210
his biggest degree of difficulty at

0:52:23.380,0:52:26.380
three point four and he's done a very

0:52:25.210,0:52:28.690
good job with it

0:52:26.380,0:52:30.550
come in turn off that extraordinary high

0:52:28.690,0:52:32.770
at the end of the last one there we're

0:52:30.550,0:52:34.720
seeing the big guns going at each other

0:52:32.770,0:52:36.460
Ken bringing us down to some kind of

0:52:34.720,0:52:38.800
reality but that is a very well executed

0:52:36.460,0:52:40.300
dive lots of people asking about the

0:52:38.800,0:52:42.700
cloth that divers seem to use it's

0:52:40.300,0:52:44.410
actually called a chamois Sammy Lee who

0:52:42.700,0:52:47.050
invented the Sam he's actually here he

0:52:44.410,0:52:48.670
competed in the 1948 Olympic Games stick

0:52:47.050,0:52:50.770
tie off the divers in between drives

0:52:48.670,0:52:53.440
keep them warm so their muscles don't

0:52:50.770,0:52:55.000
get too cold but also to dry their hands

0:52:53.440,0:52:56.920
and shin so they can hold on to those

0:52:55.000,0:52:59.020
shapes hope that makes sense at home

0:52:56.920,0:53:01.990
that's where Sammy the show-me came from

0:52:59.020,0:53:06.460
exactly okay seventy six point five zero

0:53:01.990,0:53:08.950
for cameo with his fifth round dive the

0:53:06.460,0:53:11.350
second up is Ethan Warren on Australia

0:53:08.950,0:53:13.960
who's not out of it yet you know he's

0:53:11.350,0:53:16.320
sixth place with very good dives

0:53:13.960,0:53:19.510
here comes the reverse three and a half

0:53:16.320,0:53:22.270
why leaks it in as well with hardly a

0:53:19.510,0:53:24.190
ripple of splash very good he's

0:53:22.270,0:53:25.720
certainly upped his game he's a bit here

0:53:24.190,0:53:27.880
and there in the prelims and made it

0:53:25.720,0:53:30.010
through all lands used to stop himself

0:53:27.880,0:53:31.540
falling back in the pool Wow he

0:53:30.010,0:53:33.700
certainly didn't fall in the pool on

0:53:31.540,0:53:35.620
this one just 20 years old from

0:53:33.700,0:53:37.030
Australia first saw him a couple of

0:53:35.620,0:53:39.220
years ago and the Commonwealth Games in

0:53:37.030,0:53:41.440
Delhi and I was ultra impressed now and

0:53:39.220,0:53:49.030
he isn't failing to deliver here in this

0:53:41.440,0:53:51.580
final Wow exceptional diving eighty nine

0:53:49.030,0:53:53.350
point two five now he's going for a bit

0:53:51.580,0:53:57.550
of a run as well conserve your energy

0:53:53.350,0:53:59.680
boy these guys are ultra fit don't look

0:53:57.550,0:54:02.230
at me when you say that please Ethan

0:53:59.680,0:54:07.300
warrant them the top of the pile for the

0:54:02.230,0:54:10.030
time being here's Xavier

0:54:07.300,0:54:12.520
Alana Garcia whose race is run I'm

0:54:10.030,0:54:13.960
afraid 12th place for him I'd like to

0:54:12.520,0:54:14.950
move up a spot or two if he can with

0:54:13.960,0:54:18.730
this in with three and a half

0:54:14.950,0:54:20.200
somersaults with tuck oh the wheels have

0:54:18.730,0:54:21.880
come off and they're bouncing down the

0:54:20.200,0:54:24.760
street now not to be caught

0:54:21.880,0:54:27.279
unfortunately a real shame that's three

0:54:24.760,0:54:29.890
poor ties from javi

0:54:27.279,0:54:30.729
yeah this is what happens sometimes you

0:54:29.890,0:54:33.640
lose it

0:54:30.729,0:54:35.529
diving is very much like that sometimes

0:54:33.640,0:54:38.529
when your head starting it over rotating

0:54:35.529,0:54:40.359
low to splash coming up yeah into the

0:54:38.529,0:54:42.159
hot tub and yeah I don't know where I am

0:54:40.359,0:54:43.239
we're doing what's going on and feeling

0:54:42.159,0:54:47.409
over the shop

0:54:43.239,0:54:50.049
tough day yeah and the marks won't make

0:54:47.409,0:54:54.119
you feel any better either appeared on

0:54:50.049,0:54:54.119
your screen bring up three point five

0:54:55.319,0:55:03.239
what he was hoping for with that the

0:55:00.039,0:55:08.289
total mark thirty five point seven zero

0:55:03.239,0:55:14.199
now Chris me is his fifth round I've got

0:55:08.289,0:55:16.359
two big ones to finish in with three and

0:55:14.199,0:55:20.079
a half somersaults tuck three point four

0:55:16.359,0:55:22.839
degree of difficulty he's just done the

0:55:20.079,0:55:25.630
same as hobby just before him overcooked

0:55:22.839,0:55:26.559
it just staying in his tuck shape a

0:55:25.630,0:55:28.419
little bit you could see on the

0:55:26.559,0:55:30.039
expression he knows instant feedback

0:55:28.419,0:55:32.169
when the water smacks you in the lower

0:55:30.039,0:55:34.630
back in the back of the legs all the

0:55:32.169,0:55:35.890
aerial work is very very good just

0:55:34.630,0:55:36.969
hanging on a little bit you can see him

0:55:35.890,0:55:39.729
tipping over there

0:55:36.969,0:55:41.679
it's another surfboard moment what a

0:55:39.729,0:55:44.140
shame for me is look at that right over

0:55:41.679,0:55:45.009
the diving board aerial work is

0:55:44.140,0:55:47.559
excellent

0:55:45.009,0:55:52.119
just waiting too long before let's go

0:55:47.559,0:55:54.640
and over he goes timber fifty six point

0:55:52.119,0:55:56.769
one zero is the mark which now will be

0:55:54.640,0:55:58.509
confirmed for you on screen five point

0:55:56.769,0:56:00.279
five coaster boards a slightly better

0:55:58.509,0:56:05.019
than it looks like he won't finish in

0:56:00.279,0:56:06.729
12th place alexander de Partie for four

0:56:05.019,0:56:10.119
and a half this is his big dive doesn't

0:56:06.729,0:56:12.699
normally do this one he's giving it a

0:56:10.119,0:56:14.229
good go and just unfortunately let it

0:56:12.699,0:56:16.689
roll over there's his mum and dad

0:56:14.229,0:56:18.609
they're here to support him he's going

0:56:16.689,0:56:21.219
for broke just seems shaking his head he

0:56:18.609,0:56:22.839
knows he's just let the dive go not seen

0:56:21.219,0:56:24.309
him do this on the springboard certainly

0:56:22.839,0:56:26.199
hasn't competed it here at these Olympic

0:56:24.309,0:56:28.749
Games just rolling over as he goes in

0:56:26.199,0:56:30.579
he's only gonna get six national 7s out

0:56:28.749,0:56:33.249
his day parties campaign for a medal

0:56:30.579,0:56:36.009
over unfortunately what a shame / and

0:56:33.249,0:56:39.190
absolutely incredible athlete well he

0:56:36.009,0:56:41.050
gave me the go I see athletes do that

0:56:39.190,0:56:42.940
holding back is an olympic file you've

0:56:41.050,0:56:45.550
got to go for broke because the

0:56:42.940,0:56:48.730
competition is so severe and so fierce

0:56:45.550,0:56:51.270
as is being proved today because in the

0:56:48.730,0:56:54.970
echo masha is not in the mix at all

0:56:51.270,0:56:57.910
anymore back two and a half sour shots

0:56:54.970,0:57:00.220
with pike for the man from ukraine he's

0:56:57.910,0:57:01.329
been lost but round dive ninth after

0:57:00.220,0:57:06.790
round four

0:57:01.329,0:57:09.490
oh it's tidy it is a low degree of

0:57:06.790,0:57:11.440
difficulty and game of tactics elect

0:57:09.490,0:57:12.760
introduces lowest degree of difficulty

0:57:11.440,0:57:14.890
now when everyone are bringing in their

0:57:12.760,0:57:18.819
their big dives out at the higher degree

0:57:14.890,0:57:22.569
of difficulties so it's probably seven

0:57:18.819,0:57:27.579
seven and a half maybe an eighth so

0:57:22.569,0:57:29.619
kibosh the middle of the pack I think in

0:57:27.579,0:57:31.750
a lovely slow-motion camera work isn't

0:57:29.619,0:57:35.650
it just bringing the dives to the viewer

0:57:31.750,0:57:39.569
sixty seven point five zero selection of

0:57:35.650,0:57:43.000
seven point five marks for a Leo Kovak

0:57:39.569,0:57:46.510
Patrick hosting three point five degree

0:57:43.000,0:57:48.220
of difficulty 8004 stepped down a bit

0:57:46.510,0:57:52.390
reversed three and a half for the

0:57:48.220,0:57:56.200
remaining German he comes out all guns

0:57:52.390,0:57:57.609
blazing on that one yeah I think it was

0:57:56.200,0:58:01.060
there's a bit more applause than that

0:57:57.609,0:58:02.710
that was superb just faltering slightly

0:58:01.060,0:58:04.810
on his previous round the inwards this

0:58:02.710,0:58:06.329
reverse absolutely spot-on

0:58:04.810,0:58:08.680
diving both springboard and platform

0:58:06.329,0:58:10.210
long long training hours for this young

0:58:08.680,0:58:11.950
man but he seems to be able to take it

0:58:10.210,0:58:14.170
all in his stride quite tall for a diver

0:58:11.950,0:58:17.470
that's his biggest the biggest dive

0:58:14.170,0:58:21.250
high-scoring dive so far well over 90

0:58:17.470,0:58:23.500
points I guess you guessed correctly he

0:58:21.250,0:58:25.040
comes confirmation that you're spot-on

0:58:23.500,0:58:26.210
ninety four point five zero

0:58:25.040,0:58:28.880
[Music]

0:58:26.210,0:58:37.370
Oh times they've aggrieved if cookie

0:58:28.880,0:58:39.050
gives us 94.5 zero now Troy doom a 3.5

0:58:37.370,0:58:41.750
yeah it's a reverse three and a half

0:58:39.050,0:58:44.240
foot once again top position for the

0:58:41.750,0:58:51.530
American and a tough position for him

0:58:44.240,0:58:54.170
fifth place boy didn't quite rip the

0:58:51.530,0:58:55.610
entry such a shame I thought that that

0:58:54.170,0:58:57.620
was going to be just what they could

0:58:55.610,0:59:01.520
prove critical this Troy slightly off

0:58:57.620,0:59:03.290
the pace he stayed with it stay with the

0:59:01.520,0:59:05.180
diving board didn't skip off he's done

0:59:03.290,0:59:07.400
all the hard work and she rolls over

0:59:05.180,0:59:10.010
doesn't quite keep the splash time it's

0:59:07.400,0:59:11.870
gonna get eight but he would have needed

0:59:10.010,0:59:13.490
well over 90 points to stay in

0:59:11.870,0:59:15.560
contention I think that will leave him

0:59:13.490,0:59:17.240
just a little bit off the pace yeah a

0:59:15.560,0:59:20.750
couple of points behind

0:59:17.240,0:59:24.880
Patrick housing could be the toy Jame

0:59:20.750,0:59:29.570
slips and drops one more position now

0:59:24.880,0:59:32.090
here is our current leader all the

0:59:29.570,0:59:35.150
pressure on the are Castillo who enter

0:59:32.090,0:59:37.340
can he keep this fantastic run going

0:59:35.150,0:59:39.710
it's an easy dive those gonna lose some

0:59:37.340,0:59:42.710
points here he will back two and a half

0:59:39.710,0:59:45.590
somersault 3.0 this has to be absolutely

0:59:42.710,0:59:49.760
spot-on yes the others will be catching

0:59:45.590,0:59:51.410
him after this well it's good but you

0:59:49.760,0:59:53.570
know this is the game of tactics yells

0:59:51.410,0:59:55.490
come out flexing his muscles doing all

0:59:53.570,0:59:57.830
his big dives early and absolutely

0:59:55.490,0:59:59.780
nailing them now this is his lowest

0:59:57.830,1:00:02.810
degree of difficulty and it's probably

0:59:59.780,1:00:05.510
its weakest his weakest dive so far just

1:00:02.810,1:00:09.290
arching into his back there it's only

1:00:05.510,1:00:13.550
gonna get eight he's gonna get what 72

1:00:09.290,1:00:15.710
73 75 at best with that back arch as he

1:00:13.550,1:00:18.050
goes in now the other boys are gonna go

1:00:15.710,1:00:19.400
and stick a 90 points plus on the board

1:00:18.050,1:00:21.560
and that's going to shake it up at the

1:00:19.400,1:00:23.720
standings well that's good enough to

1:00:21.560,1:00:26.300
keep it in the first place for now but

1:00:23.720,1:00:28.040
for the question is how much longer can

1:00:26.300,1:00:29.900
he you remain in pole position because

1:00:28.040,1:00:31.940
there's some big big dives coming up

1:00:29.900,1:00:34.970
including this one three point eight

1:00:31.940,1:00:37.400
were disastrously wrong for Ching Kai in

1:00:34.970,1:00:39.140
the prelims got it right in the semi as

1:00:37.400,1:00:39.770
though Ford four and a half somersaults

1:00:39.140,1:00:41.090
three

1:00:39.770,1:00:45.770
a word tuck this could be a hundred

1:00:41.090,1:00:47.570
points or more if he gets it right he's

1:00:45.770,1:00:51.080
just out a little bit early that is a

1:00:47.570,1:00:53.960
very very good dive it's an outstanding

1:00:51.080,1:00:55.610
takeoff he's up in the air completing

1:00:53.960,1:00:57.380
the dive almost effortless effortless

1:00:55.610,1:01:00.260
sleek sorry try and get my words out in

1:00:57.380,1:01:02.000
the excitement oh that's a shame I

1:01:00.260,1:01:03.680
thought it was gonna be the one he's out

1:01:02.000,1:01:05.540
a little early little short vertical as

1:01:03.680,1:01:07.550
he goes in it's gonna kill him well over

1:01:05.540,1:01:11.720
90 points as I mentioned that could

1:01:07.550,1:01:13.310
shake up the leaderboard or if you'd

1:01:11.720,1:01:14.780
waited in his shape just a fraction

1:01:13.310,1:01:17.570
longer we'd have seen him go over a

1:01:14.780,1:01:20.630
hundred points as it is it's ninety six

1:01:17.570,1:01:22.400
point nine zero point five work out the

1:01:20.630,1:01:27.020
scores with the lines through them as

1:01:22.400,1:01:29.540
ever do not and that puts him 25 points

1:01:27.020,1:01:39.590
clear of castillo welter but india

1:01:29.540,1:01:42.530
zakharov at some points oh that is

1:01:39.590,1:01:44.270
phenomenal you should stand up in the

1:01:42.530,1:01:47.570
crowd because we are witnessing

1:01:44.270,1:01:49.460
something truly extraordinary very hard

1:01:47.570,1:01:51.110
to please the russian coaches as you can

1:01:49.460,1:01:53.540
see but it's not very difficult to

1:01:51.110,1:01:56.090
please me that's going to go nearly 100

1:01:53.540,1:01:58.760
points it's three point nine a forward

1:01:56.090,1:02:01.730
two and a half with three twists you

1:01:58.760,1:02:03.680
other man my goodness means I come off

1:02:01.730,1:02:06.710
wow what do you know what it's not quite

1:02:03.680,1:02:10.070
the man ninety nine point four five the

1:02:06.710,1:02:14.780
gap between one and two is now one point

1:02:10.070,1:02:17.020
two five points Oh game on come on he

1:02:14.780,1:02:21.080
Chon what have you got in your toy box

1:02:17.020,1:02:24.500
Ching Kai and zakharov are separated by

1:02:21.080,1:02:25.280
one point two five points going into the

1:02:24.500,1:02:26.420
final round

1:02:25.280,1:02:29.000
and there's another Chinese you might

1:02:26.420,1:02:32.540
have ever say about the outcome of this

1:02:29.000,1:02:34.460
competition he is her song board four

1:02:32.540,1:02:36.980
and a half is he aiming for a hundred

1:02:34.460,1:02:39.740
points this time to shake it all up

1:02:36.980,1:02:41.900
oh yes - he needs a hundred points and

1:02:39.740,1:02:43.790
that is going to be very far away at all

1:02:41.900,1:02:44.720
and I can safely say I'm not

1:02:43.790,1:02:46.190
disappointed

1:02:44.720,1:02:48.140
look at that zakharov he's not even

1:02:46.190,1:02:49.670
bothered no point in looking at what you

1:02:48.140,1:02:51.650
can't control let them get on with it

1:02:49.670,1:02:53.810
all I can do is concentrate on my next

1:02:51.650,1:02:57.020
dive and her tongue is soaking up this

1:02:53.810,1:03:00.260
pressure easily completes a dive maybe

1:02:57.020,1:03:02.180
just a fraction over a vertical so or I

1:03:00.260,1:03:03.680
don't know where's he going to be dudes

1:03:02.180,1:03:04.880
have some points to make up so he's

1:03:03.680,1:03:09.130
certainly not going to be top of the

1:03:04.880,1:03:11.540
leaderboard fourth not in the medals yet

1:03:09.130,1:03:15.050
but he's one point behind the Middle's

1:03:11.540,1:03:18.380
Wow that's how tight this competition it

1:03:15.050,1:03:22.359
is unbelievably close for both one and

1:03:18.380,1:03:28.700
two and three and four just look at this

1:03:22.359,1:03:30.230
452 plays 451 for 27 plays for 26 that's

1:03:28.700,1:03:31.880
how it looks for the medals I think

1:03:30.230,1:03:34.820
that's where the medals are gonna go but

1:03:31.880,1:03:37.880
who's gonna get what after counting in

1:03:34.820,1:03:38.660
five troy Dumais in six we've got 3.9

1:03:37.880,1:03:40.550
coming at me

1:03:38.660,1:03:43.490
we talked you through the phone of mine

1:03:40.550,1:03:45.230
dives are those top four as you share

1:03:43.490,1:03:45.560
with us who's at the back yeah Chris

1:03:45.230,1:03:48.290
Meers

1:03:45.560,1:03:50.750

1:03:48.290,1:03:54.290
know just above him in 10th no medals

1:03:50.750,1:03:55.970
today for warrant a party or cabassa so

1:03:54.290,1:03:57.079
the battle for the bonds between oh it

1:03:55.970,1:03:59.750
looks like the Battle of the bonds

1:03:57.079,1:04:02.000
between caste Leo and he Chong so you've

1:03:59.750,1:04:04.040
got a three point seven versus a three

1:04:02.000,1:04:06.109
point nine so it's pretty much die for

1:04:04.040,1:04:07.550
dive the interesting thing is Ching Kai

1:04:06.109,1:04:10.060
and Ilya Zakharov

1:04:07.550,1:04:13.069
Ching Kai only has a three point three

1:04:10.060,1:04:15.230
versus zakharov three point eight that

1:04:13.069,1:04:22.910
he scored a hundred points on in the

1:04:15.230,1:04:25.670
semi-finals or come on boy oh boy is

Ethan Warren for Australia he was a

1:05:40.060,1:05:44.859
battle well he's dived well for the most

1:05:42.550,1:05:46.510
part he's not gonna be featuring in the

somersaults to twist three point four

1:05:50.380,1:05:54.609
degree of difficulty to finish off for

1:05:54.609,1:06:03.790
in the pike position

1:06:14.829,1:06:19.869
really really sterling performance great

1:06:17.950,1:06:22.000
job at the beginning in the field he's

1:06:19.869,1:06:25.800
going to get close to 500 points and

1:06:22.000,1:06:25.800
that is incredible

1:06:27.330,1:06:32.520
let's see what the final score is for

1:06:30.000,1:06:35.870
Ethan Warren it is four hundred eighty

1:06:32.520,1:06:39.600
eight point nine five eighty one point

1:06:35.870,1:06:41.790
600 fine all daimyo is I think other

1:06:39.600,1:06:43.350
competitions and may well have won it

1:06:41.790,1:06:45.330
all got a silver medal but the

1:06:43.350,1:06:48.270
competition so fierce and so intense

1:06:45.330,1:06:50.220
here eighty one point six and four

1:06:48.270,1:06:54.180
eighty eight point nine five not white

1:06:50.220,1:06:55.830
enough probably silver spoon is today

1:06:54.180,1:06:59.070
but he's come through a pack of twenty

1:06:55.830,1:07:05.310
nine to get into the twelve is Xavier

1:06:59.070,1:07:07.650
Garcia the applause from the crowd let

1:07:05.310,1:07:08.850
it die down before they reverse one and

1:07:07.650,1:07:09.900
a half somersaults three and a half

1:07:08.850,1:07:14.370

anybody else I see relatively good died

1:07:14.370,1:07:18.390
for having to finish who did struggle on

1:07:16.050,1:07:21.330
his previous few rounds but as Bob was

1:07:18.390,1:07:23.040

one-and-a-half somersaults three and a

1:07:28.380,1:07:34.620
half twist so good dive to finish on for

1:07:31.080,1:07:37.080
Javy will take his learnings away still

1:07:34.620,1:07:42.180
got some life left in him I'm short will

1:07:37.080,1:07:44.940

1:07:47.610,1:07:52.970
Garcia three eighths and that was him

1:07:50.760,1:07:52.970
dumb

1:07:53.300,1:07:59.480
now our final dive and he has acquitted

1:07:56.120,1:08:02.600
himself brilliantly over three rounds

1:07:59.480,1:08:04.910
and hasn't let anybody down and we'll be

1:08:02.600,1:08:08.210
back for more World Championships next

1:08:04.910,1:08:10.730
year Commonwealth Games in 2014 and the

1:08:08.210,1:08:13.430
next Olympics we hope his body holds

1:08:10.730,1:08:16.220
together for Rio Chris Meers this is his

1:08:13.430,1:08:19.850
big one to finish see it by other people

1:08:16.220,1:08:22.400
how will he do on the Ford four and a

1:08:19.850,1:08:27.680
half somersaults we took 3.8 top of the

1:08:22.400,1:08:29.330
shop for him I want to tie to finish on

1:08:27.680,1:08:30.380
us exactly what he did in the

1:08:29.330,1:08:33.020
semi-finals

1:08:30.380,1:08:35.450
there's his mom and dad and family they

1:08:41.120,1:08:45.950
the semifinals will he match it in the

1:08:43.339,1:08:49.780
final and he has saved the best until

1:08:45.950,1:08:51.920
last this is 3.8 he goes oh so high

1:08:49.780,1:08:54.799
cruising dipping into the water

1:08:51.920,1:08:56.810
marginally over a vertical beautiful rip

1:09:58.130,1:10:03.229
happened to Jack law yesterday in the

1:09:59.929,1:10:05.510
prelims the or the knee-trembler the

1:10:03.229,1:10:07.519
knee buckle I'll show you on the replay

1:10:05.510,1:10:09.860
he's gone to for the big one his knees

1:10:07.519,1:10:12.619
have just given out and the diving board

1:10:09.860,1:10:14.749
he's unbelievable that he managed to to

1:10:12.619,1:10:17.479
manage to complete the dive he will get

1:10:14.749,1:10:19.369
some marks on that Wow drama in this

1:10:17.479,1:10:21.559
last wine look his knees just give out

1:10:19.369,1:10:26.570
there nothing you could do about that

1:10:21.559,1:10:28.489
Oh wall away yeah he's worked so hard to

1:10:26.570,1:10:31.010
get here his head on the diving board

1:10:28.489,1:10:33.380
six weeks ago and that's not the way

1:10:31.010,1:10:36.409
that he wanted to end his Olympic

1:10:33.380,1:10:39.079
campaign here in London I don't think

1:10:36.409,1:10:40.909
there's anything really that we haven't

1:10:39.079,1:10:44.719
seen in this competition preliminaries

1:10:40.909,1:10:49.610
so many fine or or final it's been four

1:10:44.719,1:10:51.920
of unbelievable drama now we're into

1:10:49.610,1:10:54.769
that suspense about who's gonna get the

1:10:51.920,1:10:56.449
medals it won't be this man Elia kabocha

1:10:54.769,1:10:58.939
though he thought he had the pedigree to

1:10:56.449,1:11:00.590
do so to push for Italy's but hasn't

1:10:58.939,1:11:02.780
quite worked out for a forward two and a

1:11:00.590,1:11:05.269
half somersaults two twists three point

1:11:02.780,1:11:07.349
four in the pike position for its final

1:11:05.269,1:11:09.210
dive

1:11:07.349,1:11:10.770
there you go commercial showing you how

1:11:09.210,1:11:12.389
the guys should be done Tea Party

1:11:10.770,1:11:13.139
struggling buckling at the knees

1:11:12.389,1:11:15.960
commercia

1:11:13.139,1:11:18.060
staying with the diving board using it

1:11:15.960,1:11:20.310
rhythm wise here we go

1:11:18.060,1:11:22.889
up he goes one and a half some shots I

1:11:20.310,1:11:24.690
into the double twist turn into the pike

1:11:22.889,1:11:27.630
he's done a reasonable job today throws

1:11:24.690,1:11:30.179
knee kovash up three liam semies and

1:11:27.630,1:11:33.030
here in the final middle of the pack I

1:11:30.179,1:11:38.480
think in the end maybe just above me is

1:11:33.030,1:11:41.010
let's see the mark is eighty six point

1:11:38.480,1:11:42.780
seven yeah a six point seven confirmed

1:11:41.010,1:11:47.400
on the screen eight point five so he

1:11:42.780,1:11:51.929
does move above Chris Meers just behind

1:11:47.400,1:11:53.880
Ethan Warren as he won't wait Barney for

1:11:51.929,1:11:57.710
Warren in the m26 points fine the

1:11:53.880,1:12:00.440
australian sharp end of the competition

1:11:57.710,1:12:04.500
but probably not sharp enough for

1:12:00.440,1:12:08.099
patrick housing to get there this is big

1:12:04.500,1:12:10.170
this big it's 3.7 reverse two and a half

1:12:08.099,1:12:13.349
somersaults two and a half twists for

1:12:10.170,1:12:16.050
the German well how did he manage that

1:12:13.349,1:12:18.030
from the fulcrum end of the diving board

1:12:16.050,1:12:19.560
he's way back from the end of the diving

1:12:18.030,1:12:22.739
board and he has to do one of the most

1:12:19.560,1:12:24.540
complicated dives possible look he's way

1:12:22.739,1:12:27.000
back from the end yes to lean right over

1:12:24.540,1:12:28.860
the diving board oh and he still moves

1:12:27.000,1:12:32.520
it away a safe distance and manages to

1:12:28.860,1:12:36.540
drill the entry Wow I'm running out of

1:12:32.520,1:12:38.310
superlatives a truly terrific it's

1:12:36.540,1:12:40.590
astonishing how he managed to do that I

1:12:38.310,1:12:42.119
am I would give him extra points because

1:12:40.590,1:12:44.340
he was nowhere near the end of the

1:12:42.119,1:12:45.540
diving port three point seven is gonna

1:12:44.340,1:12:51.420
get over 90 points

1:12:45.540,1:12:55.170
it does 94.3 5 iPhone 5 total also to

1:12:51.420,1:12:58.320
find the laws of gravity yeah five oh

1:12:55.170,1:12:59.849
five point five five if you get over 500

1:12:58.320,1:13:04.630
you expect to get a medal normally and

1:12:59.849,1:13:07.270
he probably won't zone Troy do May

1:13:04.630,1:13:10.630
[Applause]

1:13:07.270,1:13:13.390
again enjoying the attention join me

1:13:10.630,1:13:17.660
crowd noise and it has been absolutely

1:13:13.390,1:13:22.160
fever pitch in here tonight last dive

1:13:17.660,1:13:24.770
three point four again forwards two and

1:13:22.160,1:13:30.220
a half several sorts two twists doom a

1:13:24.770,1:13:33.530
trying to get the top five finish I

1:13:30.220,1:13:35.390
finishes on his best IV always favors

1:13:33.530,1:13:38.210
this and that's as good as it gets for

1:13:35.390,1:13:40.400
Troy to mate just a little bit off the

1:13:38.210,1:13:42.020
pace not because of his dive just maybe

1:13:40.400,1:13:44.450
lacking a little bit of degree of

1:13:42.020,1:13:47.180
difficulty but he's going to go close to

1:13:44.450,1:13:48.470
500 Willie nip over it I'm not sure it's

1:13:47.180,1:13:50.630
going to be close but that is a

1:13:48.470,1:13:52.220
beautiful dive to finish the

1:13:50.630,1:13:55.250
all-important entry into the water

1:13:52.220,1:13:58.550
hardly a ripple of splash as he goes in

1:13:55.250,1:14:00.790
yep there's his mama dads they like it

1:13:58.550,1:14:03.050
and I certainly like it well done Troy

1:14:00.790,1:14:07.610
showing secretions to already want an

1:14:03.050,1:14:11.570
Olympic medal here just a little shy of

1:14:07.610,1:14:13.970
the 500 mile but early just 80 8.40

1:14:11.570,1:14:16.610
takes him to four ninety eight point

1:14:13.970,1:14:18.980
three five and for the time being its

1:14:16.610,1:14:20.420
second now how much pressure well that

1:14:18.980,1:14:22.250
was a little nervous look wasn't it

1:14:20.420,1:14:24.430
wasn't it just oh here you go much

1:14:22.250,1:14:30.230
pressure looking up and everything now

1:14:24.430,1:14:33.380
he is there on yellow Castillo Huerta at

1:14:30.230,1:14:35.090
the moment he is in bronze medal

1:14:33.380,1:14:37.730
position but there is no room for

1:14:35.090,1:14:40.910
maneuver and no room for error

1:14:37.730,1:14:43.730
this has to be absolutely spot-on from

1:14:40.910,1:14:46.670
medal you think reverse two-and-a-half

1:14:43.730,1:14:51.220
somersaults to an hour twist could he

1:14:46.670,1:14:51.220
pick up another Mexican middle

1:14:53.520,1:14:58.230
Oh No he has opened the door to none

1:14:57.030,1:15:00.900
other than he Chong

1:14:58.230,1:15:03.180
her Chong there he is he knows what he

1:15:00.900,1:15:06.000
needs to do his name is last Ivan and

1:15:03.180,1:15:07.800
medalists his Yale five out of five in

1:15:06.000,1:15:09.960
his last dive he's gone for the big one

1:15:07.800,1:15:11.550
this is reverse two and a half two and a

1:15:09.960,1:15:13.050
half twist he just skips off the diving

1:15:11.550,1:15:15.330
board a little bit aggressively there

1:15:13.050,1:15:16.830
leaving himself too much to do and he

1:15:15.330,1:15:19.470
lands on his shoulders now that's

1:15:16.830,1:15:21.360
throwing up a lot of splash he could get

1:15:19.470,1:15:23.910
taken out by hosting into Maine maybe

1:15:21.360,1:15:25.830
but I think he had enough buffer what an

1:15:23.910,1:15:27.690
absolute shame he's gone for broke he

1:15:25.830,1:15:30.270
has gone for broke he didn't use this in

1:15:27.690,1:15:32.580
the semis he went for it in a big way no

1:15:30.270,1:15:33.360
maybe it's gonna see him blow out or and

1:15:32.580,1:15:35.670
it does Oh

1:15:33.360,1:15:40.470
he's dropped down below housing and to

1:15:35.670,1:15:45.720
me Wow Oh No after so much good work

1:15:40.470,1:15:53.480
five pretty much impeccable rounds 86 85

1:15:45.720,1:15:57.000
95 8972 bit down on that a 64 Ching Kai

1:15:53.480,1:15:59.660
current leader he's got pressure on him

1:15:57.000,1:16:02.340
from zakharov so he has to get it right

1:15:59.660,1:16:03.960
everybody needs to be right on their

1:16:02.340,1:16:07.830
game now reverse two and a half I've a

1:16:03.960,1:16:09.360
three point three remember only three

1:16:07.830,1:16:12.530
points three but apart from that little

1:16:09.360,1:16:15.180
bit of splash it's absolutely brilliant

1:16:12.530,1:16:16.530
technically needed to be spot-on which

1:16:15.180,1:16:18.900
it was he landed on the end of the

1:16:16.530,1:16:21.360
diving boards no mistakes here on the

1:16:18.900,1:16:23.040
take-off one and a half twist fault into

1:16:21.360,1:16:25.080
that Pike shape and apart from this

1:16:23.040,1:16:27.720
little bit of splash that's a perfectly

1:16:25.080,1:16:30.180
vertical entry I don't think he's gonna

1:16:27.720,1:16:31.350
get much change out of nines maybe the

1:16:30.180,1:16:34.740
judges would go with him and give him

1:16:31.350,1:16:39.810
9.5 s and that puts the pressure firmly

1:16:34.740,1:16:43.260
on zakharov the only diver two divers to

1:16:39.810,1:16:44.880
go Ching Kai loves it shaking his fist

1:16:43.260,1:16:48.330
how much does he like it now it's the

1:16:44.880,1:16:52.500
judges like it eighty-nine point one

1:16:48.330,1:16:58.260
zero I make it the zakharov has to get

1:16:52.500,1:17:02.460
91 with his dive to overtake him in the

1:16:58.260,1:17:06.050
region of 91 now 541 I just written that

1:17:02.460,1:17:10.290
down just to make sure 541 now

1:17:06.050,1:17:11.180
what can this man do he needs

1:17:10.290,1:17:12.340
[Applause]

1:17:11.180,1:17:23.330
[Music]

1:17:12.340,1:17:25.370
19.4 90.4 required to win for Ilya

1:17:23.330,1:17:27.710
Zakharov it's a three point 82 this

1:17:25.370,1:17:31.730
perfectly this morning forward four and

1:17:27.710,1:17:34.640
a half summer sorts with tuck that's

1:17:31.730,1:17:37.310
gold for Russia that is definitely gold

1:17:34.640,1:17:38.720
for Russia China have not had it all the

1:17:37.310,1:17:40.490
wrong way look at the British team

1:17:38.720,1:17:44.750
jumping up there they are appreciative

1:17:40.490,1:17:47.180
of this super special Russian diver he

1:17:44.750,1:17:50.510
is the Olympic champion I can tell you

1:17:47.180,1:17:53.120
before the scores come up this is no no

1:17:50.510,1:17:55.370
that's unbelievable what a dive to

1:17:53.120,1:17:57.410
finish on probably coast to 100 points

1:17:55.370,1:17:59.930
like he did in the semi finals this

1:17:57.410,1:18:03.710
morning I take my hat off to you sucker

1:17:59.930,1:18:05.240
off you are the man you are the man

1:18:03.710,1:18:06.620
we're waiting for the mark of the

1:18:05.240,1:18:08.960
crowler waiting for the mark he's

1:18:06.620,1:18:12.590
waiting for the mark just confirmation

1:18:08.960,1:18:14.750
surely over Russian gold his time again

1:18:12.590,1:18:18.200
he's done it again

1:18:14.750,1:18:20.270
even better than before no perfect tense

1:18:18.200,1:18:23.240
will count sadly because that will have

1:18:20.270,1:18:27.830
put the tin lid on it and confirmed but

1:18:23.240,1:18:32.270
104 point five zero that is immense and

1:18:27.830,1:18:35.510
impeccable five five five point nine

1:18:32.270,1:18:38.180
zero that is in a completely different

1:18:35.510,1:18:40.420
stratosphere in this competition I

1:18:38.180,1:18:44.870
cannot believe what I've just seen there

1:18:40.420,1:18:48.920
zakharov stops the chinese gold rush

1:18:44.870,1:18:50.480
or does he yeah course it's possible for

1:18:48.920,1:18:52.930
her Chong to get anything better than

1:18:50.480,1:18:55.450
bronze but that is wide open for him now

1:18:52.930,1:19:03.140
wide open

1:18:55.450,1:19:06.530
Chong leads 80 really my calculations

1:19:03.140,1:19:08.240
are right he needs 80 so providing this

1:19:06.530,1:19:10.430
goes well three point nine degree of

1:19:08.240,1:19:13.709
difficulty that should take him

1:19:10.430,1:19:16.380
comfortably saving over that mark

1:19:13.709,1:19:17.969
yeah that'll get him because it's such a

1:19:16.380,1:19:19.559
big degree of difficulty he's been a

1:19:17.969,1:19:21.780
little bit off his game today

1:19:19.559,1:19:24.150
yeah no danger for you psycho off you

1:19:21.780,1:19:26.789
are the Olympic champion her Chong that

1:19:24.150,1:19:29.400
is good enough for bronze gold four

1:19:26.789,1:19:32.280
years ago long time four years this is

1:19:29.400,1:19:35.070
the polite for two and a half three

1:19:32.280,1:19:37.920
twist is a big degree of difficulty 3.9

1:19:35.070,1:19:40.880
her Chong will see himself on the podium

1:19:37.920,1:19:43.979
but not in the position he wanted to be

1:19:40.880,1:19:45.749
qualified top for this final ends up

1:19:43.979,1:19:50.340
being beaten by his country low country

1:19:45.749,1:19:53.909
munching CAI and truly outstanding Ilya

1:19:50.340,1:19:58.619
Zakharov the world champion is no longer

1:19:53.909,1:20:01.739
the Olympic champion 97.5 zero it is

1:19:58.619,1:20:07.409
good enough for third and no better for

1:20:01.739,1:20:11.550
her Chong and the old order has been

1:20:07.409,1:20:13.110
overturned China have won five golds

1:20:11.550,1:20:17.249
they're not going to win six in a row

1:20:13.110,1:20:20.729
because Ilya Zakharov has done it again

1:20:17.249,1:20:24.650
with the most immense sixth round dive

1:20:20.729,1:20:28.170
with a hundred and four point five zero

1:20:24.650,1:20:30.389
look at King Kai he's giving it his all

1:20:28.170,1:20:32.489
look at that 541 and that's not good

1:20:30.389,1:20:35.099
enough to win the gold look at this

1:20:32.489,1:20:37.380
elation and devastation the camera just

1:20:35.099,1:20:39.209
cut for one to the other someone

1:20:37.380,1:20:41.159
achieves her dream and another one loses

1:20:39.209,1:20:42.900
it all in the same instant welcome to

1:20:41.159,1:20:44.989
the Olympic Games let me just give me

1:20:42.900,1:20:48.300
the sequins and marks for Ilya Zakharov

1:20:44.989,1:20:50.900
eighty-five ninety one eighty nine point

1:20:48.300,1:20:54.420
two five eighty six point seven zero

1:20:50.900,1:20:57.780
ninety nine point four five one oh four

1:20:54.420,1:20:59.489
point five zero now perhaps he knows how

1:20:57.780,1:21:02.099
the rest of them feel because always

1:20:59.489,1:21:03.840
Chinese gold or seems to me anyway but

1:21:02.099,1:21:07.300
not this time round the world champion

1:21:03.840,1:21:09.770
is not the Olympic champion

1:21:07.300,1:21:11.900
amazing scenes here at the diving points

1:21:09.770,1:21:14.840
eating chi there in tears this is how

1:21:11.900,1:21:17.630
much it means to these athletes what a

1:21:14.840,1:21:21.470
treat for the spectators here to watch

1:21:17.630,1:21:24.290
that now let me just tell you 555 that

1:21:21.470,1:21:27.860
is unbelievable I have never seen diving

1:21:24.290,1:21:29.570
like that just 21 years old Ilya

1:21:27.860,1:21:30.980
Zakharov I don't think he's going

1:21:29.570,1:21:33.830
anywhere for a bit looks a little bit

1:21:30.980,1:21:37.160
like to meet you the great multi Olympic

1:21:33.830,1:21:39.530
gold winning medallist here his hero and

1:21:37.160,1:21:41.660
I'm not surprised he walks like he talks

1:21:39.530,1:21:44.570
like him and he certainly dives better

1:21:41.660,1:21:48.620
than him dare I say what an athlete and

1:21:44.570,1:21:50.240
what a contest well I don't think that

1:21:48.620,1:21:52.880
smiles going to come off his face for a

1:21:50.240,1:21:56.030
little while and all surely that is

1:21:52.880,1:21:58.100
amazing 21 years of age didn't even come

1:21:56.030,1:22:02.360
close to dropping a dive in that

1:21:58.100,1:22:04.130
sequence of six China have to settle and

1:22:02.360,1:22:05.390
be satisfied whether they're not of

1:22:04.130,1:22:08.470
course which you can tell by their

1:22:05.390,1:22:13.360
expressions with silver and two bronze

1:22:08.470,1:22:15.790
because that gold is returning to Russia

1:22:13.360,1:22:19.550
he can't quite believe it

1:22:15.790,1:22:22.070
the crowd are delighted to see something

1:22:19.550,1:22:25.220
a little bit different bat in the diving

1:22:22.070,1:22:27.430
pool and plenty of support that one I'm

1:22:25.220,1:22:31.220
Celia Cash's support group are now

1:22:27.430,1:22:32.270
adopting second off they can't get the

1:22:31.220,1:22:34.510
t-shirts made up that quickly

1:22:32.270,1:22:34.510
unfortunately

1:22:38.820,1:22:48.480
Ilya Zakharov is the winner five 55.90

1:22:45.930,1:22:53.070
it's just as amazing as I'm saying I

1:22:48.480,1:22:55.080
can't believe it Ching Kai her Chong one

1:22:53.070,1:22:57.750
two three patrick housing missing out by

1:22:55.080,1:22:58.410
one was twenty marks on the bronze troy

1:22:57.750,1:23:00.600
do mate

1:22:58.410,1:23:03.750
yeah castillo Huerta who threw it away

1:23:00.600,1:23:07.170
last dive through a chance of a medal

1:23:03.750,1:23:09.030
away and where did Chris Meers finish in

1:23:07.170,1:23:10.950
the end look he's made up to ninth place

1:23:09.030,1:23:12.270
with that terrific last dive that's

1:23:10.950,1:23:14.820
where he came in and that's where he

1:23:12.270,1:23:17.400
goes out in ninth place for thirty-nine

1:23:14.820,1:23:19.560
point seven five his day will come again

1:23:17.400,1:23:22.610
and it'd be much further up the pecking

1:23:19.560,1:23:22.610
order next time

1:23:35.539,1:23:40.760
right deep breath time everybody because

1:23:38.570,1:23:42.440
that is astonishing work we've kind of

1:23:40.760,1:23:46.519
been building up the Timmy's or is the

1:23:42.440,1:23:48.739
big climatic event of these Olympic

1:23:46.519,1:23:51.170
Games in diving but I tell you what the

1:23:48.739,1:23:55.039
10 is going to take some going to beat

1:23:51.170,1:24:00.170
that is it not well let's just wait and

1:23:55.039,1:24:02.929
see we have been treated to just contest

1:24:00.170,1:24:05.539
after contest if they're well the

1:24:02.929,1:24:07.219
highest performances and some well those

1:24:05.539,1:24:09.590
all sorts in that competition from start

1:24:07.219,1:24:11.150
to finish wasn't there so I you know the

1:24:09.590,1:24:14.179
platform is a blue-ribbon event the

1:24:11.150,1:24:16.400
women start tomorrow evening in the

1:24:14.179,1:24:19.670
polymer ease and then the men get to

1:24:16.400,1:24:22.670
close late on Saturday night local time

1:24:19.670,1:24:24.380
and I'm just taking each Drive at a time

1:24:22.670,1:24:27.199
in each contest at a time because it is

1:24:24.380,1:24:29.360
an absolute treat I've been involved in

1:24:27.199,1:24:30.110
this sport since you know I was eight

1:24:29.360,1:24:32.809
years old

1:24:30.110,1:24:35.179
and it just gets better and better and

1:24:32.809,1:24:37.369
better and I hope you enjoying it all

1:24:35.179,1:24:39.139
over the world because we certainly are

1:24:37.369,1:24:41.659
here we've got a best seat in the house

1:24:39.139,1:24:44.539
we've also got two microphones to bring

1:24:41.659,1:24:45.199
it alive so I hope you enjoyed it as

1:24:44.539,1:24:47.900
much as we are

1:24:45.199,1:24:49.579
does Ilya Zakharov have ice running

1:24:47.900,1:24:51.739
through his veins out they they are in a

1:24:49.579,1:24:53.539
situation you know that you got your

1:24:51.739,1:24:55.219
biggest dive to come you know if you do

1:24:53.539,1:24:57.739
it well you're a little bit gold

1:24:55.219,1:24:59.900
medalist but there's no sign of nerves

1:24:57.739,1:25:01.039
he bettered what he did the semi-final

1:24:59.900,1:25:03.860
we thought that was pretty exceptional

1:25:01.039,1:25:05.719
he's actually gone beyond that yeah well

1:25:03.860,1:25:08.179
that's what to true champions you know

1:25:05.719,1:25:10.130
become Olympic champion by not being

1:25:08.179,1:25:12.110
able to hold it together in the greatest

1:25:10.130,1:25:13.670
arena that there is you know this

1:25:12.110,1:25:15.230
gladiatorial out there there's

1:25:13.670,1:25:17.750
everyone's staring at you you're

1:25:15.230,1:25:20.119
standing there on the diving board all

1:25:17.750,1:25:22.400
those years and years and thousands and

1:25:20.119,1:25:25.130
thousands of dives in training come down

1:25:22.400,1:25:27.409
to this one moment in time one dive at a

1:25:25.130,1:25:28.820
time each of those six dives counts and

1:25:27.409,1:25:30.679
it's important that you nail all of them

1:25:28.820,1:25:32.960
so Yale castilho my heart goes out to

1:25:30.679,1:25:34.969
him because that final dive he went for

1:25:32.960,1:25:37.039
broke that was a big dive he upped the

1:25:34.969,1:25:38.570
ante Ted and even more complicated dive

1:25:37.039,1:25:41.239
that he did in the semi finals

1:25:38.570,1:25:43.280
they went for broke and unfortunately he

1:25:41.239,1:25:44.800
broke he didn't do it he didn't nail it

1:25:43.280,1:25:47.869
and he ended up outside the medals

1:25:44.800,1:25:49.490
whereas Ilya Zakharov from the start

1:25:47.869,1:25:51.440
opened up with his easiest

1:25:49.490,1:25:53.090
dive in his easiest dive is three point

1:25:51.440,1:25:55.640
four degree of difficulty that is

1:25:53.090,1:25:58.850
normally the most difficult dive he is a

1:25:55.640,1:26:01.040
cut above and what an amazing

1:25:58.850,1:26:03.130
performance and to do it here when it

1:26:01.040,1:26:06.610
counts in school

1:26:03.130,1:26:08.570
555 that is Wow

1:26:06.610,1:26:10.370
unbelievable can we be a little bit

1:26:08.570,1:26:11.810
parochial for a little while those

1:26:10.370,1:26:14.120
around the world I hope you won't mind

1:26:11.810,1:26:16.160
our self indulge us a bit only to die

1:26:14.120,1:26:18.260
was well over a hundred today one of

1:26:16.160,1:26:19.970
them was British yeah very good from

1:26:18.260,1:26:22.490
Chris you know he's got a lot of work to

1:26:19.970,1:26:23.930
do on his list and his consistency the

1:26:22.490,1:26:25.520
reverse turn off somersaults in the

1:26:23.930,1:26:27.110
second round led him down otherwise he'd

1:26:25.520,1:26:29.510
have been even higher up four thirty

1:26:27.110,1:26:31.250
nine he's a very very good score but

1:26:29.510,1:26:32.780
what he has shown his bursts of

1:26:31.250,1:26:34.640
brilliance and that was in the end of

1:26:32.780,1:26:36.800
the semi-final to secure his berth in

1:26:34.640,1:26:38.360
this final and then he finished up on a

1:26:36.800,1:26:40.190
real treat for the home crowd wasn't he

1:26:38.360,1:26:42.320
I can't believe how noisy it is in here

1:26:40.190,1:26:44.270
I think I get used to it and then I get

1:26:42.320,1:26:46.580
surprised every time a member of Team GB

1:26:44.270,1:26:48.470
stands on the diving board and I could

1:26:46.580,1:26:50.960
only begin to imagine what it might be

1:26:48.470,1:26:52.490
like as the week goes on fantastic

1:26:50.960,1:26:53.840
support in here people are loving their

1:26:52.490,1:26:56.270
diving's we're gaining all the love on

1:26:53.840,1:26:57.830
Twitter from around the world so thank

1:26:56.270,1:27:00.110
you for that and we'll continue to work

1:26:57.830,1:27:02.420
hard to bring it alive and explain some

1:27:00.110,1:27:04.610
of the nuances and idiosyncrasies of the

1:27:02.420,1:27:06.170
sport but the divers are doing all the

1:27:04.610,1:27:07.640
talking aren't they my goodness me we

1:27:06.170,1:27:10.460
don't have to do very much at all when

1:27:07.640,1:27:12.680
the diving is that good from the from

1:27:10.460,1:27:15.200
the home athletes as well as all of

1:27:12.680,1:27:17.900
these fantastic divers from all around

1:27:15.200,1:27:18.290
the world and you know let's go through

1:27:17.900,1:27:21.680
it again

1:27:18.290,1:27:24.020
that is the first gold that hasn't gone

1:27:21.680,1:27:25.820
to China in the 2012 Olympic Games in

1:27:24.020,1:27:27.530
the diving pool now that is quite

1:27:25.820,1:27:29.840
something everyone was you know

1:27:27.530,1:27:32.720
predicting a clean sweep and it's been

1:27:29.840,1:27:33.800
stopped on event number six actually I

1:27:32.720,1:27:35.540
think this is the one that most people

1:27:33.800,1:27:36.140
thought was the strongest the whole lot

1:27:35.540,1:27:38.000
wasn't it

1:27:36.140,1:27:39.830
yeah one of the strongest I you know I

1:27:38.000,1:27:41.360
wouldn't ever underestimate Sackhoff and

1:27:39.830,1:27:43.040
he split the Chinese last year in

1:27:41.360,1:27:45.020
Shanghai so I'd say they're probably

1:27:43.040,1:27:46.910
dominance is stronger in the women's

1:27:45.020,1:27:49.790
events than the men's I think the mint

1:27:46.910,1:27:51.890
is more open maybe you know dare I say

1:27:49.790,1:27:54.290
the closed event the blue ribbon event

1:27:51.890,1:27:56.650
the men's platform you know is the door

1:27:54.290,1:27:59.860
open the rest of the world believe and

1:27:56.650,1:28:01.930
you know if you can do it I can do it

1:27:59.860,1:28:03.370
just get mad-- to Chris Meers for a

1:28:01.930,1:28:07.210
moment before we move on to other things

1:28:03.370,1:28:09.310
for 61 in the semi 439 in a finally

1:28:07.210,1:28:11.920
actually dropped down by 22 but actually

1:28:09.310,1:28:14.320
finished in the same place so in terms

1:28:11.920,1:28:15.520
our position exactly the same will he be

1:28:14.320,1:28:16.930
a little bit disappointed he's not

1:28:15.520,1:28:18.370
better than what he didn't assent me

1:28:16.930,1:28:19.900
when when marks do tend to be a bit

1:28:18.370,1:28:21.400
higher in the final generally yeah of

1:28:19.900,1:28:23.680
course he made some mistakes the second

1:28:21.400,1:28:25.390
vandiver's I highlighted in our previous

1:28:23.680,1:28:28.600
conversation you know he was down on

1:28:25.390,1:28:30.490
that a few other slight errors but you

1:28:28.600,1:28:31.930
know his job was to make it to the final

1:28:30.490,1:28:34.150
and enjoy it and that's exactly what he

1:28:31.930,1:28:36.040
did he handled the occasion he handled

1:28:34.150,1:28:38.110
himself you know superbly

1:28:36.040,1:28:40.150
under the pressure under the expectation

1:28:38.110,1:28:41.860
he smiled he enjoyed it and he let his

1:28:40.150,1:28:44.380
diving do the talking he's only 19 years

1:28:41.860,1:28:46.300
old he's got a lot of years ahead of him

1:28:44.380,1:28:48.240
I want a fantastic first Olympic

1:28:46.300,1:28:50.710
experience fifth in the synchronized

1:28:48.240,1:28:53.140
springboard event and then he's come out

1:28:50.710,1:28:56.050
and nailed it ninth in this individual

1:28:53.140,1:28:57.820
Wow I take my hat off very good indeed

1:28:56.050,1:28:59.410
why don't Chris me is how you feeling

1:28:57.820,1:29:01.600
for your good mate your very close

1:28:59.410,1:29:03.520
friend Alex day party didn't quite

1:29:01.600,1:29:05.410
finish or go out the way he wanted to a

1:29:03.520,1:29:08.020
tough day at the office for Alex you

1:29:05.410,1:29:08.500
know and he's had a really tough four

1:29:08.020,1:29:10.930
years

1:29:08.500,1:29:12.700
injury after injury after injury never

1:29:10.930,1:29:14.830
really seemed to get back into his

1:29:12.700,1:29:17.080
rhythm and really start to shine after

1:29:14.830,1:29:18.520
his silver medal in Beijing and that's

1:29:17.080,1:29:20.260
sometimes what happens he's been the top

1:29:18.520,1:29:23.590
of his game since he was 13 years old

1:29:20.260,1:29:25.060
way back in 1998 and here today you know

1:29:23.590,1:29:27.310
just goes to show it could happen to

1:29:25.060,1:29:29.950
anyone his last round dive instead of

1:29:27.310,1:29:31.870
getting 82 Plus which is what we

1:29:29.950,1:29:33.730
normally expect maybe even in the 90s

1:29:31.870,1:29:35.710
when he's on his game he got 22 points

1:29:33.730,1:29:37.360
and he's very fortunate to get that at a

1:29:35.710,1:29:40.000
complete knee buckle and we saw what

1:29:37.360,1:29:41.620
happens yesterday in the preliminaries

1:29:40.000,1:29:43.780
Jack Lord had completely buckle and

1:29:41.620,1:29:45.610
didn't even manage his dive completely

1:29:43.780,1:29:48.130
failed the dive and we saw Stefan feck

1:29:45.610,1:29:50.170
who slipped off the diving board so you

1:29:48.130,1:29:51.940
know it happens to everyone including

1:29:50.170,1:29:54.490
Olympic silver medalist from the

1:29:51.940,1:29:56.050
previous two games Alexandre de Partie

1:29:54.490,1:29:58.750
and of course my heart goes out to him

1:29:56.050,1:30:01.480
what a truly extraordinary athlete maybe

1:29:58.750,1:30:03.190
he'll you know retire after this it's

1:30:01.480,1:30:04.930
you know I'm sure that's his decision

1:30:03.190,1:30:07.000
and his announcement to make

1:30:04.930,1:30:08.200
and I certainly want to be speaking for

1:30:07.000,1:30:10.630
him I know that he would have wanted to

1:30:08.200,1:30:12.700
go out on a high so let's wait and see

1:30:10.630,1:30:13.160
see how he feels see what options he's

1:30:12.700,1:30:15.560
got

1:30:13.160,1:30:17.270
but he's you know world champion Olympic

1:30:15.560,1:30:18.860
silver medalist he's got absolutely

1:30:17.270,1:30:20.240
everything on his multiple Commonwealth

1:30:18.860,1:30:22.220
medalist he's got everything under his

1:30:20.240,1:30:24.170
belt one of the world's greatest divers

1:30:22.220,1:30:25.880
ever let's talk about the young guns

1:30:24.170,1:30:27.770
we've mentioned Chris Meers what about

1:30:25.880,1:30:29.360
Ethan Warren I think he's impressed you

1:30:27.770,1:30:31.040
press here the Commonwealth Games name

1:30:29.360,1:30:32.870
is pretty consistent again tonight yeah

1:30:31.040,1:30:34.400
absolutely he's just got better and

1:30:32.870,1:30:36.950
better he's turned up the ante you know

1:30:34.400,1:30:38.840
turned it up each time so prelims he was

1:30:36.950,1:30:40.880
in the mix semi finals he moved up

1:30:38.840,1:30:43.250
further into the mix and then final what

1:30:40.880,1:30:46.610
did he end up with 488 it's a big score

1:30:43.250,1:30:48.500
I mean it's it's shadowed by the where

1:30:46.610,1:30:50.630
would he come 7th yeah the top six will

1:30:48.500,1:30:52.250
ride out there 488 you know you'd expect

1:30:50.630,1:30:54.650
to be closer to the medals with that but

1:30:52.250,1:30:58.970
well not today not in the London Olympic

1:30:54.650,1:30:59.900
final for divers over 500 have we ever

1:30:58.970,1:31:02.540
seen that before

1:30:59.900,1:31:05.390
well not in Olympic Games for sure maybe

1:31:02.540,1:31:07.160
in a in a Grand Prix around the world

1:31:05.390,1:31:08.750
when the judging is more elevated you

1:31:07.160,1:31:10.910
might see that's why we can't have World

1:31:08.750,1:31:13.550
Records in diving because the judging

1:31:10.910,1:31:16.130
scores vary it depends you know how much

1:31:13.550,1:31:17.990
of a how much guidance they're giving

1:31:16.130,1:31:20.540
out the facts sometimes the the

1:31:17.990,1:31:21.920
powers-that-be would say okay judges you

1:31:20.540,1:31:23.780
need to be really strict on this

1:31:21.920,1:31:26.030
particular element of the dive so if you

1:31:23.780,1:31:27.470
see anyone with a split tuck shape

1:31:26.030,1:31:29.480
that's a tuck shape with their knees

1:31:27.470,1:31:30.920
wide apart make sure you penalize them

1:31:29.480,1:31:32.330
and you know it depends and that can

1:31:30.920,1:31:33.740
really influence the marks I think the

1:31:32.330,1:31:35.930
judging here has been very consistent

1:31:33.740,1:31:37.730
though Bob normally we have a bit more

1:31:35.930,1:31:40.160
of a rant about the judging but I think

1:31:37.730,1:31:42.800
here well have knowed you rant once

1:31:40.160,1:31:44.120
actually but we did maybe once or twice

1:31:42.800,1:31:45.830
you've had one but I've certainly been

1:31:44.120,1:31:47.390
very comfortable with the judging you

1:31:45.830,1:31:48.950
know there's you know the measures were

1:31:47.390,1:31:50.690
in place they take away the two highest

1:31:48.950,1:31:52.700
and the two lowest to leave the three

1:31:50.690,1:31:54.470
middle scores trying to advocate out all

1:31:52.700,1:31:57.140
the time in the synchro even more

1:31:54.470,1:31:59.780
complex but the intention is to try and

1:31:57.140,1:32:01.970
give to take away that subjectivity as

1:31:59.780,1:32:04.070
much as they can and try and averaged

1:32:01.970,1:32:05.990
out the scores before it is of course

1:32:04.070,1:32:07.940
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

1:32:05.990,1:32:10.820
and boy oh boy did we see some degrees

1:32:07.940,1:32:13.370
of difficulty here and all this week and

1:32:10.820,1:32:15.020
more to come of course with the with the

1:32:13.370,1:32:17.390
platform events to finish off this

1:32:15.020,1:32:19.490
extraordinary Olympic Games are we gonna

1:32:17.390,1:32:21.560
see four I was three point nine as far

1:32:19.490,1:32:23.510
as it's gonna go well they're you know

1:32:21.560,1:32:25.670
they're mathematically calculate a ball

1:32:23.510,1:32:26.389
if there's that's a made-up word they're

1:32:25.670,1:32:28.340
you know

1:32:26.389,1:32:30.110
yeah you can look at it it's almost like

1:32:28.340,1:32:32.030
a computer game if you can fit the spins

1:32:30.110,1:32:34.489
in there's a degree of difficulty which

1:32:32.030,1:32:36.679
will go next to it but at the moment 3.9

1:32:34.489,1:32:39.800
that's pushing the ceiling as far as I'm

1:32:36.679,1:32:41.750
concerned well we've been living off the

1:32:39.800,1:32:44.420
ceiling and on the ceiling during the

1:32:41.750,1:32:46.520
course of the evening and they were just

1:32:44.420,1:32:48.679
about to come down to Terra Firma after

1:32:46.520,1:32:51.080
what we've just seen I guess yeah you

1:32:48.679,1:32:53.480
got it right if you just tuned in in the

1:32:51.080,1:32:56.300
center of your screen is not a Chinese

1:32:53.480,1:32:59.840
diver yes to your left and to your right

1:32:56.300,1:33:03.170
but position that number one is occupied

1:32:59.840,1:33:05.030
by a Russian and how often do we see

1:33:03.170,1:33:09.230
this when the presentation part is

1:33:05.030,1:33:10.280
obviously agreed in advance this happens

1:33:09.230,1:33:13.190
all the time

1:33:10.280,1:33:14.420
they suspect it'll be a Chinese gold and

1:33:13.190,1:33:16.570
it's not a Russian who's could present

1:33:14.420,1:33:16.570
it

1:33:21.810,1:33:29.610
the Chinese presentation party

1:33:25.250,1:33:32.670
redick weird also some assistance from

1:33:29.610,1:33:36.030
Margot Mountjoy executive board member

1:33:32.670,1:33:38.760
of the governing body for water sports

1:33:36.030,1:33:41.370
around the world swimming diving water

1:33:38.760,1:33:43.110
polo open water and synchronized

1:33:41.370,1:33:44.390
swimming which is also taking place in

1:33:43.110,1:33:48.570
this very poor

1:33:44.390,1:33:50.640
that's the presentation party it seems

1:33:48.570,1:33:52.860
to me that India zakharov cannot wait to

1:33:50.640,1:33:57.810
stand up flat for me sir

1:33:52.860,1:33:59.160
jumpy around like a hyperactive kid I'm

1:33:57.810,1:34:08.070
sure you see much of a smile from her

1:33:59.160,1:34:11.550
Chong the world champion and Olympic

1:34:08.070,1:34:13.770
champion from Beijing muster a smile

1:34:11.550,1:34:16.260
because bronze is not what he came here

1:34:13.770,1:34:17.490
for and he was a fool there's somebody

1:34:16.260,1:34:19.830
sitting right you only get five hundred

1:34:17.490,1:34:21.240
and twenty four point one five points

1:34:19.830,1:34:23.850
who said yeah that's fine I'll take that

1:34:21.240,1:34:26.760
cuz that's gonna be a gold medal not on

1:34:23.850,1:34:30.060
this occasion it wasn't any good enough

1:34:26.760,1:34:33.300
for bronze if fatty was seventeen point

1:34:30.060,1:34:35.430
shy of silver and 31 points away from

1:34:33.300,1:34:37.770
gold it wasn't close just about

1:34:35.430,1:34:42.060
mustering a smile or regret their smile

1:34:37.770,1:34:48.270
really from her Chong his bronze for

1:34:42.060,1:34:49.440
China and it was silver for China here's

1:34:48.270,1:34:51.060
somebody who missed out on the medal

1:34:49.440,1:34:54.540
last year the World Championships in

1:34:51.060,1:34:59.400
fourth place he's gone to better this

1:34:54.540,1:35:00.840
time Ching Kai of China know he's

1:34:59.400,1:35:03.710
punching in the air think he's a bit

1:35:00.840,1:35:05.790
more happy with that than her charm

1:35:03.710,1:35:08.340
maybe thought he's gonna be a sole

1:35:05.790,1:35:10.260
medalist anyway didn't expect it to be a

1:35:08.340,1:35:14.460
Russian who beat him to the first place

1:35:10.260,1:35:17.840
yeah nice big a smile from the top

1:35:14.460,1:35:17.840
ranked Chinese this time

1:35:18.490,1:35:23.110
I think there might be a bit of a raw in

1:35:20.830,1:35:24.610
this building when the gold medalist is

1:35:23.110,1:35:29.380
announced so are people to stay behind

1:35:24.610,1:35:31.660
for the metal ceremony to acclaim well

1:35:29.380,1:35:33.160
not totally unexpected gold medalists he

1:35:31.660,1:35:35.830
was the silver medalist at the World

1:35:33.160,1:35:38.620
Championships in Shanghai last year but

1:35:35.830,1:35:42.180
he has gone one better with five hundred

1:35:38.620,1:35:47.760
and fifty five point nine zero points

1:35:42.180,1:35:53.500
astonishing and remarkable Ilya Zakharov

1:35:47.760,1:36:06.550
of Russia 21 years of age is the Olympic

1:35:53.500,1:36:10.030
men's 3-meter springboard champion big

1:36:06.550,1:36:12.250
gold medal goes around his neck it's

1:36:10.030,1:36:18.760
alighted to take the acclaim of the

1:36:12.250,1:36:20.890
crowd he will be a powerhouse and a

1:36:18.760,1:36:22.750
force to be reckoned with as long as the

1:36:20.890,1:36:25.750
body holds together for the next few

1:36:22.750,1:36:28.560
years he will be pushing and the Chinese

1:36:25.750,1:36:32.050
as he pushed them out the way today

1:36:28.560,1:36:35.590
India zakharov breaks the stranglehold

1:36:32.050,1:36:39.100
of the Chinese in diving events at

1:36:35.590,1:36:44.160
London 2012 and we will hear for the

1:36:39.100,1:36:44.160
first time the Russian national anthem

1:37:01.590,1:37:04.699

1:37:28.660,1:37:47.729

1:37:54.660,1:38:02.230
remember that face remember the name

1:37:58.020,1:38:05.050
India zakharov the man who ended Chinese

1:38:02.230,1:38:08.590
domination in the men's 3-meter

1:38:05.050,1:38:11.170
springboard final with astonishing one

1:38:08.590,1:38:14.380
hundred and four point five zero eyes

1:38:11.170,1:38:16.300
final dive an overall total of five

1:38:14.380,1:38:19.540
hundred and fifty five point nine zero

1:38:16.300,1:38:22.540
we think it was close fourteen points

1:38:19.540,1:38:24.610
virtually separating first and second so

1:38:22.540,1:38:26.920
he did it his way he did the hard way

1:38:24.610,1:38:30.700
and he did it with that spectacular

1:38:26.920,1:38:34.660
final dive he'll have him immortalized

1:38:30.700,1:38:37.210
in Russian diving history last word for

1:38:34.660,1:38:39.280

because if the diving continues at this

1:38:56.560,1:39:01.900
kind of standard which I'm pretty

1:38:58.300,1:39:04.960
confident it will Wow good words to

1:39:01.900,1:39:07.330
