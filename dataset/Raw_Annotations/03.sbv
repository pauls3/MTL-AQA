set out in hope at 7 o'clock last night

0:00:06.029,0:00:11.190
now we're down to the best 12 after the

0:00:08.820,0:00:13.650
Smalling semi-final reduced the number

0:00:11.190,0:00:15.839
down from 18 with defending champion

0:00:13.650,0:00:17.850
Matthew Mitchum without doubt the

0:00:15.839,0:00:21.350
big-name to miss out on tonight's final

0:00:17.850,0:00:24.840

out in force tonight

0:01:29.420,0:01:34.430
well will he be inhibited or will he be

0:01:31.720,0:01:36.470
inspired David Boudia the American next

0:01:34.430,0:01:38.479
to him enjoying the occasion and

0:01:36.470,0:01:40.300
reveling in the atmosphere that's great

0:01:38.479,0:01:43.850
to see

0:01:40.300,0:01:46.820
but those supporters will know that it's

0:01:43.850,0:01:49.340
the Chinese duo have lent you here and

0:01:46.820,0:01:51.380
Cubo next to him we've been setting the

0:01:49.340,0:01:53.840
standards right from the off as they

0:01:51.380,0:01:57.130
chase their country's seventh diving

0:01:53.840,0:02:01.729
gold medal of the games his chuubo

0:01:57.130,0:02:04.970
leading after the semi finals and the

0:02:01.729,0:02:07.009
favorite for gold the six for those 12

0:02:04.970,0:02:10.009
finalists the Olympic Games is a new

0:02:07.009,0:02:11.750
experience unlike for Steve for

0:02:10.009,0:02:13.190
billiards sitting next to me Steve

0:02:11.750,0:02:15.440
you've been studying the scores over the

0:02:13.190,0:02:17.780
two rounds so far I mean how much is the

0:02:15.440,0:02:19.700
standard just built as this competition

0:02:17.780,0:02:21.830
has progressed I think it's really

0:02:19.700,0:02:23.390
significant Roger that from the men in

0:02:21.830,0:02:26.209
the top 12 who have qualified for this

0:02:23.390,0:02:28.820
final the lowest dive score in the semi

0:02:26.209,0:02:30.769
was 72 in that from Riley McCormick and

0:02:28.820,0:02:32.900
even that score dates but with a low

0:02:30.769,0:02:34.940
tariff so the consistency has really

0:02:32.900,0:02:36.799
been building in the preliminaries we

0:02:34.940,0:02:39.230
saw dives in the 30s and even a couple

0:02:36.799,0:02:41.660
in the 20s the lifting consistency for

0:02:39.230,0:02:43.670
the second phase of the competition was

0:02:41.660,0:02:45.950
remarkable and and now what we're

0:02:43.670,0:02:47.930
looking for is consistency with high

0:02:45.950,0:02:50.510
quality and that's what we're seeing

0:02:47.930,0:02:52.190
from cheer and Lin and it's hard to see

0:02:50.510,0:02:52.880
them being displaced from the top two

0:02:52.190,0:02:55.160
positions

0:02:52.880,0:02:58.100
you wouldn't say right from from the off

0:02:55.160,0:02:59.269
that it's a battle for the bronze but I

0:02:58.100,0:03:03.410
think a few people might be thinking

0:02:59.269,0:03:06.200
there yes in diving you cannot afford to

0:03:03.410,0:03:08.570
make one mistake there's no three

0:03:06.200,0:03:11.060
attempts as there is in the high jump or

0:03:08.570,0:03:15.440
the long jump it's one strike and you're

0:03:11.060,0:03:17.090
out really judges being introduced

0:03:15.440,0:03:19.340
they've got the toughest job of the lot

0:03:17.090,0:03:21.829
in here as this standard builds in the

0:03:19.340,0:03:24.140
competition seven of them have to judge

0:03:21.829,0:03:28.130
the execution of each dive which is

0:03:24.140,0:03:31.810
force is pre announced and given a

0:03:28.130,0:03:33.850
specific degree of difficulty or tariff

0:03:31.810,0:03:36.760
you'll be able to follow this quite

0:03:33.850,0:03:40.400
simply when the captions after each

0:03:36.760,0:03:42.300
diver is put on your screen for you the

0:03:40.400,0:03:44.430
top two in the bottom two marks are

0:03:42.300,0:03:46.980
discounted and those three remaining

0:03:44.430,0:03:49.770
marks are then multiplied by that degree

0:03:46.980,0:03:51.690
of difficulty and the basic rule is that

0:03:49.770,0:03:53.580
the higher the degree of difficulty the

0:03:51.690,0:03:55.230
bigger the prize certainly with the

0:03:53.580,0:03:58.620
lower degree certificate ease you've got

0:03:55.230,0:04:00.180
to execute them near perfectly to make

0:03:58.620,0:04:02.310
sure you maintain the sort of points

0:04:00.180,0:04:04.110
tour you'll need to and it's very

0:04:02.310,0:04:05.820
interesting to see Steve as it goes

0:04:04.110,0:04:08.040
through the order they go in a wallet

0:04:05.820,0:04:10.740
two of them coming out playing their big

0:04:08.040,0:04:12.510
dives early on hoping to post a good

0:04:10.740,0:04:15.090
score and one or two others starting a

0:04:12.510,0:04:17.640
bit more conservatively and I just think

0:04:15.090,0:04:19.590
that's a matter of horses for courses he

0:04:17.640,0:04:22.650
if it's to to to put in a tough dive

0:04:19.590,0:04:24.630
early because you feel focused at the

0:04:22.650,0:04:27.300
beginning of competition do it then we

0:04:24.630,0:04:29.040
saw some divers struggle towards the end

0:04:27.300,0:04:31.380
of the preliminaries it was such a long

0:04:29.040,0:04:33.210
session that their legs were weary they

0:04:31.380,0:04:35.070
admitted as much and and three of the

0:04:33.210,0:04:37.380
top six I think had their worst dive as

0:04:35.070,0:04:38.670
their sixth well they've had a good

0:04:37.380,0:04:40.020
break in the middle of the day today

0:04:38.670,0:04:41.490
maybe of talked about the short

0:04:40.020,0:04:43.140
turnaround from last night to this

0:04:41.490,0:04:45.570
morning that they should be well rested

0:04:43.140,0:04:46.890
now and we're expecting them to perform

0:04:45.570,0:04:49.080
at their best and they'll hope to do

0:04:46.890,0:04:51.510
that it was a three hour session last

0:04:49.080,0:04:53.310
night to reduce the numbers from thirty

0:04:51.510,0:04:55.320
to a couple of hours in the pool this

0:04:53.310,0:04:58.590
morning they've had a good rest they

0:04:55.320,0:05:00.300
were finished around about midday so

0:04:58.590,0:05:03.030
I've had a good eight hours or so back

0:05:00.300,0:05:05.520
to the village arrests trying to get the

0:05:03.030,0:05:08.160
mind straight and then back here they've

0:05:05.520,0:05:09.150
been warming up of course and now it is

0:05:08.160,0:05:13.650
for real

0:05:09.150,0:05:17.640
six dives each Riley McCormick from

0:05:13.650,0:05:20.070
Canada will lead us off and for many of

0:05:17.640,0:05:22.530
these divers a place in the final was

0:05:20.070,0:05:24.960
their first aim and now it's all about

0:05:22.530,0:05:26.430
what they can produce on the day Wiley

0:05:24.960,0:05:29.450
opening up with a four with three and a

0:05:26.430,0:05:29.450
half somersault piked

0:05:32.370,0:05:40.210
who solid opening from him at at 72 we

0:05:38.590,0:05:43.509
talked about as being the lowest score

0:05:40.210,0:05:47.199
from the top 12 was his opening dive and

0:05:43.509,0:05:49.979
because it's got a load tariff even

0:05:47.199,0:05:53.699
these eighths can't get him much above

0:05:49.979,0:05:56.620
low to mid-70s

0:05:53.699,0:05:58.930
there we go seventy six point five four

0:05:56.620,0:06:05.169
points he's picked up there from the

0:05:58.930,0:06:07.150
semi-final the same guy right at the top

0:06:05.169,0:06:09.490
of the scale they will be hitting three

0:06:07.150,0:06:12.340
figures with the points total so you're

0:06:09.490,0:06:16.680
really looking to be in the 80s to low

0:06:12.340,0:06:18.069
90s to keep those medal chances going

0:06:16.680,0:06:24.639
next

0:06:18.069,0:06:26.349
Alexander Banda from the Ukraine in with

0:06:24.639,0:06:30.599
three and a half somersault three point

0:06:26.349,0:06:34.590
two tariffs here for the young Ukrainian

0:06:30.599,0:06:34.590
just 18 years of age

0:06:42.680,0:06:51.420
very nice just the smallest hinge at the

0:06:48.360,0:06:56.040
hips seventy eight point four from the

0:06:51.420,0:06:59.130
semi-final for this dive to see how

0:06:56.040,0:07:04.680
vertical he enters the water very close

0:06:59.130,0:07:06.270
to perfect I'm not quite and he will be

0:07:04.680,0:07:10.230
penalized slightly for that were those

0:07:06.270,0:07:13.110
seven and a half coming in and only a 72

0:07:10.230,0:07:15.170
so it's not the start he wanted or

0:07:13.110,0:07:17.460
needed

0:07:15.170,0:07:19.080
bondar said he just wanted to get into

0:07:17.460,0:07:21.500
the final after the swelling's

0:07:19.080,0:07:24.030
performance and he did it but he must

0:07:21.500,0:07:25.650
make sure that it's not just satisfied

0:07:24.030,0:07:28.220
with that it and still continues to

0:07:25.650,0:07:32.600
really show what he can do at this level

0:07:28.220,0:07:35.670
third up is even Garcia from Mexico

0:07:32.600,0:07:38.280
silver medalist in the 10 meters synchro

0:07:35.670,0:07:40.830
already with Chioma Sanchez who missed

0:07:38.280,0:07:43.380
the boat unfortunately for him his

0:07:40.830,0:07:45.240
nickname is polo and I saw someone with

0:07:43.380,0:07:49.080
somehow paint on their backs and vamos

0:07:45.240,0:07:50.790
pollo let's go and go he does forward

0:07:49.080,0:07:58.160
four-and-a-half somersault three point

0:07:50.790,0:07:58.160
seven big opening dive from even Garcia

0:08:02.230,0:08:08.590
just a really difficult dive to control

0:08:05.200,0:08:10.870
the splash a little more than he might

0:08:08.590,0:08:12.910
have liked nice tight tuck position

0:08:10.870,0:08:16.390
spots the water the feet coming over

0:08:12.910,0:08:20.920
just a little about an eighty three

0:08:16.390,0:08:22.450
point two five to start for Navarro my

0:08:20.920,0:08:23.590
missus might miss his countrymen tonight

0:08:22.450,0:08:25.480
because they were chatting in the pool

0:08:23.590,0:08:30.370
afterwards and keeping each other going

0:08:25.480,0:08:33.330
a little bit but Jose Guerra 33 year old

0:08:30.370,0:08:33.330
Cuban diver

0:08:33.390,0:08:39.870
well he's showing again and again that

0:08:36.940,0:08:44.770
age is no barrier we've got a range of

0:08:39.870,0:08:51.190
17 up to 33 and he is the veteran in the

0:08:44.770,0:08:53.200
field and diving beautifully Cuba have

0:08:51.190,0:08:57.540
never won a diving medal he's generally

0:08:53.200,0:08:57.540
regarded as their greatest ever diver

0:08:59.670,0:09:03.720
made a handy start here

0:09:05.020,0:09:09.050
76.5 just a difficulty a little low but

0:09:07.730,0:09:12.770
eight and a half's you don't want less

0:09:09.050,0:09:15.950
than that when the tariff is average two

0:09:12.770,0:09:18.890
Germans in the final 12 this evening

0:09:15.950,0:09:22.100
Sasha Klein diving next is the older

0:09:18.890,0:09:24.890
more experienced of the two at 26 in

0:09:22.100,0:09:33.560
with three and a half somersault 3.2

0:09:24.890,0:09:35.900
tariffs now you were like sashes

0:09:33.560,0:09:38.150
Chancellor's don't you Roger there's an

0:09:35.900,0:09:40.850
outside chance for a middle I think he

0:09:38.150,0:09:43.279
said at the right age he's 26 he's he's

0:09:40.850,0:09:45.860
got eight European goals behind him he's

0:09:43.279,0:09:50.060
mature he's experienced to this level he

0:09:45.860,0:09:52.760
just needs to get it right so as a guide

0:09:50.060,0:09:56.860
seventy six point eight in the semi but

0:09:52.760,0:09:56.860
80 here so he's off and running

0:10:00.299,0:10:07.839
Nick McCrory is up next from the United

0:10:04.809,0:10:10.029
States bronze in the 10 metre synchro

0:10:07.839,0:10:13.029
already in his kit back in with three

0:10:10.029,0:10:17.279
and a half somersault tux position for

0:10:13.029,0:10:17.279
three point two degree of difficulty

0:10:25.210,0:10:33.980
what an entry very quiet into the water

0:10:29.029,0:10:37.010
and the u.s. cheer squad goes up seventy

0:10:33.980,0:10:40.010
six point eight in the semi very close

0:10:37.010,0:10:41.899
to the platform which always gives us a

0:10:40.010,0:10:48.620
nervous moment but he's got some nines

0:10:41.899,0:10:52.790
here McCrory and nines will be the three

0:10:48.620,0:10:56.209
scores that count he is flying out of

0:10:52.790,0:10:58.250
the blocks the Americans have had a good

0:10:56.209,0:11:01.670
competition so far a silver and two

0:10:58.250,0:11:04.399
bronze reviving those glory days when

0:11:01.670,0:11:07.279
they absolutely dominated in the pool at

0:11:04.399,0:11:12.410
86 his ten better than his score in the

0:11:07.279,0:11:14.000
semi Victor mini bio from Russia can he

0:11:12.410,0:11:16.730
match that sort of progress in would

0:11:14.000,0:11:19.209
three and a half somersault tucked three

0:11:16.730,0:11:19.209
point two

0:11:23.380,0:11:34.270
long hold at the top getting his

0:11:25.820,0:11:34.270
composure silence in the pool

0:11:35.890,0:11:41.360
well those legs folded over just a touch

0:11:39.050,0:11:43.330
he collapsed into the somersault under

0:11:41.360,0:11:46.010
the water to try and hold that position

0:11:43.330,0:11:49.490
again he's in tight to the platform

0:11:46.010,0:11:52.610
kicks out now and the legs over just a

0:11:49.490,0:11:56.240
little mini Bob's got a very ambitious

0:11:52.610,0:11:59.090
program with three dives of three six

0:11:56.240,0:12:00.860
and A three seven as well if he gets

0:11:59.090,0:12:03.020
them all he could be in the Middle's but

0:12:00.860,0:12:08.180
I have over stretched himself anyway

0:12:03.020,0:12:11.240
Eddie one six to start perfect match for

0:12:08.180,0:12:14.030
his semi final score now it's Martin

0:12:11.240,0:12:16.850
Wolfram from Germany his first Olympics

0:12:14.030,0:12:18.380
he's just 20 he admitted her to in the

0:12:16.850,0:12:21.610
preliminary competition he didn't do

0:12:18.380,0:12:24.350
that well because he was just so excited

0:12:21.610,0:12:26.030
gotta keep calm now with that arm stand

0:12:24.350,0:12:31.510
back double somersault two and a half

0:12:26.030,0:12:31.510
twists three point six big opening dive

0:12:36.360,0:12:41.470
very nice now this was the top-scoring

0:12:39.370,0:12:46.320
first round dive in the semi-final it

0:12:41.470,0:12:46.320
drew a 91 point eight for Wolfram

0:12:49.680,0:12:53.490
the cheer is not so much for his divers

0:12:51.900,0:12:56.010
for the man coming up next but it should

0:12:53.490,0:12:59.820
be for this dive because he has done

0:12:56.010,0:13:01.950
very well he's closing in on three

0:12:59.820,0:13:06.960
figures with this dive a sneaky look at

0:13:01.950,0:13:10.800
the scoreboard it's a 97 point to worry

0:13:06.960,0:13:13.410
that it's some statement but he's one of

0:13:10.800,0:13:13.890
only three divers to go with a high

0:13:13.410,0:13:16.380
tariff

0:13:13.890,0:13:18.960
first up dive and he's taken the reward

0:13:16.380,0:13:22.160
for the risk Tom Daly has been the

0:13:18.960,0:13:25.080
nation's young poster boy hero since

0:13:22.160,0:13:27.900
Beijing when he was the British team's

0:13:25.080,0:13:29.430
youngest member at 14 years of age back

0:13:27.900,0:13:32.279
two and a half somersault two and a half

0:13:29.430,0:13:38.339
twist three point six of the tariff Tom

0:13:32.279,0:13:41.250
Daly well the crowd wants it to be good

0:13:38.339,0:13:44.580
but he was short he never reached the

0:13:41.250,0:13:46.410
vertical position and the replays are

0:13:44.580,0:13:49.370
going to expose the error here they

0:13:46.410,0:13:54.990
wanted him to start with an emphatic

0:13:49.370,0:13:59.700
dive but there you see he wasn't at the

0:13:54.990,0:14:04.589
vertical nation expects and he almost

0:13:59.700,0:14:07.470
delivers so Tuffy built through his

0:14:04.589,0:14:10.320
program this morning but he cannot

0:14:07.470,0:14:11.900
afford well he can't afford many more

0:14:10.320,0:14:14.010
dives like that that's for certain

0:14:11.900,0:14:22.790
mid-seventies won't get the job done in

0:14:14.010,0:14:22.790
this company so 75 six but five dies now

0:14:23.270,0:14:27.380
some action on the deck here

0:14:27.510,0:14:36.450
a distraction alright we've got the

0:14:34.080,0:14:39.440
conversation coming now I'm wondering if

0:14:36.450,0:14:39.440
Tom Bailey

0:14:42.470,0:14:47.529
we can only guess from here Raja Ben Tom

0:14:45.560,0:14:49.459
Daly got out of the pool looking quite

0:14:47.529,0:14:53.180
concerned that something hadn't gone

0:14:49.459,0:14:55.730
right well there are flashes you see

0:14:53.180,0:14:58.970
people are asked not to have their flash

0:14:55.730,0:15:00.709
on for the cameras they've repeated that

0:14:58.970,0:15:06.290
at every session so far but haven't

0:15:00.709,0:15:07.850
heard it so far this evening now it

0:15:06.290,0:15:10.790
would be some controversy if they let

0:15:07.850,0:15:14.000
him dive again I can't remember that

0:15:10.790,0:15:15.680
happening in certainly hasn't happen in

0:15:14.000,0:15:17.120
these games and only the last couple of

0:15:15.680,0:15:20.889
World Championships I've been to now

0:15:17.120,0:15:20.889
he's come across to explain his point

0:15:31.540,0:15:34.690
[Music]

0:15:37.860,0:15:45.450
I think we've guessed it it's to do with

0:15:42.750,0:15:52.710
the flash photography and and I don't

0:15:45.450,0:15:57.440
think he's got really solid ground for a

0:15:52.710,0:15:57.440
read I've but was an official protest it

0:15:57.470,0:16:01.590
was go up he's going well wonder how the

0:16:00.450,0:16:04.800
rest of our field are gonna react to

0:16:01.590,0:16:05.760
this depending on what he does now I'm

0:16:04.800,0:16:09.960
sure there'll be another announcement

0:16:05.760,0:16:12.800
about the flash photography if that is

0:16:09.960,0:16:12.800
the basis for him

0:16:48.189,0:16:56.709
well that was clear enough and Tom Daly

0:16:52.939,0:16:58.849
has ladies get out of jail card may be

0:16:56.709,0:17:01.689
interesting to know how the rest of the

0:16:58.849,0:17:04.309
competitors react to that whether it's

0:17:01.689,0:17:06.110
sympathy for a fellow pro or they think

0:17:04.309,0:17:11.360
that he's got an unfair advantage it all

0:17:06.110,0:17:15.279
depends how he cashes in so Daly with

0:17:11.360,0:17:18.110
the read I've 75 six was what he got

0:17:15.279,0:17:19.970
first time around now the pressures on

0:17:18.110,0:17:22.459
him to get a better score than that but

0:17:19.970,0:17:24.049
we saw just from one angle that there

0:17:22.459,0:17:28.580
were at least half-a-dozen significant

0:17:24.049,0:17:36.710
flashes the first round of this

0:17:28.580,0:17:41.179
competition Oh much better effort well

0:17:36.710,0:17:47.110
if he is going to be handsomely rewarded

0:17:41.179,0:17:47.110
for putting in the protest Andry diving

0:17:52.300,0:17:56.710
and they pick a point on the ceiling or

0:17:54.610,0:17:59.170
somewhere in the pools to orientate

0:17:56.710,0:18:02.410
themselves around and that presumably is

0:17:59.170,0:18:04.390
at the heart of his his complaint the

0:18:02.410,0:18:05.860
flash catches his eye and he loses his

0:18:04.390,0:18:07.720
bearings in terms of spotting the

0:18:05.860,0:18:13.180
ceiling and it can totally put him off

0:18:07.720,0:18:15.400
well he has more than cashed in on the

0:18:13.180,0:18:21.640
opportunity to read up with a 91 eight

0:18:15.400,0:18:24.790
instead of a seventy five six his pulse

0:18:21.640,0:18:28.060
rate is up sky-high David Boudia had to

0:18:24.790,0:18:32.110
wait his turn twenty three-year-old from

0:18:28.060,0:18:34.000
Texas runs in the ten metre synchro arm

0:18:32.110,0:18:36.720
stand back double somersault two and a

0:18:34.000,0:18:36.720
half twists

0:18:44.950,0:18:49.549
very nice from the dire

0:18:47.149,0:18:52.609
I only just scraped into the semi-finals

0:18:49.549,0:18:54.499
if you weren't with us last night silver

0:18:52.609,0:18:57.229
medalist at World Championships almost

0:18:54.499,0:18:59.929
missed the second at stage of

0:18:57.229,0:19:02.080
competition but then walleston in third

0:18:59.929,0:19:06.289
place behind the two chinese divers and

0:19:02.080,0:19:08.779
he has started impressively very

0:19:06.289,0:19:11.239
impressively silver medalist from the

0:19:08.779,0:19:13.729
World Championships in Shanghai he's

0:19:11.239,0:19:17.239
probably got the the pedigree to justify

0:19:13.729,0:19:18.950
being among the medal contenders just

0:19:17.239,0:19:20.419
another reminder for the crown and I

0:19:18.950,0:19:22.039
can't help but think Roger there would

0:19:20.419,0:19:24.979
be plenty of people here who do not

0:19:22.039,0:19:29.570
speak English and the warning me might

0:19:24.979,0:19:33.559
may mean little to them fair point Lynn

0:19:29.570,0:19:35.929
that you a now the Chinese divers always

0:19:33.559,0:19:38.089
look totally in their own zone so their

0:19:35.929,0:19:40.609
concentration takes some shaking in

0:19:38.089,0:19:43.249
would three and a half somersault tucked

0:19:40.609,0:19:46.239
for the 21 year old the older of the two

0:19:43.249,0:19:46.239
Chinese divers

0:19:49.769,0:19:54.330
beautiful just what we expected

0:19:58.990,0:20:04.250
they know how to start a competition

0:20:01.130,0:20:07.760
they know how to win one and it's with

0:20:04.250,0:20:11.300
this quality he only had 81.6 for his

0:20:07.760,0:20:15.200
first dive in the semies but with the

0:20:11.300,0:20:17.060
nines and nine and a half's here it's

0:20:15.200,0:20:18.950
gonna be a very well three nine and a

0:20:17.060,0:20:23.090
half so what's gonna count we reject

0:20:18.950,0:20:27.500
that low nine rate start from him ninety

0:20:23.090,0:20:29.300
one two interestingly Lin this morning

0:20:27.500,0:20:30.560
after competition said he was desperate

0:20:29.300,0:20:33.050
for gold and really going to be trying

0:20:30.560,0:20:35.570
his best and Cubo said the Middle's not

0:20:33.050,0:20:37.970
so important I just want to do my best

0:20:35.570,0:20:40.760
mind you he knows that his best is the

0:20:37.970,0:20:44.450
best hue both a favorite in would three

0:20:40.760,0:20:51.860
and a half somersault three point to his

0:20:44.450,0:20:54.740
opening dive well there it is the

0:20:51.860,0:20:57.470
quality that we saw from Lin replicated

0:20:54.740,0:20:59.380
by chuubo don't expect him to be leading

0:20:57.470,0:21:03.350
after the first round because it's a

0:20:59.380,0:21:08.270
just a three point two tariff that he's

0:21:03.350,0:21:10.910
making the most of it oh the anyway you

0:21:08.270,0:21:13.990
attend just to whet your appetite for

0:21:10.910,0:21:13.990
what's ahead from this man

0:21:18.290,0:21:22.340
we keep coming back to that word

0:21:19.730,0:21:25.640
consistency but they they never seem to

0:21:22.340,0:21:28.520
let their standards slip and a ninety

0:21:25.640,0:21:30.590
one point two picked up a couple of more

0:21:28.520,0:21:34.850
points from his semi final effort with

0:21:30.590,0:21:37.040
that first dive so China very solid star

0:21:34.850,0:21:42.920
in fact though identical scores for Chu

0:21:37.040,0:21:44.150
Lin 91 - well there's the standings

0:21:42.920,0:21:47.770
after the first round

0:21:44.150,0:21:53.500
David budaya Marcin wolfram Tom Daly

0:21:47.770,0:21:57.830
then you a then Cuba Venrock Rory

0:21:53.500,0:21:59.710
there's yet another reminder from the

0:21:57.830,0:22:02.780
announcers about the flash photography

0:21:59.710,0:22:05.150
but again in this first round it's the

0:22:02.780,0:22:08.420
degree of difficulty which is the

0:22:05.150,0:22:11.120
deciding factor depending on which

0:22:08.420,0:22:14.620
tariffs dive these competitors open up

0:22:11.120,0:22:21.850
with we're all even itself out of course

0:22:14.620,0:22:24.290
second round of six while in McCormick

0:22:21.850,0:22:29.360
back two and a half somersault two and a

0:22:24.290,0:22:33.940
half twists three point six the tariff

0:22:29.360,0:22:33.940
for the TWiT year old Canadian

0:22:43.940,0:22:48.360
those leaks just folding over a little

0:22:46.290,0:22:50.790
on entry he made a rip-roaring start

0:22:48.360,0:22:54.690
with a fairly straight forward opening

0:22:50.790,0:22:57.600
dive to be in sixth position 86.4 member

0:22:54.690,0:23:00.419
he was the last qualifier into the final

0:22:57.600,0:23:04.470
but the feet just a little loss of leg

0:23:00.419,0:23:07.760
form there and then over rotating so not

0:23:04.470,0:23:10.140
a match in execution for his first dive

0:23:07.760,0:23:13.860
didn't make the final in Beijing he was

0:23:10.140,0:23:16.140
16th so this is progress for him in his

0:23:13.860,0:23:21.059
second Olympics all about the scores

0:23:16.140,0:23:23.809
though maybe six for steady eights

0:23:21.059,0:23:23.809
through the middle there

0:23:25.130,0:23:32.040
Alexander Banda from Ukraine forward

0:23:30.059,0:23:36.840
four and a half somersault three points

0:23:32.040,0:23:40.530
seven Terrace well well done control the

0:23:36.840,0:23:43.260
entry minimize the splash it wasn't

0:23:40.530,0:23:45.780
particularly convincing with the angle

0:23:43.260,0:23:47.880
of entry only just straightening out in

0:23:45.780,0:23:53.940
time but the judges will like that

0:23:47.880,0:23:56.280
impression of no splash it was a thinly

0:23:53.940,0:23:58.549
ten metre synchro competition with

0:23:56.280,0:24:00.960
Alexander Gorshkov us off

0:23:58.549,0:24:06.380
that's his highest Terrace dive as well

0:24:00.960,0:24:06.380
isn't it and an eighty eight point eight

0:24:06.659,0:24:15.489
make up a little bit of ground after his

0:24:09.639,0:24:19.269
first dive of 72 he van Garcia from

0:24:15.489,0:24:21.720
Mexico next to dive back three and a

0:24:19.269,0:24:25.659
half somersault three point three

0:24:21.720,0:24:37.200
tariffs here it's his first Olympic

0:24:25.659,0:24:40.210
Games just 18 years of age and away oh

0:24:37.200,0:24:42.989
he did a great job there very impressive

0:24:40.210,0:24:45.220
height off the platform really drove up

0:24:42.989,0:24:48.999
give himself time to get through the

0:24:45.220,0:24:56.259
somersaults and make it for an easy

0:24:48.999,0:25:00.279
entry I like this very tight tuck

0:24:56.259,0:25:03.070
position very good angle into the water

0:25:00.279,0:25:05.889
and not much of a splash there soon top

0:25:03.070,0:25:08.710
job he's one of the divers who came to

0:25:05.889,0:25:11.440
the World Cup event here in the Aquatic

0:25:08.710,0:25:15.309
Centre in February and was second in the

0:25:11.440,0:25:25.769
10 meters so well researched for his

0:25:15.309,0:25:29.940
trip Jose grown up from Cuba 33 year old

0:25:25.769,0:25:29.940
back through in a half somersault

0:25:32.350,0:25:39.440
just you see these more experienced

0:25:36.680,0:25:41.270
divers may not achieve that perfect

0:25:39.440,0:25:43.490
vertical position and yet they can still

0:25:41.270,0:25:46.880
find a way to minimize the splash and

0:25:43.490,0:25:48.050
here's a prime example of it you see he

0:25:46.880,0:25:50.600
was coming in at a little bit of an

0:25:48.050,0:25:54.170
angle didn't throw up too much water but

0:25:50.600,0:25:57.320
the judges will still have noticed that

0:25:54.170,0:26:01.250
he was not quite vertical it's his

0:25:57.320,0:26:03.560
fourth Olympic Games and he was a fifth

0:26:01.250,0:26:10.090
in Beijing so he's been making steady

0:26:03.560,0:26:10.090
progress in 88 - well done to the Cuban

0:26:10.600,0:26:16.310
now Sasha Klein from Germany not his

0:26:14.510,0:26:27.650
best opening dye forward for a half

0:26:16.310,0:26:30.140
somersault with that 3.7 taraf here well

0:26:27.650,0:26:32.930
by contrast with the previous dive he

0:26:30.140,0:26:35.480
had a good angle but but more splash now

0:26:32.930,0:26:38.660
with this dive in the semi scored a 90

0:26:35.480,0:26:41.420
point six five the splash might just be

0:26:38.660,0:26:46.940
a handbrake on his score here seven and

0:26:41.420,0:26:51.010
a half's coming in bronze medal in last

0:26:46.940,0:26:51.010
year's World Championships in Shanghai

0:26:58.870,0:27:06.250
so in 83 to five possessions second dive

0:27:03.430,0:27:10.840
it's given back a few points on the

0:27:06.250,0:27:13.240
semi-final score Nick McCrory in sixth

0:27:10.840,0:27:15.130
position after his opening dive this one

0:27:13.240,0:27:20.950
is an arm stand back double somersault

0:27:15.130,0:27:28.120
with one and a half twists 3.2 is the

0:27:20.950,0:27:30.480
tariff on how long the hold would be at

0:27:28.120,0:27:30.480
the top

0:27:35.730,0:27:45.690
it's a long hold and hear the gasp of

0:27:43.410,0:27:48.240
air the effort as he pushes away from

0:27:45.690,0:27:49.770
the platform when armed stands got to be

0:27:48.240,0:27:51.780
held long enough and steady enough to

0:27:49.770,0:27:59.670
convince the judges that you're

0:27:51.780,0:28:01.230
comfortable there and in control our

0:27:59.670,0:28:04.340
American has won this 10 metre platform

0:28:01.230,0:28:08.940
event since the great Greg Louganis in

0:28:04.340,0:28:15.540
88 in Seoul he's here in London with the

0:28:08.940,0:28:17.550
various media duties another great

0:28:15.540,0:28:19.860
school there for Macquarie he been after

0:28:17.550,0:28:22.080
more than 75 - but 7 and a half and 8

0:28:19.860,0:28:24.780
doesn't quite cut it in this company

0:28:22.080,0:28:27.650
Victor media buyer from Russia with a

0:28:24.780,0:28:31.940
forward four and a half somersault 3.7

0:28:27.650,0:28:35.870
already seen a few of these dives

0:28:31.940,0:28:35.870
completed or attempted

0:28:37.970,0:28:44.100
well that's one of the better ones and

0:28:42.540,0:28:46.350
when you're going for a three point

0:28:44.100,0:28:50.760
seven tariff it's a real opportunity to

0:28:46.350,0:28:52.950
move up the board and eighty six nine

0:28:50.760,0:28:59.250
five for this one in the semi for mini

0:28:52.950,0:29:02.910
buy of so much rotation there's so much

0:28:59.250,0:29:04.950
a spin speed a build build up hit the

0:29:02.910,0:29:06.960
water just over thirty people have tried

0:29:04.950,0:29:08.730
to calculate that it's knocking on

0:29:06.960,0:29:10.590
towards 60 mile an hour they're spinning

0:29:08.730,0:29:13.260
out but they take a bit of grasping

0:29:10.590,0:29:16.710
those figures ninety-two five these he's

0:29:13.260,0:29:18.180
picked up a few points by comparison

0:29:16.710,0:29:19.770
with these semi score net that's what

0:29:18.180,0:29:22.980
they'll be aiming to do just improve a

0:29:19.770,0:29:26.070
few points every dive not involved from

0:29:22.980,0:29:27.660
from Germany terrific opening dive in

0:29:26.070,0:29:33.120
with three and a half somersault just

0:29:27.660,0:29:35.340
the three point two tariffs here oh he's

0:29:33.120,0:29:37.770
done a beautiful job well while from

0:29:35.340,0:29:44.040
looks the man in early form with his

0:29:37.770,0:29:46.880
first two dives ninety seven to for his

0:29:44.040,0:29:46.880
first remember

0:29:47.580,0:29:51.690
he's obviously made terrific progress in

0:29:49.710,0:29:54.090
the last 12 months sir he didn't get

0:29:51.690,0:29:55.950
through qualification at the World

0:29:54.090,0:30:01.230
Championships last year his first big

0:29:55.950,0:30:04.259
event but he is flying now 86 for as he

0:30:01.230,0:30:07.700
had in the semi so wolfram making a

0:30:04.259,0:30:07.700
statement with his first two dives

0:30:10.999,0:30:15.029
demobilized the flash beef right to take

0:30:13.950,0:30:17.970
a photograph wouldn't he

0:30:15.029,0:30:19.619
Tom Daly after that dramatic read I've

0:30:17.970,0:30:30.529
now with an inward three and a half

0:30:19.619,0:30:30.529
somersault again a great dive

0:30:33.010,0:30:38.440
we won the national under-18 title when

0:30:35.410,0:30:46.840
he was only 10 and he's been a marked

0:30:38.440,0:30:51.850
man or boy ever since and it's nine-foot

0:30:46.840,0:30:53.830
for daily a 91 8 first dive and if

0:30:51.850,0:30:55.690
you're just joining us he got to retake

0:30:53.830,0:30:58.540
that first dive after a protest because

0:30:55.690,0:31:00.730
of flash photography in the room and he

0:30:58.540,0:31:04.750
picked up 15 points on his first effort

0:31:00.730,0:31:07.480
and an 86 for here he's on his way to

0:31:04.750,0:31:12.370
something maybe David Beckham's come to

0:31:07.480,0:31:14.559
watch him then no more lines about

0:31:12.370,0:31:15.880
diving and from football working

0:31:14.559,0:31:18.190
certainly not with Beck's

0:31:15.880,0:31:21.880
no that never happened David booty I

0:31:18.190,0:31:24.850
know the American in with three and a

0:31:21.880,0:31:29.940
half somersault again a really strong

0:31:24.850,0:31:29.940
opening dive three point two the tariff

0:31:30.690,0:31:36.549
[Applause]

0:31:33.390,0:31:38.410
Obadiah he was another to make a comment

0:31:36.549,0:31:40.120
about that short turnaround from prelims

0:31:38.410,0:31:43.630
to semi sit he only got six hours sleep

0:31:40.120,0:31:46.049
perform very well nonetheless as he is

0:31:43.630,0:31:50.860
doing in this final that's a a

0:31:46.049,0:31:52.419
spectacular second die from the dire he

0:31:50.860,0:31:54.940
was asked about nerves at this level of

0:31:52.419,0:31:56.620
competition and said if you ask all 12

0:31:54.940,0:31:59.370
divers whether they get nervous a

0:31:56.620,0:32:02.140
hundred percent will say yes

0:31:59.370,0:32:04.990
why wouldn't you it's not just a

0:32:02.140,0:32:08.160
competition it's what they're doing 10

0:32:04.990,0:32:14.470
meters up do put themselves in danger

0:32:08.160,0:32:18.309
each time then you a from China the 2008

0:32:14.470,0:32:22.260
Olympics synchro champion another

0:32:18.309,0:32:22.260
exquisite dive from Lin you a

0:32:22.369,0:32:26.779
ninety one point two threes first

0:32:28.399,0:32:34.249
starting to rack up the nines and nine

0:32:30.809,0:32:34.249
and a half's consistently now

0:32:39.460,0:32:46.779
so in control and the judges in absolute

0:32:43.239,0:32:49.950
unison with their assessment of 9.5 for

0:32:46.779,0:32:52.659
linear and a 90 405

0:32:49.950,0:32:55.539
he's the synchro specialist this is a

0:32:52.659,0:33:00.009
rare individual opportunity for Lin

0:32:55.539,0:33:03.519
unlike Chabot there's been the solostar

0:33:00.009,0:33:07.539
the 19 year old son of a factory worker

0:33:03.519,0:33:11.729
in Sichuan Province armed stand back

0:33:07.539,0:33:11.729
triple somersault three point five

0:33:13.889,0:33:21.999
perfect armed stand well that was

0:33:21.519,0:33:24.309
beautiful

0:33:21.999,0:33:26.559
this was a guy that he had a little bit

0:33:24.309,0:33:29.320
of a struggle with in the semi-final was

0:33:26.559,0:33:31.119
only the 13th ranked dive he made a

0:33:29.320,0:33:33.099
mistake and we were shocked to see it

0:33:31.119,0:33:35.710
because we're so used to perfection or

0:33:33.099,0:33:38.649
near to it from him but he has picked up

0:33:35.710,0:33:41.369
his game here with his second attempt at

0:33:38.649,0:33:41.369
it today

0:33:44.540,0:33:48.680
this competition is really going to be

0:33:47.250,0:33:52.290
tough

0:33:48.680,0:33:55.620
frightening ly impressive at the top and

0:33:52.290,0:33:57.690
the competition just below that 94.5 and

0:33:55.620,0:33:59.760
there he is he's moved to normal

0:33:57.690,0:34:04.170
transmission less risky and Roger is

0:33:59.760,0:34:09.060
number one both looks so calm during

0:34:04.170,0:34:12.030
competition the status quo chuubo Lin

0:34:09.060,0:34:16.909
you a David bouton Martin Wolfram having

0:34:12.030,0:34:16.909
a great first Olympics Tom Daley and

0:34:20.720,0:34:29.190
through to Alexander bond are bringing

0:34:25.500,0:34:31.230
out the rear at the moment but he's 12

0:34:29.190,0:34:33.450
out of 32 let's put it that way let's

0:34:31.230,0:34:36.659
give them the credit for reaching

0:34:33.450,0:34:39.060
through to this stage which for many of

0:34:36.659,0:34:41.640
them was their ambition to reach an

0:34:39.060,0:34:44.159
Olympic final such a fantastic occasion

0:34:41.640,0:34:47.190
and they will all feel privileged to be

0:34:44.159,0:34:49.790
diving alongside during competition to

0:34:47.190,0:34:54.810
the very best around

0:34:49.790,0:34:57.510
Riley McCormick can never won attend me

0:34:54.810,0:35:01.710
to medal we've had nine diving medals in

0:34:57.510,0:35:08.430
all he's coming in with three and a half

0:35:01.710,0:35:19.710
somersault to perform now this customary

0:35:08.430,0:35:21.270
little flicks into the opposition Court

0:35:19.710,0:35:24.480
or in this case into the water and he's

0:35:21.270,0:35:26.340
done a nice job there there's McCormick

0:35:24.480,0:35:30.690
they must have a trigger something that

0:35:26.340,0:35:32.790
say now is the moment a lot of if it

0:35:30.690,0:35:34.880
goes through those toes to get some

0:35:32.790,0:35:39.090
elevation

0:35:34.880,0:35:41.700
through the somersaults nice job here

0:35:39.090,0:35:43.400
good tight tuck excellent position into

0:35:41.700,0:35:51.000
the water

0:35:43.400,0:35:52.470
maybe one six steady I think most of us

0:35:51.000,0:35:53.820
would need a trigger to get up there and

0:35:52.470,0:35:56.220
the gun to go with it to jump off that

0:35:53.820,0:35:58.680
Timmy debord like they do should never

0:35:56.220,0:36:00.360
forget the sheer bravery of it while

0:35:58.680,0:36:03.570
we're admiring all the skill and all the

0:36:00.360,0:36:06.810
technique takes some nerve

0:36:03.570,0:36:08.490
now it's Alexander bond our arms stand

0:36:06.810,0:36:13.700
back double somersault two and a half

0:36:08.490,0:36:13.700
twist three point six tariffs here

0:36:23.400,0:36:29.140
very tidy on the entry now Banda is

0:36:26.440,0:36:31.420
about 25 points behind the leader so

0:36:29.140,0:36:35.680
he's to make a move it needs to come now

0:36:31.420,0:36:37.720
with dive number three pushing up and

0:36:35.680,0:36:43.510
out away from the platform

0:36:37.720,0:36:45.490
feet apart though I have to say probably

0:36:43.510,0:36:47.650
that the entry was the best part of the

0:36:45.490,0:36:53.490
dive but his leg form a little loose

0:36:47.650,0:36:53.490
ankles not together except for the end

0:36:54.650,0:37:02.670
maybe 2.84 bandha again we must point

0:36:59.460,0:37:05.550
out that we are privileged we see the

0:37:02.670,0:37:07.920
replays of the dives the judges of

0:37:05.550,0:37:12.990
course have just one shot at it to make

0:37:07.920,0:37:15.690
their judgment call or in Tom Daley's

0:37:12.990,0:37:17.790
case two shots at it this time hmm

0:37:15.690,0:37:20.910
that will be talked about especially if

0:37:17.790,0:37:26.340
he gets himself on the podium even

0:37:20.910,0:37:29.310
Garcia of Mexico have a 18 year old with

0:37:26.340,0:37:31.619
an inward four and a half somersault it

0:37:29.310,0:37:43.710
would dives frightening ly close to the

0:37:31.619,0:37:52.710
platform he's done a good job with it

0:37:43.710,0:37:54.440
too Mexican fans are happy he's got what

0:37:52.710,0:37:56.640
can only be described as a pretty gutsy

0:37:54.440,0:38:02.720
sheduled for himself as neat high

0:37:56.640,0:38:02.720
tariffs brave dives gambler

0:38:04.330,0:38:07.930
so the aches are gonna count the to

0:38:06.280,0:38:11.500
seven and a half will be rejected the

0:38:07.930,0:38:15.310
feet just drifting away from the ideal

0:38:11.500,0:38:16.990
line a ninety eight point four and

0:38:15.310,0:38:21.460
that's because of that four point one

0:38:16.990,0:38:25.660
tariff for tune favoring the brave there

0:38:21.460,0:38:31.960
with Yvonne Garcia the Barry brave Jose

0:38:25.660,0:38:34.060
get up from Cuba fifth in the ten metre

0:38:31.960,0:38:38.520
synchro event now with an inward three

0:38:34.060,0:38:38.520
and a half somersault 3.20

0:38:41.200,0:38:46.030
that's just something of a hold and

0:38:43.870,0:38:50.080
remember that was as good as it can be

0:38:46.030,0:38:52.750
done it's a low tariff so something in

0:38:50.080,0:38:55.110
the mid eighties is is a very good

0:38:52.750,0:38:55.110
reward

0:38:57.060,0:39:06.610
alright nines are gonna count that's

0:39:02.830,0:39:08.320
what he needs to get into that 86 for

0:39:06.610,0:39:12.120
that's exactly what he had in the semi

0:39:08.320,0:39:16.350
because here the dive equally well there

0:39:12.120,0:39:16.350
he's got that one under control

0:39:16.830,0:39:26.590
Sasha Klein from Germany serves in the

0:39:22.720,0:39:29.380
army eight European titles twice he's

0:39:26.590,0:39:32.140
been European champion at ten meters but

0:39:29.380,0:39:34.960
European Championship two Olympic Games

0:39:32.140,0:39:37.530
is some step up arm stand back triple

0:39:34.960,0:39:37.530
somersault

0:39:38.630,0:39:46.279
or in the pike position the legs just

0:39:42.499,0:39:47.809
flipped right over and you don't want to

0:39:46.279,0:39:49.089
look at the the scores but they're going

0:39:47.809,0:39:56.239
to hear them

0:39:49.089,0:40:02.930
this went rather wrong just straightened

0:39:56.239,0:40:06.769
up too early and over it went so the

0:40:02.930,0:40:09.829
sixes they're gonna hurt the 6065 and

0:40:06.769,0:40:13.309
Sasha Cline bit of a smoky for a medal

0:40:09.829,0:40:15.440
but maybe not now it was probably better

0:40:13.309,0:40:18.440
earlier in the competition he was really

0:40:15.440,0:40:25.369
been able to do it on the big stage Nick

0:40:18.440,0:40:29.569
McCrory now from the United States 21

0:40:25.369,0:40:34.160
years of age from North Carolina forward

0:40:29.569,0:40:36.470
four and a half somersault tucked

0:40:34.160,0:40:39.289
position three point seven the tariff

0:40:36.470,0:40:42.229
here such a hard dive to control at the

0:40:39.289,0:40:44.809
end to achieve something like a vertical

0:40:42.229,0:40:46.900
position and minimize the splash no

0:40:44.809,0:40:53.799
one's really been able to nail this one

0:40:46.900,0:40:53.799
high tariffs three seven big splash

0:40:54.249,0:40:59.859
count them if you can one two three four

0:40:56.900,0:40:59.859
and a half

0:41:01.470,0:41:07.530
it wasn't a half he'd go in feet-first

0:41:03.630,0:41:10.710
and they just don't do that not

0:41:07.530,0:41:12.420
intentionally anyway unfortunately we've

0:41:10.710,0:41:17.310
not seen a disaster in this competition

0:41:12.420,0:41:20.370
we've had one or two ones go terribly

0:41:17.310,0:41:22.620
wrong but not a an incomplete dive which

0:41:20.370,0:41:25.520
scores zero was one in the three meter

0:41:22.620,0:41:27.990
competition wish that on anyone

0:41:25.520,0:41:32.090
victim Adeeb I've reversed three and a

0:41:27.990,0:41:35.750
half somersault for the Russian diver

0:41:32.090,0:41:35.750
first Olympic Games

0:41:36.320,0:41:43.710
excellent work from Viktor the

0:41:40.590,0:41:47.490
unmistakable Russian uniform worn by

0:41:43.710,0:41:54.270
competitors and supporters alike really

0:41:47.490,0:41:56.430
lets you know from that group he was

0:41:54.270,0:42:00.960
fourth in the world championships last

0:41:56.430,0:42:04.080
year so again he brings good credibility

0:42:00.960,0:42:07.550
into the competition he hit that

0:42:04.080,0:42:07.550
vertical position very early

0:42:07.589,0:42:12.059
now himself to straighten out and

0:42:09.390,0:42:13.739
collect an 89.1 he's picked up ten

0:42:12.059,0:42:16.949
points on his semi school for the same

0:42:13.739,0:42:18.930
dive well done victim and above the last

0:42:16.949,0:42:22.049
German to win a medal at ten meters was

0:42:18.930,0:42:24.150
yen hempel a silver in the Lanter in 96

0:42:22.049,0:42:26.130
but Martin Wolfram has really put

0:42:24.150,0:42:30.859
himself in with a chance here in Reverse

0:42:26.130,0:42:30.859
three and a half somersault his third

0:42:30.949,0:42:36.599
well there we go the first little sign

0:42:34.410,0:42:40.799
of pressure and a minor mistake from

0:42:36.599,0:42:42.779
Martin liked have had this one back to

0:42:40.799,0:42:48.539
have another crack at the entry which

0:42:42.779,0:42:50.640
was a little untidy not that it was a

0:42:48.539,0:42:54.569
bad position he just didn't to control

0:42:50.640,0:42:56.999
the splash as he went beneath he's a

0:42:54.569,0:43:00.439
little after pulling the ear down with

0:42:56.999,0:43:09.119
you separating the arms dragging it down

0:43:00.439,0:43:14.729
and a 7075 five for Martin Tom Daley up

0:43:09.119,0:43:19.920
next British national senior champion at

0:43:14.729,0:43:23.279
13 years youngest ever European gold

0:43:19.920,0:43:27.509
medalist back in 2008 arm stand back

0:43:23.279,0:43:30.019
triple somersault three point five is in

0:43:27.509,0:43:30.019
fifth place

0:43:36.230,0:43:42.630
Nexen a guy from Tom Donnelly wouldn't

0:43:41.190,0:43:44.790
matter what he did you get a big role

0:43:42.630,0:43:47.660
for him from this crowd but that was

0:43:44.790,0:43:47.660
worth cheering

0:43:53.160,0:43:57.510
great position on MG he's just an

0:43:55.950,0:44:01.950
impression from time to time that he's

0:43:57.510,0:44:03.750
not quite square on entry not not the

0:44:01.950,0:44:09.930
line of the vertical but square with the

0:44:03.750,0:44:12.150
side of the pool and there's a just a

0:44:09.930,0:44:14.880
hint of a twist there but unless the

0:44:12.150,0:44:18.300
judges spot it like we do on the slo-mo

0:44:14.880,0:44:22.080
it's not gonna get too penalized in a 92

0:44:18.300,0:44:24.180
75 that's 8 marks better than from the

0:44:22.080,0:44:25.350
semi we have three great dives with

0:44:24.180,0:44:36.510
Peter Waterfield and a synchro

0:44:25.350,0:44:39.620
competition talked and it brought a

0:44:36.510,0:44:42.210
massive cheer from the American camp

0:44:39.620,0:44:44.580
standby this could be close to 100 he

0:44:42.210,0:44:47.760
got ninety four point three five with it

0:44:44.580,0:44:53.640
in the semis and this was the four and a

0:44:47.760,0:44:55.920
half done beautifully he just scraped

0:44:53.640,0:44:57.720
into the semi-final Italy we nearly

0:44:55.920,0:45:07.380
didn't have him in this competition and

0:44:57.720,0:45:16.920
he is really scoring ninety-nine point

0:45:07.380,0:45:19.530
nine that's cruel business liken up for

0:45:16.920,0:45:21.780
it in his manner Lin you a far more

0:45:19.530,0:45:25.010
composed and restrained back three and a

0:45:21.780,0:45:27.690
half somersault even the silver position

0:45:25.010,0:45:30.180
he loves this dive he got a hundred and

0:45:27.690,0:45:33.000
two for it in the semis but not with

0:45:30.180,0:45:37.140
that level of splash though so it might

0:45:33.000,0:45:39.770
just hold him back a little great drive

0:45:37.140,0:45:43.200
off the platform up and into his word

0:45:39.770,0:45:46.920
fantastic position and he's not going to

0:45:43.200,0:45:48.530
score 100 this time best individual

0:45:46.920,0:45:51.570
performance ever was a bronze at the

0:45:48.530,0:45:54.360
2007 World Championships since then he's

0:45:51.570,0:45:57.210
really had a chance to dive individually

0:45:54.360,0:46:00.630
always in the synchro votes where he's

0:45:57.210,0:46:03.490
Donna an Olympic gold almost peerless

0:46:00.630,0:46:06.470
through the year ninety one point eight

0:46:03.490,0:46:09.080
not in the 90s his little 11 points go

0:46:06.470,0:46:13.910
from his semi score and see what all

0:46:09.080,0:46:18.700
this means soon enough Q boat reverse

0:46:13.910,0:46:21.080
three and a half somersault the leader

0:46:18.700,0:46:23.450
approaching the halfway stage this his

0:46:21.080,0:46:28.130
third dive three point three the tariff

0:46:23.450,0:46:30.140
oh my goodness what a dive how close was

0:46:28.130,0:46:32.030
he did a platform we'll get another look

0:46:30.140,0:46:34.670
at it to it just increase your heart

0:46:32.030,0:46:38.570
rate a little but ninety four oh five in

0:46:34.670,0:46:40.520
the semi his tariff for his first three

0:46:38.570,0:46:45.650
dives are only three two three five and

0:46:40.520,0:46:49.700
thirty three and yet he's going to be at

0:46:45.650,0:46:52.000
the top or near and his hard dives are

0:46:49.700,0:46:52.000
yet to come

0:46:55.390,0:47:00.130
and he's in second spot where those two

0:46:58.329,0:47:01.779
tens are that stuff they get ruled out

0:47:00.130,0:47:04.029
as the two top scorers along with the

0:47:01.779,0:47:06.430
two bottom the tens don't count

0:47:04.029,0:47:08.740
now he's just been displaced from the

0:47:06.430,0:47:11.380
top following that wonderful ninety nine

0:47:08.740,0:47:13.630
point nine from the Daiya here it's

0:47:11.380,0:47:16.680
David Boudia who's leading at the moment

0:47:13.630,0:47:19.869
he's really responding to this challenge

0:47:16.680,0:47:24.190
Chabot and Lynn you a second and third

0:47:19.869,0:47:27.640
Tom Daley forth and even Garcia coming

0:47:24.190,0:47:30.670
up to fifth Martin Wolfram just dropping

0:47:27.640,0:47:32.279
back a little after some very impressive

0:47:30.670,0:47:35.950
work

0:47:32.279,0:47:38.799
Sasha Klein really starting to fade away

0:47:35.950,0:47:41.019
at any bits I think a good thing has

0:47:38.799,0:47:43.119
happened here Roger such hot favorites

0:47:41.019,0:47:45.069
with chuubo and Lynn UA for someone to

0:47:43.119,0:47:47.019
put some pressure on and actually be

0:47:45.069,0:47:48.880
leading them at the halfway point could

0:47:47.019,0:47:50.019
bring out yet another level from them

0:47:48.880,0:47:55.000
out I think we've got a great

0:47:50.019,0:47:56.650
competition on our hands now well plenty

0:47:55.000,0:47:59.109
of tithers have been in position that to

0:47:56.650,0:48:01.509
win the gold in Olympic Games or world

0:47:59.109,0:48:04.779
championships they've had to produce a

0:48:01.509,0:48:06.339
series of tens we've got a couple in

0:48:04.779,0:48:09.250
that previous round but we've not been

0:48:06.339,0:48:12.039
absolutely dazzled by a score brilliant

0:48:09.250,0:48:14.680
yes but it's still another level where

0:48:12.039,0:48:16.480
you feel that maybe they can go Marley

0:48:14.680,0:48:21.279
McCormick arm stand back triple

0:48:16.480,0:48:23.380
somersault you know marks for how you

0:48:21.279,0:48:26.319
get to the arm stand just as long as you

0:48:23.380,0:48:31.480
hold it steadily and in good shape so he

0:48:26.319,0:48:33.670
likes that split move to the arm stand

0:48:31.480,0:48:36.940
fines the water comes in fairly

0:48:33.670,0:48:40.260
vertically and gets a nice return the

0:48:36.940,0:48:40.260
tows giving us a wave

0:48:41.070,0:48:44.920
the directors done well to spot that

0:48:43.330,0:48:49.690
hasn't he is a feature to look for in

0:48:44.920,0:48:54.340
the apps and the camera just 16 when he

0:48:49.690,0:48:58.920
competed in Beijing finished 16th in the

0:48:54.340,0:49:01.960
10 meters but progress this time out

0:48:58.920,0:49:05.890
Alexander Bondar from Ukraine

0:49:01.960,0:49:09.210
back in 11th position for the 18 year

0:49:05.890,0:49:09.210
old from Lugansk

0:49:16.439,0:49:23.880
this is one of his better dives in 89

0:49:19.029,0:49:28.209
won in the semi from Banda is just

0:49:23.880,0:49:30.099
failing a little to impress he he's not

0:49:28.209,0:49:33.839
gonna be a top five finish it here on

0:49:30.099,0:49:33.839
fields on the evidence of his first fall

0:49:34.199,0:49:39.789
he was still competing at junior level

0:49:36.969,0:49:42.779
last year gold medalist in the European

0:49:39.789,0:49:45.759
Junior Championships 10 metre platform

0:49:42.779,0:49:48.029
this is with the big boys now though

0:49:45.759,0:49:48.029
isn't it

0:49:48.209,0:49:59.349
seventy nine point two Banda Devan

0:49:55.150,0:50:01.900
Garcia of Mexico two silvers and a

0:49:59.349,0:50:03.849
bronze so far for the Mexicans in the

0:50:01.900,0:50:08.019
diving pool he's got one of those

0:50:03.849,0:50:10.959
Silver's in the 10 metre synchro fifth

0:50:08.019,0:50:12.189
he's in the frame if you're interested

0:50:10.959,0:50:13.779
in such things a lot of the camera

0:50:12.189,0:50:15.999
angles that were showing you are from

0:50:13.779,0:50:27.429
cameras that are unmanned if you like

0:50:15.999,0:50:30.489
they're on cranes and tracks double

0:50:27.429,0:50:38.169
somersault two and a half twists and

0:50:30.489,0:50:41.529
this is all human technology yes a

0:50:38.169,0:50:46.509
little less than ideal at the at the

0:50:41.529,0:50:48.400
entry kicks it out well looks to be

0:50:46.509,0:50:50.949
getting through it okay nice form with

0:50:48.400,0:50:53.579
the legs and then over she goes and that

0:50:50.949,0:50:57.099
was quite a serious mistake on entry

0:50:53.579,0:51:00.509
you'll pay for that all very very good

0:50:57.099,0:51:00.509
until the last gasp

0:51:01.610,0:51:08.720
and at 81 the judge is recognizing that

0:51:06.080,0:51:13.970
until you hit the water it was all done

0:51:08.720,0:51:16.220
very tidally cosy Guerra

0:51:13.970,0:51:20.060
who was Cuba's first ever world

0:51:16.220,0:51:23.330
championship medalist back in 2005 in

0:51:20.060,0:51:24.890
the synchro with younger a Guerra who

0:51:23.330,0:51:28.420
didn't make the cut

0:51:24.890,0:51:31.460
arm stand reverse triple somersault now

0:51:28.420,0:51:35.900
tucked position three point four the

0:51:31.460,0:51:46.370
tariff slightly hesitant arm stand he's

0:51:35.900,0:51:49.480
up there now great job and three point

0:51:46.370,0:51:49.480
for the tariff

0:51:51.370,0:51:58.420
something in the mid to high 80s might

0:51:54.190,0:52:06.550
just moving up a spot or two well the

0:51:58.420,0:52:08.920
judges do like this nine and a half may

0:52:06.550,0:52:11.530
well be his last senior competition

0:52:08.920,0:52:13.870
perhaps at 33 still has to get the

0:52:11.530,0:52:16.090
motivation and the training but plenty

0:52:13.870,0:52:19.450
of life in the old dog yet no that's a

0:52:16.090,0:52:24.870
juicy score 96.9 better than anything he

0:52:19.450,0:52:28.240
got in the semi final loss is permanent

0:52:24.870,0:52:31.060
Sasha Klein from Germany having a

0:52:28.240,0:52:35.380
disappointing outing back in 12th back

0:52:31.060,0:52:41.530
three-and-a-half somersault eight times

0:52:35.380,0:52:46.330
the European champion ah that's better

0:52:41.530,0:52:49.330
absolutely ripped that entry they're not

0:52:46.330,0:52:51.010
hiding behind a flag now from that

0:52:49.330,0:52:55.200
effort from musashi klein they're very

0:52:51.010,0:52:55.200
proud of it as he will be and should be

0:52:55.260,0:53:00.690
nice and tight in that pipe position

0:53:00.950,0:53:05.550
he's turning into a classic example of

0:53:03.660,0:53:07.530
that consistency word again as me

0:53:05.550,0:53:10.440
because he has shown he's got the real

0:53:07.530,0:53:13.500
talent but he just can't maintain that

0:53:10.440,0:53:18.840
superb level that the Chinese divers so

0:53:13.500,0:53:21.990
far have sustained any of these divers

0:53:18.840,0:53:24.000
in the top 12 can match the top one or

0:53:21.990,0:53:25.860
two once or twice but it's that

0:53:24.000,0:53:31.530
consistency that finds them out across

0:53:25.860,0:53:33.420
the six dives playing 72 holes a golf on

0:53:31.530,0:53:35.760
a turn of it isn't it see it's that

0:53:33.420,0:53:38.970
consistency day-in day-out dive in dive

0:53:35.760,0:53:40.910
out for Nick McCrory reverse three and a

0:53:38.970,0:53:45.090
half somersault he was back in night

0:53:40.910,0:53:47.460
coming into this the fourth dive you may

0:53:45.090,0:53:52.580
not be able to improve much here as he

0:53:47.460,0:53:52.580
leaps off a platform

0:53:53.720,0:53:59.119
see on the house and eights not yet

0:53:57.980,0:54:01.010
mentioned that a little bit of nice

0:53:59.119,0:54:03.680
trivia about his uncle Gordon Downey

0:54:01.010,0:54:07.460
winning a bronze for Great Britain in

0:54:03.680,0:54:11.000
the freestyle relay back in a 76 Olympic

0:54:07.460,0:54:13.400
Games keeping up the family tradition at

0:54:11.000,0:54:16.730
least by appearing in an Olympic final

0:54:13.400,0:54:22.880
which is some family tradition onto

0:54:16.730,0:54:27.160
Victor mini buy of again from Russia in

0:54:22.880,0:54:27.160
sixth place in his first Olympic Games

0:54:27.339,0:54:34.700
fourth in the World Championships the

0:54:29.869,0:54:36.470
current European silver medalist arm

0:54:34.700,0:54:41.030
stand back double somersault two and a

0:54:36.470,0:54:47.210
half twist three point six great angle

0:54:41.030,0:54:51.579
that yes it but better at the top and at

0:54:47.210,0:54:51.579
the bottom unfortunately from any buyers

0:54:55.270,0:55:00.079
not so special from the Russian but a

0:54:57.799,0:55:02.450
lot of these family connections with the

0:55:00.079,0:55:06.109
previous generation having metal you

0:55:02.450,0:55:08.180
find this out and Olympics muster FINA

0:55:06.109,0:55:10.190
in the artistic gymnastics you picked up

0:55:08.180,0:55:12.319
a gold medal on uneven bars you then

0:55:10.190,0:55:16.130
find out that her father was a bronze

0:55:12.319,0:55:18.829
medalist in greco-roman wrestling so it

0:55:16.130,0:55:20.750
often runs in families Russia have

0:55:18.829,0:55:24.650
110-meter medals at three of the last

0:55:20.750,0:55:29.750
four games but many by have have to go

0:55:24.650,0:55:32.660
some Martin Wolfram just slip back a bit

0:55:29.750,0:55:36.400
back through and a half somersault for

0:55:32.660,0:55:36.400
the twenty year old from Dresden

0:55:40.320,0:55:45.490
it's a bit of a crash-landing

0:55:42.610,0:55:47.320
I'm sad to say because Wolfram was

0:55:45.490,0:55:49.660
having a good competition especially

0:55:47.320,0:55:52.350
with his opening couple of dives and

0:55:49.660,0:55:56.400
it's just gone missing for him

0:55:52.350,0:56:00.130
confidence not there now

0:55:56.400,0:56:03.490
short on position coming into the water

0:56:00.130,0:56:06.760
and a well that's counting him out a

0:56:03.490,0:56:10.690
sixty-four point eight is a disaster in

0:56:06.760,0:56:13.869
a final and he may have just the

0:56:10.690,0:56:15.670
shoulder come in at the wrong angle Tom

0:56:13.869,0:56:18.400
Daly well the public barely have

0:56:15.670,0:56:21.640
discovered him four years ago but he was

0:56:18.400,0:56:23.680
on the sports radar when he was just ten

0:56:21.640,0:56:27.850
and was winning the national under-18

0:56:23.680,0:56:30.700
title which is phenomenal now at the

0:56:27.850,0:56:33.880
ripe old age of eighteen forward four

0:56:30.700,0:56:43.450
and a half somersaults 3.7 the tariff

0:56:33.880,0:56:47.380
here this is a biggie for Tom Daley well

0:56:43.450,0:56:49.540
the crowd tells you it was very good I'm

0:56:47.380,0:56:51.970
not convinced he was completely vertical

0:56:49.540,0:56:58.270
but I am convinced by the total lack of

0:56:51.970,0:57:03.400
splash and the judge has do like it they

0:56:58.270,0:57:07.450
like it a lot and that entry was very

0:57:03.400,0:57:11.530
good and a good tariff he's going to

0:57:07.450,0:57:13.780
reward him here and he is as well

0:57:11.530,0:57:16.930
contributing to a terrific atmosphere

0:57:13.780,0:57:19.900
here in the pool and I'm sure that the

0:57:16.930,0:57:22.480
other divers despite the waiting in the

0:57:19.900,0:57:24.310
support including mr. Beckham the other

0:57:22.480,0:57:26.590
divers will be enjoying the the

0:57:24.310,0:57:28.750
atmosphere that he's generating and the

0:57:26.590,0:57:34.300
scores that is his highest score of the

0:57:28.750,0:57:36.070
competition and 98 David Boudia has

0:57:34.300,0:57:36.550
shown that he can respond to a challenge

0:57:36.070,0:57:38.440
so far

0:57:36.550,0:57:40.980
reversed three and a half somersault

0:57:38.440,0:57:44.560
three point three a slightly lower

0:57:40.980,0:57:46.180
tariff for the student from Purdue

0:57:44.560,0:57:50.619
University

0:57:46.180,0:57:52.569
oh well yet again we left shaking our

0:57:50.619,0:57:56.410
heads to think we nearly didn't see this

0:57:52.569,0:58:00.369
man in the final because his diving is

0:57:56.410,0:58:02.289
right up there and he's not worried what

0:58:00.369,0:58:06.539
Tom Daly might do I have much noise he

0:58:02.289,0:58:08.529
gets he's very much focused on his dives

0:58:06.539,0:58:11.880
wonderfully tight tuck

0:58:08.529,0:58:16.839
oh and he's pulled a 10 that won't count

0:58:11.880,0:58:19.210
it's two alone you need three he's

0:58:16.839,0:58:22.270
starving like a man who seems to believe

0:58:19.210,0:58:27.299
that this might just be his moment da

0:58:22.270,0:58:27.299
real conviction ninety point seven five

0:58:27.390,0:58:31.390
picked up five points on his semi effort

0:58:30.670,0:58:35.260
with the same

0:58:31.390,0:58:37.059
now when you quietly and calmly getting

0:58:35.260,0:58:39.640
on with his job of racking up these

0:58:37.059,0:58:43.450
massively impressive dives forward four

0:58:39.640,0:58:45.880
and a half somersault tucked oh and

0:58:43.450,0:58:49.020
short all right now he is the little

0:58:45.880,0:58:57.369
error that opens the door to the medals

0:58:49.020,0:58:59.589
now we've not seen this before he had a

0:58:57.369,0:59:01.480
ninety four point three five in the semi

0:58:59.589,0:59:04.809
with this one but he's got a problem

0:59:01.480,0:59:07.299
right here he was very short bent at the

0:59:04.809,0:59:12.180
hips never got too vertical and the

0:59:07.299,0:59:12.180
judges could hardly have missed this

0:59:12.890,0:59:19.949
this could be really costly it's a big

0:59:16.410,0:59:22.430
deduction he's got two dives to try and

0:59:19.949,0:59:31.170
make up for what is a 68 for five and

0:59:22.430,0:59:35.509
down he tumbles well game on Cubo who's

0:59:31.170,0:59:37.769
even more impassive than his countryman

0:59:35.509,0:59:39.150
double world champion from the World

0:59:37.769,0:59:42.029
Championships last year

0:59:39.150,0:59:48.299
back three and a half somersault can be

0:59:42.029,0:59:50.609
a 100 point dive for this man and that's

0:59:48.299,0:59:54.689
what he got with it in the semi 102

0:59:50.609,0:59:58.140
point six is it that good again it's up

0:59:54.689,1:00:01.910
there maybe and splash a little bigger

0:59:58.140,1:00:05.549
than we saw this morning just

1:00:01.910,1:00:07.019
beautifully through the air the judges

1:00:05.549,1:00:09.769
can only like that's a very vertical

1:00:07.019,1:00:09.769
position

1:00:12.300,1:00:18.870
but not as good as the semi and that too

1:00:16.520,1:00:21.420
fancy Chinese competitors have got a

1:00:18.870,1:00:23.190
real battle on their hands to take what

1:00:21.420,1:00:25.410
everyone expected would be theirs

1:00:23.190,1:00:27.450
well they did say that this was China's

1:00:25.410,1:00:30.510
vulnerable event even though they lost

1:00:27.450,1:00:31.950
at three meters and suddenly look at

1:00:30.510,1:00:35.040
that David Boudia

1:00:31.950,1:00:37.440
from the United States in the lead Kubo

1:00:35.040,1:00:39.900
second Tom Daley in the bronze medal

1:00:37.440,1:00:42.660
position close a granite there's quite a

1:00:39.900,1:00:47.280
gap humble underneath Daley and Lynn UA

1:00:42.660,1:00:49.170
has out to fifth well what a shock at

1:00:47.280,1:00:50.610
the end of that round it's never over

1:00:49.170,1:00:53.610
till it's over

1:00:50.610,1:00:55.920
and maybe the pressure is even telling

1:00:53.610,1:00:58.620
on the Chinese divers that may well be

1:00:55.920,1:01:00.870
the key the excellence of butea the

1:00:58.620,1:01:04.370
growing pressure from Daley has put the

1:01:00.870,1:01:06.330
Chinese divers under unusual pressure

1:01:04.370,1:01:08.370
interesting to see that margin between

1:01:06.330,1:01:11.010
third and fourth daily with a little bit

1:01:08.370,1:01:14.070
of a buffer 21 points between him and

1:01:11.010,1:01:15.960
Guerra and that this is one lively

1:01:14.070,1:01:18.870
competition we've got now with two dives

1:01:15.960,1:01:23.100
to come from all 12 and the crowd really

1:01:18.870,1:01:27.450
know it has really brought this Aquatic

1:01:23.100,1:01:30.000
Center right to its feet round five of

1:01:27.450,1:01:31.980
six Riley McCormack leads off with a

1:01:30.000,1:01:36.750
reverse three and a half somersault

1:01:31.980,1:01:40.730
three point three the tariff he's diving

1:01:36.750,1:01:40.730
for his own personal standings now

1:01:42.790,1:01:50.329
well he kept it in nice and close to the

1:01:45.230,1:01:52.720
platform at the finish didn't complement

1:01:50.329,1:01:52.720
the start

1:01:56.760,1:02:03.810
six out just a little too early so I

1:01:59.520,1:02:07.140
overcome the feet past the vertical it's

1:02:03.810,1:02:13.560
it's a shame for him it was very solid

1:02:07.140,1:02:15.240
until the entry 21 later this month

1:02:13.560,1:02:18.210
Rowley mcCormick

1:02:15.240,1:02:22.680
still pretty early in his international

1:02:18.210,1:02:26.359
career see the analysis starts within

1:02:22.680,1:02:26.359
seconds of the completion of the dive

1:02:31.280,1:02:36.720
Alexander Banda from Ukraine 12 at the

1:02:35.520,1:02:38.030
moment reversed three and a half

1:02:36.720,1:02:40.800
somersault

1:02:38.030,1:02:46.530
well there was a really unusual kick out

1:02:40.800,1:02:48.030
there that the judges might penalize the

1:02:46.530,1:02:50.280
legs were on their way to straight he

1:02:48.030,1:02:52.530
had a second thought and kicked out

1:02:50.280,1:02:55.079
again see if you can notice here there

1:02:52.530,1:02:59.790
and again almost a double pump of the

1:02:55.079,1:03:02.040
knees Ukraine did only ever won two

1:02:59.790,1:03:05.339
Olympic diving medals both of them were

1:03:02.040,1:03:07.140
bronze you know Soviet Union had quite a

1:03:05.339,1:03:11.700
tradition of course so Ukraine trying to

1:03:07.140,1:03:13.079
create their own diving momentum the

1:03:11.700,1:03:15.240
judges are just having a little bit of a

1:03:13.079,1:03:18.359
struggle with that and they didn't like

1:03:15.240,1:03:21.030
it and I think it was the adjustment

1:03:18.359,1:03:23.190
that he's made there from four to seven

1:03:21.030,1:03:26.910
so someone's missed it and someone and a

1:03:23.190,1:03:28.440
couple haven't a little arrow that we

1:03:26.910,1:03:32.340
are discussing about

1:03:28.440,1:03:35.880
the leg straightening I think he's done

1:03:32.340,1:03:39.930
that to save himself and you know he's

1:03:35.880,1:03:43.620
been penalized for it even Garcia a

1:03:39.930,1:03:45.620
synchro silver medalist sixth-place

1:03:43.620,1:03:50.390
reversed three and a half somersault

1:03:45.620,1:03:54.830
three point three the tariff and a

1:03:50.390,1:03:58.790
little bit behind the breakaway Bunch

1:03:54.830,1:03:58.790
back at the peloton almost

1:04:11.620,1:04:17.900
well that's a great dive and it really

1:04:14.230,1:04:19.700
set itself up with tremendous Heidi got

1:04:17.900,1:04:22.340
off the platform you really took off

1:04:19.700,1:04:25.640
great her power seventy four point two

1:04:22.340,1:04:26.990
five for this one in the semis but he's

1:04:25.640,1:04:29.270
through one and a half somersaults

1:04:26.990,1:04:34.130
before even passes the platform and the

1:04:29.270,1:04:36.620
judges do like it he scored seven and a

1:04:34.130,1:04:39.800
half's in the semi he's pulled some

1:04:36.620,1:04:42.170
knives here he's produced some big dives

1:04:39.800,1:04:43.550
as well during the three competitions so

1:04:42.170,1:04:47.210
he's shown as well that he's got

1:04:43.550,1:04:48.740
terrific talents at just 18 no no if he

1:04:47.210,1:04:51.200
wanted more were tell you he's picked up

1:04:48.740,1:04:56.540
15 points and the corresponding dive

1:04:51.200,1:04:58.730
from the semi cozy where the senior

1:04:56.540,1:05:00.320
player out there tonight at 33 started

1:04:58.730,1:05:03.500
to keep going on about his age but in

1:05:00.320,1:05:05.720
such a teenage sport it is it's

1:05:03.500,1:05:09.860
something he should be proud of after

1:05:05.720,1:05:13.130
such a career three and a half

1:05:09.860,1:05:14.840
somersault was his fifth dive slap at

1:05:13.130,1:05:19.670
the hands as he pulled himself into that

1:05:14.840,1:05:25.390
tight tuck position such silence in the

1:05:19.670,1:05:25.390
room it's fantastic to hear a little fix

1:05:26.040,1:05:34.980
and help tell the story of what's going

1:05:28.109,1:05:37.800
on with Serena which is temporarily

1:05:34.980,1:05:41.040
extended out to 17,000 seats really has

1:05:37.800,1:05:42.750
a good echo effect and reverberates

1:05:41.040,1:05:50.460
around the sound which is helping create

1:05:42.750,1:05:52.650
this terrific atmosphere Sascha Klein

1:05:50.460,1:05:55.410
from Germany pulling herself up a bit

1:05:52.650,1:05:57.470
with a much better fourth dive this is

1:05:55.410,1:06:04.680
the reverse three and a half somersault

1:05:57.470,1:06:06.600
three point three you just know that

1:06:04.680,1:06:08.250
there's better stuff enemy a silver

1:06:06.600,1:06:13.619
medalist four years ago in the 10-meter

1:06:08.250,1:06:16.560
with the synchro and shadow enough in

1:06:13.619,1:06:18.510
preliminaries and semi to suggest he

1:06:16.560,1:06:24.390
could really make a challenge it's not

1:06:18.510,1:06:33.380
quite there it's tough it's supposed to

1:06:24.390,1:06:33.380
be tough and it certainly is 5/5

1:06:36.029,1:06:41.349
Nick McCrory might just be wondering if

1:06:39.489,1:06:46.900
he can benefit from that sudden change

1:06:41.349,1:06:49.119
in the top order after Lynne have that

1:06:46.900,1:06:54.160
problem he's got a back three and a half

1:06:49.119,1:06:55.900
somersault with a 3.3 tariff and not

1:06:54.160,1:07:02.589
much room for error if he wants to keep

1:06:55.900,1:07:04.930
up his scoring ratio he's the tallest

1:07:02.589,1:07:08.249
man in the field at 180 centimeters or

1:07:04.930,1:07:08.249
511 if that helps you

1:07:11.599,1:07:17.920
so he certainly creates some long lines

1:07:13.849,1:07:22.180
through the air but it's about execution

1:07:17.920,1:07:22.180
nice job done by McCrory

1:07:27.070,1:07:35.070
those long limbs through the air the

1:07:29.230,1:07:38.230
arms hands flat to create a necessary

1:07:35.070,1:07:41.380
opportunity to pull the unit down after

1:07:38.230,1:07:49.300
him below the water and I'm eighty four

1:07:41.380,1:07:52.420
one five Victor MIDI by of seventh place

1:07:49.300,1:07:55.030
after the fourth round back three and a

1:07:52.420,1:07:57.370
half somersault now with three point six

1:07:55.030,1:07:59.110
the tariff they're strapping to give

1:07:57.370,1:08:06.100
extra support on the wrists they do take

1:07:59.110,1:08:06.790
a pounding as they enter the water deep

1:08:06.100,1:08:10.650
breaths

1:08:06.790,1:08:10.650
to get himself totally composed

1:08:13.680,1:08:22.420
excellent job but it was worth the wait

1:08:15.670,1:08:26.159
wasn't it got himself set and he adopts

1:08:22.420,1:08:30.040
a a really attractive Pike position here

1:08:26.159,1:08:33.250
it's not as tight as some in terms of

1:08:30.040,1:08:40.870
getting the face down onto the knees but

1:08:33.250,1:08:44.670
elegant and scores in the eights from

1:08:40.870,1:08:44.670
ninety one point eight well done Victor

1:08:50.339,1:08:59.650
Martin Wolfram from Germany next up slip

1:08:55.600,1:09:03.850
back after some terrific opening dives

1:08:59.650,1:09:07.210
this is his biggest test in terms of

1:09:03.850,1:09:11.440
level of competition and finding it a

1:09:07.210,1:09:14.819
little tough as it goes on back to a

1:09:11.440,1:09:20.380
half somersault two and a half twists

1:09:14.819,1:09:22.089
three point six the tariff and after his

1:09:20.380,1:09:25.510
dive he's got a deal with the dinner

1:09:22.089,1:09:28.089
that is for Tom Daly he's done a nice

1:09:25.510,1:09:35.710
job here though and a high scoring die

1:09:28.089,1:09:38.109
for him of 88.2 very quickly into the

1:09:35.710,1:09:40.630
twists and then try and get the

1:09:38.109,1:09:46.720
alignment right after all of that for

1:09:40.630,1:09:51.730
the entry you can hear the chairs

1:09:46.720,1:09:53.410
building Tom Daly is up next really put

1:09:51.730,1:09:55.330
himself in with a great chance in the

1:09:53.410,1:09:59.320
timmy to syncro with Peter Waterfield

1:09:55.330,1:10:02.560
before the fourth dive went wrong but he

1:09:59.320,1:10:04.960
is right in the metal frame now almost a

1:10:02.560,1:10:09.070
hundred with his previous dive this is a

1:10:04.960,1:10:11.890
three point six tariff back three and a

1:10:09.070,1:10:13.750
half somersault piked for the 18-year

1:10:11.890,1:10:16.750
old

1:10:13.750,1:10:19.330
Oh another good one he's really

1:10:16.750,1:10:29.140
channeling the goodwill in the room that

1:10:19.330,1:10:31.900
is all for him a lot of smiling faces in

1:10:29.140,1:10:34.780
the Aquatic Center as Tom Daly continues

1:10:31.900,1:10:40.150
to press for a medal with some stunning

1:10:34.780,1:10:42.310
dives and some ripped entries and like

1:10:40.150,1:10:46.000
so many British athletes he's just

1:10:42.310,1:10:48.360
loving being in London it's been a great

1:10:46.000,1:10:50.950
night already for Britain with Mo Farah

1:10:48.360,1:10:52.660
winning the 5000 meters just a few

1:10:50.950,1:10:55.360
hundred yards away on the track and Tom

1:10:52.660,1:10:57.580
Daley is on the charge and he's picked

1:10:55.360,1:11:02.350
up another six points on his semi final

1:10:57.580,1:11:06.250
dive for the same so watch out David

1:11:02.350,1:11:10.090
budaya losing the fact that he's now on

1:11:06.250,1:11:13.560
the board and he too has got the scent

1:11:10.090,1:11:17.260
of medals he was leading the competition

1:11:13.560,1:11:19.420
and after four rounds must be - the

1:11:17.260,1:11:23.710
biggest times of his life coming up back

1:11:19.420,1:11:26.200
three and a half somersault another good

1:11:23.710,1:11:30.190
one from the guy just a little too much

1:11:26.200,1:11:34.060
water coming up from the entry but high

1:11:30.190,1:11:37.510
tariffs three six he's going to come

1:11:34.060,1:11:41.580
under some pressure though not sure if

1:11:37.510,1:11:41.580
it was as good as Daly's

1:11:45.820,1:11:52.050
and it wasn't he's gonna slot in just

1:11:49.360,1:11:56.320
behind him there's nothing in it

1:11:52.050,1:11:57.950
so he's for 6605 to dailies for sixty

1:11:56.320,1:12:01.220
six point two

1:11:57.950,1:12:01.220
[Music]

1:12:02.160,1:12:07.960
again the commentator at the venue

1:12:05.350,1:12:11.590
appealing to respect the divers turn off

1:12:07.960,1:12:13.630
the flashes now perhaps not hot the

1:12:11.590,1:12:17.050
build-up to dailies dives well we

1:12:13.630,1:12:18.850
mentioned maybe some spectators here

1:12:17.050,1:12:19.840
don't understand the instruction then

1:12:18.850,1:12:22.630
there'd be some others that don't

1:12:19.840,1:12:27.180
understand their camera just how to turn

1:12:22.630,1:12:29.770
it off or both yeah Lynn you a now and

1:12:27.180,1:12:33.490
it's all threatening to go very wrong

1:12:29.770,1:12:35.500
for a 21 year old arm stand back double

1:12:33.490,1:12:38.040
somersault two and a half twists with a

1:12:35.500,1:12:40.870
three point six tariffs and he needs

1:12:38.040,1:12:50.130
something rather special to get back in

1:12:40.870,1:12:50.130
the frame that was better

1:12:50.330,1:12:53.810
he might have been a little concerned

1:12:51.980,1:12:58.360
about this dive that he only scored

1:12:53.810,1:12:58.360
seventy five point six within the semies

1:12:59.140,1:13:05.750
well he's beaten Chu in the past he's

1:13:02.480,1:13:08.210
been a 600 plus scorer set a record at

1:13:05.750,1:13:12.590
the national championships this was his

1:13:08.210,1:13:15.080
big day I just want to see these scores

1:13:12.590,1:13:17.360
from the judges confirmed on the screen

1:13:15.080,1:13:21.500
here though I think there's a little bit

1:13:17.360,1:13:25.340
of a range here now that's okay eight to

1:13:21.500,1:13:30.940
nine that's alright eight and a half's

1:13:25.340,1:13:34.850
count is behind both Daly and the diet

1:13:30.940,1:13:39.560
cubone out very much the favorite very

1:13:34.850,1:13:41.930
much under pressure now forward four and

1:13:39.560,1:13:45.770
a half somersault three point seven the

1:13:41.930,1:13:48.230
tariff big tariff dive so hard to

1:13:45.770,1:13:54.140
control budaya did a spectacular job

1:13:48.230,1:13:56.300
with his four and a half not very

1:13:54.140,1:14:01.160
sporting that the cheers I suspect and

1:13:56.300,1:14:03.380
not because it's brilliant it's a ninety

1:14:01.160,1:14:06.980
four point three five it's a great dive

1:14:03.380,1:14:09.470
but the cheers are because he's not top

1:14:06.980,1:14:12.740
of the leaderboard leaderboard and the

1:14:09.470,1:14:15.110
British crowd is going nuts here but Tom

1:14:12.740,1:14:15.620
Daly who will lead going into the final

1:14:15.110,1:14:18.380
round

1:14:15.620,1:14:20.450
I hope this temporary stand is well it

1:14:18.380,1:14:23.030
truly made because the roof is

1:14:20.450,1:14:27.260
threatening to go off and the

1:14:23.030,1:14:31.010
unbelievable beforehand is a possibility

1:14:27.260,1:14:34.070
top of the board after round five it is

1:14:31.010,1:14:37.010
a hero of Great Britain Tom Daley and

1:14:34.070,1:14:39.530
look how close look at that point one

1:14:37.010,1:14:42.950
five it's virtually neck-and-neck it's

1:14:39.530,1:14:46.450
as close as you can get to a photo well

1:14:42.950,1:14:48.680
what a competition this this is it's a

1:14:46.450,1:14:51.400
well it's one a way to bring down the

1:14:48.680,1:14:54.070
curtain unbelievable

1:14:51.400,1:14:57.490
well as we say back home no more than a

1:14:54.070,1:15:02.040
struck match between them Allah becomes

1:14:57.490,1:15:05.140
just still loving it as we all are - and

1:15:02.040,1:15:07.330
just repeat that score so daily is a

1:15:05.140,1:15:09.910
head of Buddha and chuubo who are both

1:15:07.330,1:15:12.400
tied four six six oh five two four six

1:15:09.910,1:15:15.040
six point two oh and then there's a gap

1:15:12.400,1:15:17.260
tool in UAE you would think the three

1:15:15.040,1:15:22.140
medals barring disaster are with the top

1:15:17.260,1:15:27.130
three cool I can't believe those scores

1:15:22.140,1:15:31.030
466 points is the leading scorer and

1:15:27.130,1:15:32.740
just point to less than point two

1:15:31.030,1:15:35.110
separating the top three daughters

1:15:32.740,1:15:39.190
unlike in gymnastics if the level share

1:15:35.110,1:15:41.230
the medals Riley McCormick now it's the

1:15:39.190,1:15:45.300
final round back three and a half

1:15:41.230,1:15:45.300
somersault he's in 11th position

1:15:51.960,1:15:59.740
excellent excellent diver it's high hard

1:15:55.690,1:16:01.480
to focus on the boys starting this sixth

1:15:59.740,1:16:03.460
and final round when you know the real

1:16:01.480,1:16:08.430
action is in the last three or four but

1:16:03.460,1:16:08.430
this was a great dive from the court

1:16:09.000,1:16:14.320
well he's reached the final he didn't

1:16:11.350,1:16:19.420
manage Valley Beijing when he was just

1:16:14.320,1:16:22.480
16 and he'll be pleased at the progress

1:16:19.420,1:16:25.030
he's made student from Arizona State in

1:16:22.480,1:16:27.690
the United States and a good finish by

1:16:25.030,1:16:27.690
the looks of it

1:16:28.690,1:16:33.460
well there it is now ninety five point

1:16:31.360,1:16:35.679
four not I'm wondering if he's saying

1:16:33.460,1:16:37.840
where was that earlier because I really

1:16:35.679,1:16:40.020
could have finished a little higher well

1:16:37.840,1:16:40.020
done

1:16:42.810,1:16:49.719
Alexander Bondar now from Ukraine he's

1:16:46.810,1:16:52.590
twelve back two and a half somersault

1:16:49.719,1:16:55.590
two and a half twists for the

1:16:52.590,1:16:55.590
eighteen-year-old

1:16:58.560,1:17:04.780
they all want to finish off with a good

1:17:01.810,1:17:06.580
solid performance and a feel good for

1:17:04.780,1:17:09.639
what's been a brilliant competition so

1:17:06.580,1:17:11.860
far back to an off summer so two and a

1:17:09.639,1:17:14.190
half twist then three point six the

1:17:11.860,1:17:14.190
tariff

1:17:15.620,1:17:24.570
just a little untidy we mentioned an

1:17:22.650,1:17:29.610
earlier session one day like to be the

1:17:24.570,1:17:31.650
Ukraine sports minister he sets his

1:17:29.610,1:17:33.540
sights high but that was all there were

1:17:31.650,1:17:35.550
all sorts of problems there in execution

1:17:33.540,1:17:39.690
the the knees were bent the ankles went

1:17:35.550,1:17:43.790
together sort of lost the thread really

1:17:39.690,1:17:47.040
even so it won't be a great scoring dive

1:17:43.790,1:17:50.600
for 18-year old he will have his sights

1:17:47.040,1:17:50.600
set on Rio

1:17:51.710,1:17:57.750
not quite the sign-off that he was

1:17:54.030,1:18:00.330
looking for was peering ahead to those

1:17:57.750,1:18:04.550
last few dives that await us Roger

1:18:00.330,1:18:07.320
Tom Daley has got the least tariff of

1:18:04.550,1:18:08.520
the contenders so he's really going to

1:18:07.320,1:18:16.830
have to come up with something special

1:18:08.520,1:18:19.020
even Garcia great chance of Mexican

1:18:16.830,1:18:20.580
Mitchum doing there enjoying himself he

1:18:19.020,1:18:24.300
can help himself he missed the final

1:18:20.580,1:18:26.370
just by a place no chance to defend

1:18:24.300,1:18:28.230
Fairplay to come out tonight and be full

1:18:26.370,1:18:31.800
of it for with two and a half somersault

1:18:28.230,1:18:36.200
three twists 3.8 at the end of a a bold

1:18:31.800,1:18:36.200
program by Evan Garcia of Mexico

1:18:38.520,1:18:43.249
[Applause]

1:18:43.350,1:18:47.430
a couple of gold medals at the

1:18:44.760,1:18:49.290
pan-american games last year in the

1:18:47.430,1:18:55.770
10-meter platform and the synchro

1:18:49.290,1:18:59.700
10-meter and that silver medal in the

1:18:55.770,1:19:02.700
bag for the timid a synchro event so he

1:18:59.700,1:19:05.720
and the Mexicans have had a good Olympic

1:19:02.700,1:19:05.720
Games in the diving pool

1:19:11.130,1:19:16.710
mr. a little pause in the judging

1:19:13.290,1:19:22.520
therefore Ivan and the 87 point for his

1:19:16.710,1:19:25.590
competition concludes roll down to him

1:19:22.520,1:19:27.480
good to see the coach and the diver

1:19:25.590,1:19:29.970
there all the hard work they've all put

1:19:27.480,1:19:31.860
in together Tom Daley

1:19:29.970,1:19:35.940
what he's going through his young mind

1:19:31.860,1:19:37.950
mm-hmm Jose Guerra first of all has to

1:19:35.940,1:19:40.470
dive back two and a half somersault two

1:19:37.950,1:19:44.280
and a half twists three point six he's

1:19:40.470,1:19:53.190
in seventh place I said one more time

1:19:44.280,1:19:56.640
the 33 year old a wonderful finish from

1:19:53.190,1:19:59.460
him he does already have his own slice

1:19:56.640,1:20:01.590
of history for his nation with a second

1:19:59.460,1:20:03.600
placing at the o-5 world's in Montreal

1:20:01.590,1:20:08.540
Cuba's first world championship medal

1:20:03.600,1:20:08.540
and he continues to compete at the top a

1:20:09.290,1:20:13.790
wonderful final diver from where'er

1:20:14.120,1:20:18.170
oldest diver in the competition

1:20:20.429,1:20:29.159
well what a great sign off that is

1:20:23.150,1:20:31.199
ninety seven point two well I'm truly

1:20:29.159,1:20:34.140
eclipsing anything he scored in the

1:20:31.199,1:20:37.909
semies respect is the word I think

1:20:34.140,1:20:41.520
respect and we're getting close

1:20:37.909,1:20:46.050
Sasha Klein back to a half somersault

1:20:41.520,1:20:51.090
two and a half twists tenth position for

1:20:46.050,1:20:53.640
the twenty six-year-old already has an

1:20:51.090,1:20:56.190
Olympic silver from Beijing in the

1:20:53.640,1:20:58.980
synchro back to half somersault two and

1:20:56.190,1:21:06.390
a half twist then three point six to

1:20:58.980,1:21:09.980
conclude we're seeing some divers finish

1:21:06.390,1:21:09.980
off their competition very nicely

1:21:11.390,1:21:21.270
Sasha Klein gesture a little erratic on

1:21:15.929,1:21:27.239
the finals night needed six times like

1:21:21.270,1:21:28.710
that got a different outcome but well

1:21:27.239,1:21:32.900
done to hold it together for his final

1:21:28.710,1:21:32.900
dive knowing was out of contention

1:21:39.659,1:21:45.210
just the scoring from the judges seems

1:21:42.239,1:21:47.130
to have slowed down Roger I couldn't

1:21:45.210,1:21:48.810
even guess why that might be but maybe

1:21:47.130,1:21:50.580
the tension getting to them to knowing

1:21:48.810,1:21:52.260
what's sitting in front of them

1:21:50.580,1:21:55.530
trying to separate three divers with

1:21:52.260,1:21:57.659
point one favor between them I want to

1:21:55.530,1:21:59.820
make sure they get it right what's right

1:21:57.659,1:22:03.030
as you can do in what is a subjective

1:21:59.820,1:22:10.350
sport after all now Mick McCrory from

1:22:03.030,1:22:14.179
the United States 21 year old sixth in

1:22:10.350,1:22:19.980
the world championships last year know

1:22:14.179,1:22:23.639
going into this final dive oh and

1:22:19.980,1:22:27.980
another excellent final dive from their

1:22:23.639,1:22:27.980
finalists McCrory well done

1:22:29.210,1:22:35.250
maybe the whole occasion the drama the

1:22:31.980,1:22:37.949
crowd the atmosphere is getting to all

1:22:35.250,1:22:43.530
of them willing them to put on a real

1:22:37.949,1:22:47.060
show special night he did score a 90 for

1:22:43.530,1:22:47.060
this dive in the semis

1:22:48.310,1:22:56.650
and a ninety seven point two it speaks

1:22:53.860,1:22:59.400
to their endurance and concentration

1:22:56.650,1:23:02.910
that they can pull out another big dive

1:22:59.400,1:23:02.910
to finish it off

1:23:09.740,1:23:16.500
Victor Mille buyers 5th place back to a

1:23:13.350,1:23:19.110
half somersault two and a half twist out

1:23:16.500,1:23:20.850
of the middle frame but he's had a good

1:23:19.110,1:23:30.300
competition in his first olympic games

1:23:20.850,1:23:33.200
the 21 year old certainly not short of

1:23:30.300,1:23:33.200
high tariffs dives

1:23:43.800,1:23:52.820
and yet another top dive many buyers

1:23:49.920,1:23:56.880
last three days are all 3.6

1:23:52.820,1:24:01.220
well he's second is a 3.7 sets the bar

1:23:56.880,1:24:09.360
high and he has cleared it easily here

1:24:01.220,1:24:11.510
in style sense of anticipation around

1:24:09.360,1:24:17.040
this pool as we get nearer to these

1:24:11.510,1:24:19.890
crucial final dives and a ninety one

1:24:17.040,1:24:22.380
point eight for Victor brings a smile

1:24:19.890,1:24:23.910
and as he finishes his Olympic campaign

1:24:22.380,1:24:26.340
I just hope the crowd has some

1:24:23.910,1:24:27.690
appreciation of what a difference the

1:24:26.340,1:24:28.920
degree of difficulty is going to make

1:24:27.690,1:24:31.830
for Tom Daley

1:24:28.920,1:24:36.480
he's jumping into the water with a 3.3

1:24:31.830,1:24:41.160
and the others three point six Martin

1:24:36.480,1:24:42.570
bull from eighth place going into this

1:24:41.160,1:24:44.700
final dive which is a forward

1:24:42.570,1:24:48.540
four-and-a-half somersault with a three

1:24:44.700,1:24:50.690
point seven tariff in his first Olympic

1:24:48.540,1:24:50.690
Games

1:24:55.120,1:25:02.860
but that shoulder issue it's not even

1:25:00.070,1:25:04.450
paddling with that arm I hope he hasn't

1:25:02.860,1:25:08.560
done something serious here and I think

1:25:04.450,1:25:14.080
he has he looks even he is struggling he

1:25:08.560,1:25:18.760
is in trouble and this is most

1:25:14.080,1:25:20.860
concerning his hope he hasn't suffered a

1:25:18.760,1:25:26.680
little dislocation there he's managed to

1:25:20.860,1:25:29.200
get himself up onto the pool edge that

1:25:26.680,1:25:34.270
looks like a dislocation to me what a

1:25:29.200,1:25:35.120
way to end that's not the case but he's

1:25:34.270,1:25:38.630
in trouble

1:25:35.120,1:25:40.910
[Applause]

1:25:38.630,1:25:43.730
I'll just try and keep that stabilized

1:25:40.910,1:25:48.320
but I don't like the way that hanging

1:25:43.730,1:25:50.390
yes a little bone pointing the way it

1:25:48.320,1:25:55.910
should not so that is the danger of this

1:25:50.390,1:25:57.860
sport now well now we come down to what

1:25:55.910,1:25:59.870
it's all about if we didn't have enough

1:25:57.860,1:26:04.850
drama right we've got an injury and now

1:25:59.870,1:26:07.100
a nation hoping that Tom Daley can

1:26:04.850,1:26:11.750
produce something special the biggest

1:26:07.100,1:26:17.840
two seconds of his life ahead of him Tom

1:26:11.750,1:26:19.730
Daley leading in gold medal position his

1:26:17.840,1:26:22.330
final dive just at three point three

1:26:19.730,1:26:26.350
tariffs on a reverse three and a half

1:26:22.330,1:26:30.640
somersault but he is diving for gold

1:26:26.350,1:26:38.840
must extract maximum value from this one

1:26:30.640,1:26:44.140
silence oh it's good oh it's better than

1:26:38.840,1:26:44.140
good they're on their feet they love him

1:26:45.220,1:26:51.440
he knows it's good I think he's

1:26:48.050,1:26:53.870
relishing in the reception too he's laid

1:26:51.440,1:26:56.990
down the challenge you beat me if you're

1:26:53.870,1:26:59.410
good enough at last we see that Daley

1:26:56.990,1:26:59.410
smile

1:27:01.030,1:27:10.510
Oh cometh the Romans baby cometh Tom

1:27:05.500,1:27:12.490
daily 90.7 5 he's just beating his score

1:27:10.510,1:27:16.210
from the semi when he also had some

1:27:12.490,1:27:18.030
nines in there this was beautiful tight

1:27:16.210,1:27:20.170
tuck look at the finish here

1:27:18.030,1:27:22.450
absolutely vertical by the time he hits

1:27:20.170,1:27:27.040
the water the splash is barely there and

1:27:22.450,1:27:28.720
he is richly rewarded but hold on folks

1:27:27.040,1:27:31.210
because there's some tough dives with

1:27:28.720,1:27:33.280
bigger difficulty coming he knows so

1:27:31.210,1:27:42.100
that he has put on the big show and he

1:27:33.280,1:27:44.140
will be delighted at that and the young

1:27:42.100,1:27:46.390
lad comes through for the first time

1:27:44.140,1:27:49.060
rather than the more introverted figure

1:27:46.390,1:27:53.050
in competition now David Boudia has

1:27:49.060,1:27:56.740
responded to every challenge amateur

1:27:53.050,1:27:58.990
American diver now this he will believe

1:27:56.740,1:28:00.820
is his moment three point six his Terry

1:27:58.990,1:28:02.410
forgot I've emphasized that back two and

1:28:00.820,1:28:08.800
a half somersault two and a half twist

1:28:02.410,1:28:10.810
oh it's good - and Tom Daley's got to be

1:28:08.800,1:28:13.510
concerned about that it only needs to

1:28:10.810,1:28:18.790
beat him by one point and he's out of

1:28:13.510,1:28:21.910
the gold medal position and budaya waits

1:28:18.790,1:28:25.840
and hopes what a competition he's put

1:28:21.910,1:28:28.960
together 24 hours ago he was nearly out

1:28:25.840,1:28:31.930
of it he is relaxed he said he relaxed

1:28:28.960,1:28:33.070
and he's been enjoying it and this is

1:28:31.930,1:28:37.900
nail-biting

1:28:33.070,1:28:39.760
oh he's there oh he's more than there a

1:28:37.900,1:28:47.020
hundred and 2.6

1:28:39.760,1:28:51.840
he has stormed to top position oh what a

1:28:47.020,1:28:51.840
moment for this man a career highlights

1:28:53.110,1:28:58.220
it's not over yet there's still the

1:28:56.150,1:29:02.060
favorite to go

1:28:58.220,1:29:04.670
not to mention Lin you a only one diver

1:29:02.060,1:29:08.120
in the last three games from China was

1:29:04.670,1:29:10.310
missed out on a 10 meter medal so he

1:29:08.120,1:29:12.230
will be feeling in this rare opportunity

1:29:10.310,1:29:15.710
to compete individually that he has

1:29:12.230,1:29:18.680
missed the boat back to an a half

1:29:15.710,1:29:21.290
somersault till the half twists it's not

1:29:18.680,1:29:24.230
good enough there was a separation of

1:29:21.290,1:29:26.870
the ankles the entry wasn't quite right

1:29:24.230,1:29:31.150
and it's not quite good enough I would

1:29:26.870,1:29:33.770
feel leave it to the judges but

1:29:31.150,1:29:39.260
uncharacteristically the ankles not

1:29:33.770,1:29:43.700
locked together the splash too big the

1:29:39.260,1:29:46.170
chance for medals they're not used to it

1:29:43.700,1:29:49.440
general in

1:29:46.170,1:29:50.700
the Women's Champion we saw down there

1:29:49.440,1:29:52.980
on the bench they're all out there

1:29:50.700,1:29:56.220
supporting they came here for the clean

1:29:52.980,1:29:58.650
sweep of eight golds they're looking for

1:29:56.220,1:30:01.530
seven they may have to settle for six

1:29:58.650,1:30:02.460
Tom Daley knows he's got a middle it's

1:30:01.530,1:30:06.030
just what color

1:30:02.460,1:30:09.870
so does budaya there's just one man to

1:30:06.030,1:30:12.450
come could see the pressure just lifted

1:30:09.870,1:30:14.930
off Tom Daley that read I've that

1:30:12.450,1:30:18.840
opening read I've world

1:30:14.930,1:30:20.400
Kubo the pre-race favorite as it were

1:30:18.840,1:30:22.770
back two and a half somersault two and a

1:30:20.400,1:30:28.590
half twist the last dive of these

1:30:22.770,1:30:32.400
Olympic Games what a competition well it

1:30:28.590,1:30:36.680
was good but is it a hundred dive but

1:30:32.400,1:30:39.630
Dyer might be the man she roll off that

1:30:36.680,1:30:42.480
2009 World Championships to Tom Daley

1:30:39.630,1:30:47.070
right in the final dive he knows what

1:30:42.480,1:30:48.840
it's like just not quite perfect with

1:30:47.070,1:30:51.620
the entry there was a bigger splash than

1:30:48.840,1:30:55.980
we're used to seeing from this man

1:30:51.620,1:30:57.900
through the air beautiful the finish not

1:30:55.980,1:31:02.250
the very best impression he could leave

1:30:57.900,1:31:04.110
he wants to see what this is and he's

1:31:02.250,1:31:09.660
forced his way between birdurer and

1:31:04.110,1:31:12.780
Daley so but Dyer is your champion David

1:31:09.660,1:31:15.140
Boudia of American foes in the great

1:31:12.780,1:31:18.690
tradition the great days are back for

1:31:15.140,1:31:21.720
American diving and the Chinese have to

1:31:18.690,1:31:25.460
settle for second place with Cuba the

1:31:21.720,1:31:28.350
favorite Tom Daley gets the bronze a

1:31:25.460,1:31:30.840
brilliant dramatic staggering

1:31:28.350,1:31:33.750
competition and David Boudia

1:31:30.840,1:31:38.490
comes out of the pool on top of the

1:31:33.750,1:31:40.250
world well it's a competition that

1:31:38.490,1:31:44.730
anyone who's seen it here or at home

1:31:40.250,1:31:48.410
will remember for many a day we've had

1:31:44.730,1:31:50.850
all sorts of drama here but to bow is

1:31:48.410,1:31:55.510
crushed

1:31:50.850,1:31:58.060
coming up short coming up short 29.5 and

1:31:55.510,1:32:01.000
a nine and that is not enough for Tom

1:31:58.060,1:32:03.700
Daley knows how tough it is to get a

1:32:01.000,1:32:07.780
medal in this 10 metre platform diving

1:32:03.700,1:32:11.500
event and he is the first Britney since

1:32:07.780,1:32:17.590
Brian Phelps back in 1960 52 years ago

1:32:11.500,1:32:21.430
and David booty bringing the good times

1:32:17.590,1:32:25.750
back to diving in the United States he

1:32:21.430,1:32:28.330
has to settle Steve your thoughts well

1:32:25.750,1:32:31.000
I'm just staggered at birdies

1:32:28.330,1:32:32.650
competition you know last night and he

1:32:31.000,1:32:35.230
was inconsistent he was all over the

1:32:32.650,1:32:38.440
place he fell into the brook into the

1:32:35.230,1:32:40.390
semi-final then he impressed us good

1:32:38.440,1:32:45.730
diet by qualifying in third best

1:32:40.390,1:32:48.760
position and now he's won it and that

1:32:45.730,1:32:54.130
top score of 100 and 2.6 for his final

1:32:48.760,1:32:56.830
dive just blew them away and Kubo five

1:32:54.130,1:32:58.690
dives in the 90 and a 100 not good

1:32:56.830,1:33:01.390
enough that tells you how good bird I

1:32:58.690,1:33:04.720
was and Tom Daley has thrilled this

1:33:01.390,1:33:06.640
British crown I'm just just feel

1:33:04.720,1:33:09.250
privileged to be sitting here to have

1:33:06.640,1:33:11.340
seen it and to have enjoyed it and to

1:33:09.250,1:33:15.940
watch these men under pressure perform

1:33:11.340,1:33:18.160
so exciting a new experience this for a

1:33:15.940,1:33:20.710
massive crowd not used to big crowds in

1:33:18.160,1:33:23.230
diving events in this country and they

1:33:20.710,1:33:27.310
have seen something quite unforgettable

1:33:23.230,1:33:31.090
and never presume it's over to bow a

1:33:27.310,1:33:32.760
tearful figure he has had his success

1:33:31.090,1:33:36.910
daily budaya

1:33:32.760,1:33:38.920
23 year old from Abilene in Texas will

1:33:36.910,1:33:42.420
feel that he has worked for this and

1:33:38.920,1:33:46.690
he's worked for this over three sessions

1:33:42.420,1:33:48.010
general in their sharing the tears they

1:33:46.690,1:33:51.400
went together and lose together the

1:33:48.010,1:33:53.980
Chinese team but the Stars and Stripes

1:33:51.400,1:33:56.860
are getting ready to be unfurled and

1:33:53.980,1:33:59.320
hang high a great respect from all the

1:33:56.860,1:34:01.070
divers they know this has been a great

1:33:59.320,1:34:05.780
competition

1:34:01.070,1:34:08.480
well they were expected to and lean to

1:34:05.780,1:34:10.250
take the top two places but there's only

1:34:08.480,1:34:16.970
room for one of them on the podium and

1:34:10.250,1:34:19.550
it'll be a silver medal and Padilla's

1:34:16.970,1:34:22.910
come from tenth four years ago to first

1:34:19.550,1:34:24.980
in London it's been a long journey and a

1:34:22.910,1:34:28.100
very successful and happy one for him

1:34:24.980,1:34:34.790
now he's dominated at home in the state

1:34:28.100,1:34:37.460
16 national titles he's won the United

1:34:34.790,1:34:40.550
States this is their one hundred and

1:34:37.460,1:34:43.070
twenty ninth diving medal they used to

1:34:40.550,1:34:45.920
dominate before the Chinese entered the

1:34:43.070,1:34:47.720
games and then stole their show but now

1:34:45.920,1:34:51.110
this will mean so much to them to be

1:34:47.720,1:34:52.880
back on top of the platform and we know

1:34:51.110,1:34:55.250
about David that you know originally

1:34:52.880,1:34:56.930
with this discipline he was scared of

1:34:55.250,1:34:58.790
heights he had some work done with the

1:34:56.930,1:35:01.490
sports psychologist he now describes it

1:34:58.790,1:35:03.260
as a walk in the park well wherever he

1:35:01.490,1:35:04.760
walks now he's going to be recognized as

1:35:03.260,1:35:07.450
a gold medalist and someone who won a

1:35:04.760,1:35:10.490
most extraordinary competition here and

1:35:07.450,1:35:14.120
by less than two points from Chabot and

1:35:10.490,1:35:17.090
Tom Daley sin behind a true bow but well

1:35:14.120,1:35:20.480
clear a victim in a buy of an absolutely

1:35:17.090,1:35:22.880
worthy medalist oh my goodness what a

1:35:20.480,1:35:25.880
competition Roger Lynn you a will be

1:35:22.880,1:35:29.060
distraught their expectations and the

1:35:25.880,1:35:30.590
pressure on them is so high and for many

1:35:29.060,1:35:32.720
of these divers their time will come

1:35:30.590,1:35:35.120
again just teenagers half the field

1:35:32.720,1:35:39.920
remember it was their first Olympic

1:35:35.120,1:35:43.370
Games and the great look Greg Louganis

1:35:39.920,1:35:48.050
being introduced to the crowd they the

1:35:43.370,1:35:50.300
real Idol of American diving an iconic

1:35:48.050,1:35:53.480
figure and he more than anyone will be

1:35:50.300,1:35:58.820
delighted to see an American ride at the

1:35:53.480,1:36:01.460
top of diving's blue-ribbon event such a

1:35:58.820,1:36:03.680
buzz in this place as well you don't

1:36:01.460,1:36:06.620
have to know a lot about diving to know

1:36:03.680,1:36:09.050
you've been at something special now the

1:36:06.620,1:36:14.960
gayness a winner of this event

1:36:09.050,1:36:23.120
in Los Angeles and soul class de Bercy

1:36:14.960,1:36:25.940
of Italy one at three in a row the

1:36:23.120,1:36:28.070
British team all in there they know what

1:36:25.940,1:36:30.680
pressure tom has been under of course

1:36:28.070,1:36:34.220
his father died and he'd been such a

1:36:30.680,1:36:36.440
support and a presence to him he'd be

1:36:34.220,1:36:39.460
bullied at school all his life seems to

1:36:36.440,1:36:42.920
be played out in a public spotlight Bert

1:36:39.460,1:36:45.770
and let's go back again to that first

1:36:42.920,1:36:47.900
dive where he was distracted by camera

1:36:45.770,1:36:50.930
flashes in the crowd he was given a

1:36:47.900,1:36:53.750
seventy five point six wisely he and his

1:36:50.930,1:36:56.780
coach appealed FINA took a sympathetic

1:36:53.750,1:36:58.760
view here II dived and went from seventy

1:36:56.780,1:37:03.830
five point six to ninety one point two

1:36:58.760,1:37:07.400
and that proved absolutely crucial took

1:37:03.830,1:37:10.970
some nerve to to do that to have the the

1:37:07.400,1:37:14.180
professionalism to say that it's it's

1:37:10.970,1:37:15.700
all history now actually when you look

1:37:14.180,1:37:18.830
at the margin between third and fourth

1:37:15.700,1:37:20.720
it was more than that the fifteen points

1:37:18.830,1:37:23.120
so in the end there won't be any

1:37:20.720,1:37:26.450
protests from those beneath him because

1:37:23.120,1:37:28.430
he was so clearly in third place and

1:37:26.450,1:37:30.110
that's of some comfort I think to anyone

1:37:28.430,1:37:30.950
who might have wanted the question

1:37:30.110,1:37:33.560
whether he should have been allowed to

1:37:30.950,1:37:35.990
read I've because the margin made sure

1:37:33.560,1:37:37.820
it wasn't an issue in the end but it did

1:37:35.990,1:37:39.670
have a massive effect on his confidence

1:37:37.820,1:37:43.010
absolutely yeah

1:37:39.670,1:37:47.660
put him in contention and ask questions

1:37:43.010,1:37:51.110
of the dire and shubo he's getting all

1:37:47.660,1:37:54.620
the coverage here because of his special

1:37:51.110,1:37:57.500
place in the British consciousness he

1:37:54.620,1:38:00.170
and Jessica Ennis were the two poster

1:37:57.500,1:38:02.660
boy and girl he will feel as though he's

1:38:00.170,1:38:09.020
got his gold really by being on that

1:38:02.660,1:38:11.180
podium as David Boudia though we'll take

1:38:09.020,1:38:13.400
all the plaudits a to bow with an

1:38:11.180,1:38:14.630
Olympic silver medal almost feeling like

1:38:13.400,1:38:17.670
they forgot man in all these

1:38:14.630,1:38:19.710
celebrations yes

1:38:17.670,1:38:21.270
I think the weight of expectation was

1:38:19.710,1:38:23.370
well and truly on his shoulders and he

1:38:21.270,1:38:27.900
and he simply didn't dive quite as well

1:38:23.370,1:38:29.429
as he did in the semies it's about

1:38:27.900,1:38:31.170
delivering when the medals are on offer

1:38:29.429,1:38:34.790
those earlier scores of course don't

1:38:31.170,1:38:38.390
carry forward to the final and the dyer

1:38:34.790,1:38:43.880
saves his best when it matters

1:38:38.390,1:38:43.880
bronze on a silver his Hall from these

1:38:44.030,1:38:49.080
Olympic Games the world championships

1:38:46.620,1:38:53.540
are in Barcelona for swimming next year

1:38:49.080,1:38:57.840
when these divers will recon grenades

1:38:53.540,1:39:00.239
they will have to be righter their very

1:38:57.840,1:39:03.210
best to match a show like this but it's

1:39:00.239,1:39:06.050
that Olympic title that is the big one

1:39:03.210,1:39:09.060
that's what makes you a diving immortal

1:39:06.050,1:39:11.910
so we won't be far away from a medal

1:39:09.060,1:39:15.440
presentation and nearly everyone is

1:39:11.910,1:39:17.969
staying for it and so are we

1:39:15.440,1:39:20.130
I've been impressed with the way crowds

1:39:17.969,1:39:21.840
have stayed you know the extra extra

1:39:20.130,1:39:24.060
minutes - even if there's been no

1:39:21.840,1:39:26.280
British competitor on that on the day I

1:39:24.060,1:39:27.690
did a lot of sessions of gymnastics and

1:39:26.280,1:39:30.239
observed that that was the case every

1:39:27.690,1:39:32.580
time and that makes a difference to the

1:39:30.239,1:39:34.830
athletes Roger well the pool has to be

1:39:32.580,1:39:37.170
said was hopelessly one-sided in its

1:39:34.830,1:39:39.000
support but within that there was still

1:39:37.170,1:39:41.550
a full emotional range throughout the

1:39:39.000,1:39:44.000
three sessions of the diving for those

1:39:41.550,1:39:47.850
divers who really performed brilliantly

1:39:44.000,1:39:49.410
and those who may be disappointed once

1:39:47.850,1:39:51.719
got to say that those are slightly

1:39:49.410,1:39:54.390
disappointing marks for the top guys in

1:39:51.719,1:39:56.340
the last round or two were fairly

1:39:54.390,1:39:58.400
enthusiastically received by the crowd

1:39:56.340,1:40:02.250
but in general the atmosphere has been

1:39:58.400,1:40:06.230
very special and it's another successful

1:40:02.250,1:40:10.110
competition in these London 2012 games

1:40:06.230,1:40:11.790
walking to the Aquatic Centre across the

1:40:10.110,1:40:13.650
Olympic Park past the stadium this

1:40:11.790,1:40:15.750
evening the atmosphere around it was a

1:40:13.650,1:40:17.730
glorious summer's evening and you can't

1:40:15.750,1:40:19.560
always say that in Stratford even in

1:40:17.730,1:40:22.110
August and the atmosphere was great

1:40:19.560,1:40:23.940
every different country was mixing there

1:40:22.110,1:40:26.130
were loads of Dutch fans going to see

1:40:23.940,1:40:28.260
the hockey everybody's streaming there

1:40:26.130,1:40:30.480
with their colours and the atmosphere

1:40:28.260,1:40:32.970
was absolutely special as it has been

1:40:30.480,1:40:34.200
about two weeks and for everybody lucky

1:40:32.970,1:40:37.080
enough to get a ticket in here tonight

1:40:34.200,1:40:38.880
then this competition and the drama and

1:40:37.080,1:40:41.190
the excitement of it all and a happy

1:40:38.880,1:40:45.480
enough ending for the crowd has really

1:40:41.190,1:40:46.920
topped it off and that's special yeah

1:40:45.480,1:40:48.630
and when you enjoy an evening like

1:40:46.920,1:40:51.360
tonight outside especially as you say

1:40:48.630,1:40:53.850
Roger you realize you just blow away all

1:40:51.360,1:40:55.739
your cynicism about the Olympics

1:40:53.850,1:40:57.750
whatever that those cynicism might be

1:40:55.739,1:41:00.060
and rejoice in the human spirit that's

1:40:57.750,1:41:02.400
it and the goodness that's out there and

1:41:00.060,1:41:04.739
the happiness that it generates on a

1:41:02.400,1:41:09.570
night like tonight when it's just great

1:41:04.739,1:41:11.520
fun to be around Olympic Park this is

1:41:09.570,1:41:13.290
what it's all about and when you bring

1:41:11.520,1:41:15.030
an olympics to a city you hope to

1:41:13.290,1:41:17.850
capture that and it's it's been done

1:41:15.030,1:41:20.250
here that's for sure and and a big

1:41:17.850,1:41:22.590
contributor to that every time when it

1:41:20.250,1:41:24.989
works is the volunteers the quality and

1:41:22.590,1:41:26.580
the attitude of the volunteer zone I've

1:41:24.989,1:41:28.370
been really impressed and I've been

1:41:26.580,1:41:30.720
lucky enough to attend six Olympics and

1:41:28.370,1:41:32.970
no one's done it better than here in

1:41:30.720,1:41:36.239
terms of making everyone from overseas

1:41:32.970,1:41:37.680
and locally feel so welcome well that's

1:41:36.239,1:41:40.170
terrific to hear I've been around a

1:41:37.680,1:41:42.390
quite a few different events during the

1:41:40.170,1:41:44.870
last two weeks not all have been gold

1:41:42.390,1:41:48.090
medal events but of weightlifting and

1:41:44.870,1:41:50.310
rowing a real range of sports handball

1:41:48.090,1:41:52.980
even an arena has been packed out and

1:41:50.310,1:41:54.780
the board is turning up watching sports

1:41:52.980,1:41:57.690
they know nothing about and people they

1:41:54.780,1:41:59.700
know nothing about and paying quite a

1:41:57.690,1:42:01.200
bit of money for it and just being

1:41:59.700,1:42:03.000
delighted to be there and be a part of

1:42:01.200,1:42:05.310
it if you're just joining us we're

1:42:03.000,1:42:07.770
awaiting the middle presentation for the

1:42:05.310,1:42:12.260
10-meter platform a quite sensational

1:42:07.770,1:42:12.260
evening of competition

1:42:14.829,1:42:20.389
tinged with a little bit of drama and

1:42:17.419,1:42:23.300
sadness for the injury to Martin Wolfram

1:42:20.389,1:42:28.309
whether what we suspect was a shoulder

1:42:23.300,1:42:30.260
dislocation on his last dive the word

1:42:28.309,1:42:32.419
about the Chinese divers as well because

1:42:30.260,1:42:34.610
the standards they've set and the way

1:42:32.419,1:42:37.249
that they have hauled the sport for

1:42:34.610,1:42:39.139
words with their exemplary performances

1:42:37.249,1:42:41.179
in no way is it decrying their efforts

1:42:39.139,1:42:43.219
because people are almost celebrating

1:42:41.179,1:42:45.349
are they being beaten it's a it is a

1:42:43.219,1:42:47.780
backhanded compliment in that way but

1:42:45.349,1:42:50.479
they've set their standards so high but

1:42:47.780,1:42:53.749
it does prove that nobody wins all the

1:42:50.479,1:42:56.599
time every time and what it proves to is

1:42:53.749,1:42:58.489
it in the last round pressure puts a

1:42:56.599,1:43:02.479
microscope bar on your ability to cope

1:42:58.489,1:43:04.999
with what's happening and sometimes you

1:43:02.479,1:43:08.209
can just expose a weakness that maybe

1:43:04.999,1:43:09.619
you can deal with in years to come when

1:43:08.209,1:43:11.959
once you've had the experience of

1:43:09.619,1:43:13.760
dealing with it I think that's what

1:43:11.959,1:43:15.979
David padorin particularly did because

1:43:13.760,1:43:18.709
he was following Tom Daley the crowd

1:43:15.979,1:43:21.019
were really up he was the Chinese were

1:43:18.709,1:43:24.320
next and he always seemed to respond and

1:43:21.019,1:43:27.829
kept that pressure on the two Chinese

1:43:24.320,1:43:31.159
divers and to some extent to different

1:43:27.829,1:43:35.119
extents they did crack now we're ready

1:43:31.159,1:43:38.689
for that victory ceremony which will be

1:43:35.119,1:43:41.239
raucously supported from all quarters

1:43:38.689,1:43:43.449
they are really going to enjoy the next

1:43:41.239,1:43:43.449
10 minutes

1:43:52.060,1:43:58.150
we've got two very happy men and a

1:43:54.790,1:44:00.580
slightly disconsolate chuubo you really

1:43:58.150,1:44:04.360
expected to win his country expected him

1:44:00.580,1:44:09.850
to but any competitor should be proud

1:44:04.360,1:44:12.130
and pleased to receive silver he feeling

1:44:09.850,1:44:19.140
Burton golden bronze nobody gonna enjoy

1:44:12.130,1:44:19.140
this we use our Ching

1:44:26.880,1:44:34.739
and he was vice president of the Beijing

1:44:31.180,1:44:37.000
Games Organising Committee for six years

1:44:34.739,1:44:39.010
he might just have been expecting to

1:44:37.000,1:44:41.550
present a gold medal to one of his

1:44:39.010,1:44:41.550
countrymen

1:44:45.310,1:44:53.200
president of FINA but the Julio says our

1:44:48.160,1:44:57.880
malli own a Ruiz from Uruguay presents

1:44:53.200,1:45:04.140
the flowers Tom Bailey cough and get up

1:44:57.880,1:45:08.040
on that platform quick enough the first

1:45:04.140,1:45:12.990
Tim meter medal for Great Britain since

1:45:08.040,1:45:12.990
1960 52 years just listen to this

1:45:20.030,1:45:24.290
every mum throughout the land to be

1:45:22.370,1:45:28.340
saying our blessing weren't they

1:45:24.290,1:45:32.230
yeah that that's a smile that you'll see

1:45:28.340,1:45:32.230
across newspapers across the world

1:45:33.430,1:45:39.440
you've got to be a hard man not to

1:45:37.390,1:45:40.850
really have your heart go out to him

1:45:39.440,1:45:42.980
what he's been through and he'll be

1:45:40.850,1:45:49.670
thinking of his late father in this

1:45:42.980,1:45:51.020
moment I'm absolutely sure gonna be one

1:45:49.670,1:45:53.630
of the happiest prawns medals of the

1:45:51.020,1:45:54.890
games I think so and you could see the

1:45:53.630,1:45:56.570
digestion to the crowd that he's saying

1:45:54.890,1:46:02.440
yes you know thank you for your support

1:45:56.570,1:46:06.380
this is for you too for to bow more

1:46:02.440,1:46:09.370
dazzling skills but just for once the

1:46:06.380,1:46:14.060
world champion has to miss out

1:46:09.370,1:46:14.060
[Applause]

1:46:15.610,1:46:20.409
now let's see the unpredictability of

1:46:17.739,1:46:26.469
sport the hottest of favourites coming

1:46:20.409,1:46:32.260
in but he didn't reckon perhaps on the

1:46:26.469,1:46:35.500
performance David Boudia the jerseys

1:46:32.260,1:46:38.050
moment which is standing evenings

1:46:35.500,1:46:40.809
competition and a bit of a smile at last

1:46:38.050,1:46:44.400
from the 19 year old and the gracious

1:46:40.809,1:46:48.250
bow from all the Chinese divers as ever

1:46:44.400,1:46:51.489
but it takes a a great diver to win a

1:46:48.250,1:46:53.500
great competition and the gold medallist

1:46:51.489,1:46:57.070
is from the United States the good days

1:46:53.500,1:47:00.900
are rolling again for diving in the

1:46:57.070,1:47:00.900
state David Boudia wins the gold

1:47:06.389,1:47:11.260
to think that less than two tenths of a

1:47:09.010,1:47:13.710
point separated that the top three

1:47:11.260,1:47:16.570
divers coming into that last round he

1:47:13.710,1:47:20.369
held his nerve he pulled out a one

1:47:16.570,1:47:22.809
hundred and two point six to win it and

1:47:20.369,1:47:25.719
to win it by a couple of points well

1:47:22.809,1:47:28.809
done David and his experience having

1:47:25.719,1:47:31.599
been to a games before maybe that helped

1:47:28.809,1:47:35.789
him and we'll say it one final time he

1:47:31.599,1:47:35.789
nearly didn't even make the semi-final

1:47:56.830,1:48:05.199
[Music]

1:48:07.810,1:48:11.669
[Music]

1:48:14.250,1:48:24.320
[Music]

1:48:28.100,1:48:31.149
[Music]

1:48:35.130,1:48:58.520
[Music]

1:49:03.410,1:49:10.590
you can hardly believe it I just want to

1:49:08.310,1:49:13.980
shoot you the ranking of where he was

1:49:10.590,1:49:17.040
after each series of dives equal first

1:49:13.980,1:49:20.100
after the first equal third first first

1:49:17.040,1:49:22.500
equals second and first he was the most

1:49:20.100,1:49:24.540
consistent man who talked about quality

1:49:22.500,1:49:28.170
and consistency at the start David

1:49:24.540,1:49:31.500
Boudia delivered it and he's being

1:49:28.170,1:49:33.420
delivered a gold medal nobody's coming

1:49:31.500,1:49:39.930
nobody's come to the early bus have a

1:49:33.420,1:49:42.360
note to bow was only in front after the

1:49:39.930,1:49:45.900
second series of dives equal fourth

1:49:42.360,1:49:49.790
after the first thin first second second

1:49:45.900,1:49:52.430
second second never quite cracked it

1:49:49.790,1:49:54.990
they were posed for the photographs now

1:49:52.430,1:49:56.910
and enjoy the moment

1:49:54.990,1:49:58.580
I think Tom Daley's going to do his own

1:49:56.910,1:50:01.890
victory lap in front of all these

1:49:58.580,1:50:04.020
supporters now they can take their

1:50:01.890,1:50:08.160
photographs and use their flash guns as

1:50:04.020,1:50:09.010
much as they want now he's going up into

1:50:08.160,1:50:15.079
the crowd there

1:50:09.010,1:50:15.079
[Applause]

1:50:15.580,1:50:21.810
it's gonna make the most of this moment

1:50:19.410,1:50:26.010
tried to steal the show David Boudia

1:50:21.810,1:50:28.200
doesn't mind he's got the gold they're

1:50:26.010,1:50:30.210
really supposed to march around together

1:50:28.200,1:50:31.560
so that the photographers can get the

1:50:30.210,1:50:35.430
shot of the three of them together but

1:50:31.560,1:50:40.440
David Boudia has been thrown the Stars

1:50:35.430,1:50:42.060
and Stripes that's all good we're nearly

1:50:40.440,1:50:46.020
at the end of the journey at me Rajan is

1:50:42.060,1:50:48.390
a sense of almost melancholy and sadness

1:50:46.020,1:50:51.570
that the this great party is coming to

1:50:48.390,1:50:57.960
an end they're going to celebrate as

1:50:51.570,1:51:01.670
well there is a great camaraderie

1:50:57.960,1:51:01.670
one senses between the divers

1:51:03.400,1:51:09.250
[Applause]

1:51:06.349,1:51:11.750
great staff just enjoy these scenes

1:51:09.250,1:51:19.570
moments to cherish

1:51:11.750,1:51:22.869
[Applause]

1:51:19.570,1:51:26.020
I hope to bow also realizes the party

1:51:22.869,1:51:29.050
played what a contribution he's made to

1:51:26.020,1:51:31.329
10-meter platform diving and just

1:51:29.050,1:51:34.119
throwing here - Roger that you don't get

1:51:31.329,1:51:36.340
a wonderful competition like this unless

1:51:34.119,1:51:38.290
you've got three or four guys competing

1:51:36.340,1:51:42.340
at the very top providing you with real

1:51:38.290,1:51:44.949
drama it's not really as exciting if one

1:51:42.340,1:51:47.500
man races away with it to have to bow

1:51:44.949,1:51:49.389
and Tom Daley they're pushing the dire

1:51:47.500,1:51:51.489
all the way and to get the surprise

1:51:49.389,1:51:56.230
result this is one of the great

1:51:51.489,1:51:58.000
competitions you'll see in diving you

1:51:56.230,1:52:02.170
need more than one man to be standing up

1:51:58.000,1:52:06.280
and giving you a story so a great

1:52:02.170,1:52:08.590
competition for the United States who

1:52:06.280,1:52:10.780
got off to a good start with David

1:52:08.590,1:52:12.340
Boudia winning bronze in that 10 metre

1:52:10.780,1:52:14.260
synchro and it gave the rest of the

1:52:12.340,1:52:23.290
American diving team a bit of momentum

1:52:14.260,1:52:28.230
he started in boy has he finished it six

1:52:23.290,1:52:32.290
out of eight then for Chinese diving

1:52:28.230,1:52:34.599
three meters and 10 meters for men let

1:52:32.290,1:52:36.520
it down and when he said your standard

1:52:34.599,1:52:41.619
so high he couldn't understand

1:52:36.520,1:52:43.630
disappointment with silver but Tom Daley

1:52:41.619,1:52:45.329
pretty happy with bronze to say the

1:52:43.630,1:52:47.409
least

1:52:45.329,1:52:50.290
well the blow torch of Olympic

1:52:47.409,1:52:54.820
competition shows the strengths and

1:52:50.290,1:52:57.520
frailties of the athlete I saw all of

1:52:54.820,1:52:59.619
that tonight and we would come away with

1:52:57.520,1:53:02.739
a wonderful feeling about the health of

1:52:59.619,1:53:04.990
the sport the competitors who give us

1:53:02.739,1:53:08.260
the pleasure from it

1:53:04.990,1:53:10.810
just delighted to have been here States

1:53:08.260,1:53:14.950
got a silver in the women's three metre

1:53:10.810,1:53:17.290
synchro and a couple of bronze in the

1:53:14.950,1:53:20.170
men's three metre synchro as well and

1:53:17.290,1:53:23.890
it's and you may comes to the Brian

1:53:20.170,1:53:25.630
getting that women's silver so a gold

1:53:23.890,1:53:28.570
silver and two bronze for the United

1:53:25.630,1:53:30.520
States well this party's going to carry

1:53:28.570,1:53:32.500
on for quite some time Steve thank you

1:53:30.520,1:53:35.280
very much for your contribution as we

1:53:32.500,1:53:38.110
confirm the final result and some

1:53:35.280,1:53:38.410
dazzling statistical work if I might say

1:53:38.110,1:53:40.750
so

1:53:38.410,1:53:43.300
for an artistic sport you can certainly

1:53:40.750,1:53:45.070
crunch a few numbers well the statistics

1:53:43.300,1:53:47.680
are also important out there when you're

1:53:45.070,1:53:50.500
looking at degrees of difficulty and in

1:53:47.680,1:53:52.540
execution the number that really matters

1:53:50.500,1:53:53.190
is the mess on top at the end and David

1:53:52.540,1:53:56.860
Boudia

1:53:53.190,1:53:58.870
particularly with that 102 last dive to

1:53:56.860,1:54:02.650
produce that under pressure reminiscent

1:53:58.870,1:54:07.930
in some ways of the finishing in Beijing

1:54:02.650,1:54:09.640
four years ago remember some of those

1:54:07.930,1:54:11.860
names down the bottom end just teenagers

1:54:09.640,1:54:15.670
in their first Olympic Games they will

1:54:11.860,1:54:20.890
be competing that the standard is set so

1:54:15.670,1:54:24.400
high now the end of a couple of

1:54:20.890,1:54:30.490
astonishing weeks of great competition

1:54:24.400,1:54:32.710
in this Aquatic Center 17,000 capacity

1:54:30.490,1:54:34.720
and boy they all had their money's worth

1:54:32.710,1:54:39.310
a great competition here in the 10-meter

1:54:34.720,1:54:41.080
platform diving and I think there's a

1:54:39.310,1:54:45.330
bit of a party going to be happening in

1:54:41.080,1:54:48.100
the United States camp and also in the

1:54:45.330,1:54:51.040
British camp if you're scared of heights

1:54:48.100,1:54:54.270
look away now as we take you to the edge

1:54:51.040,1:54:59.620
of the platform and consider what the

1:54:54.270,1:55:01.630
competitors head six times over before

1:54:59.620,1:55:03.430
you worry that is an automatic suspended

1:55:01.630,1:55:05.680
camera there's not some poor chap

1:55:03.430,1:55:09.880
holding that one but again just to recap

1:55:05.680,1:55:13.210
here it was an American gold a Chinese

1:55:09.880,1:55:14.610
silver and a very British bronze here in

1:55:13.210,1:55:16.800
the 10-meter platform

1:55:14.610,1:55:18.690
maybe just to enjoy these final few

1:55:16.800,1:55:20.910
memories from this great night of

1:55:18.690,1:55:23.300
competition and certainly hope you've

1:55:20.910,1:55:23.300
enjoyed it

1:55:23.770,1:55:27.089
[Music]

1:55:31.120,1:55:35.200
how to remember at all I'm sure you'll

1:55:33.310,1:55:38.740
remember some of it and especially the

1:55:35.200,1:55:42.520
end and the joy of victory for birdie

1:55:38.740,1:55:46.270
and bronze for daily a great night off

1:55:42.520,1:55:49.620
the platform was the game just our

1:55:46.270,1:55:49.620
pleasure to bring it to you
