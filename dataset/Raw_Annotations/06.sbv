on the 2012 London Olympics and welcome

to the final of the women's 10 metre

0:00:05.879,0:00:12.210
platform we had a rather edgy prelims

0:00:09.750,0:00:15.299
slightly better semi-final earlier today

0:00:12.210,0:00:19.520
and hopefully we will be on course for

0:00:15.299,0:00:22.980
an exemplary 10 meter final tonight

0:00:19.520,0:00:27.150
Yulia go got Chuck just getting in in

0:00:22.980,0:00:28.740
12th place all of these dives including

0:00:27.150,0:00:30.240
this lady in particular looking to do a

0:00:28.740,0:00:33.140
great deal better tonight bronze

0:00:30.240,0:00:36.870
medalist from last year at - Paolo

0:00:33.140,0:00:40.050
Sanchez Espinosa Sanchez she's built on

0:00:36.870,0:00:46.920
the screen no me bat key of Italy will

0:00:40.050,0:00:48.930
be after her and who you Dan may be

0:00:46.920,0:00:50.610
somewhat surprised see a Chinese diver

0:00:48.930,0:00:52.829
so far down the pecking order hasn't

0:00:50.610,0:00:55.649
really gone into gear either in the

0:00:52.829,0:00:59.120
prelims on the semi swishes in there as

0:00:55.649,0:01:02.000
indeed is Roslin finial a much better

0:00:59.120,0:01:06.930
semi-final and she did preliminary

0:01:02.000,0:01:08.130
Christians Joe has had a low degree of

0:01:06.930,0:01:10.170
difficulty in her program

0:01:08.130,0:01:12.540
let's work to her benefit doesn't always

0:01:10.170,0:01:14.790
go for the big numbers make sure she has

0:01:12.540,0:01:19.470
been consistent as has yulia coulton

0:01:14.790,0:01:21.869
over russia now on to the big hitters

0:01:19.470,0:01:26.369
right at the top of the pile and after

0:01:21.869,0:01:28.979
both the prelims and the semi-final and

0:01:26.369,0:01:30.810
to the bank now that's a word the to

0:01:28.979,0:01:33.509
America to Australians I should say

0:01:30.810,0:01:36.180
together and they will be following one

0:01:33.509,0:01:40.259
another in the competition tonight very

0:01:36.180,0:01:46.500
impressive was this young lady 16 years

0:01:40.259,0:01:49.860
of age on to the second ranked after the

0:01:46.500,0:01:53.000
semi-final making bent feet oh but you

0:01:49.860,0:01:55.140
have to say head and shoulders and

0:01:53.000,0:01:56.850
virtually all of a torso ahead of

0:01:55.140,0:01:58.680
everybody else on the basis of what we

0:01:56.850,0:02:01.829
saw this morning and indeed last night

0:01:58.680,0:02:05.189
in the preliminaries is the top ranked

0:02:01.829,0:02:07.049
of the Chinese defending champion chain

0:02:05.189,0:02:08.489
rule in well we're just about ready to

0:02:07.049,0:02:10.229
go but of course the competition cannot

0:02:08.489,0:02:12.660
start we can't get this party started

0:02:10.229,0:02:13.620
without one very special addition to the

0:02:12.660,0:02:16.739
guest list

0:02:13.620,0:02:17.220
Leon Taylor good evening sir thank you

0:02:16.739,0:02:19.760
Bob

0:02:17.220,0:02:23.730
well there there it is there is the

0:02:19.760,0:02:25.590
10-meter platform towering above all the

0:02:23.730,0:02:29.849
other diving boards very very close to

0:02:25.590,0:02:32.730
this ceiling and we have finally the

0:02:29.849,0:02:35.909
finalists here now it's been well

0:02:32.730,0:02:38.579
fair-to-middling I would say so far

0:02:35.909,0:02:41.370
generally speaking the polymer EES were

0:02:38.579,0:02:43.470
full of mishaps and mix ups and the semi

0:02:41.370,0:02:46.290
finals weren't actually much better so

0:02:43.470,0:02:48.799
we finally got there we have 12 divers

0:02:46.290,0:02:52.440
each of the divers will perform five

0:02:48.799,0:02:54.540
optional dives so these are the most

0:02:52.440,0:02:59.310
difficult dives that these girls can

0:02:54.540,0:03:01.290
perform the total from each dive is

0:02:59.310,0:03:03.840
obviously added to the next into the

0:03:01.290,0:03:06.090
next so the sequence if score decides

0:03:03.840,0:03:08.250
the places and as Bob's already

0:03:06.090,0:03:11.519
mentioned there is one person who is a

0:03:08.250,0:03:13.680
cut above that is the Beijing Olympic

0:03:11.519,0:03:17.720
champion at only 15 years old now she's

0:03:13.680,0:03:20.910
the grand old age of 19 and she is well

0:03:17.720,0:03:23.730
miles in front like she already

0:03:20.910,0:03:25.739
qualified for the final after round four

0:03:23.730,0:03:28.380
she did not even need to perform her

0:03:25.739,0:03:30.660
last dive that is how good this young

0:03:28.380,0:03:32.700
lady is then there's you you Dan now she

0:03:30.660,0:03:35.160
is suffering I'm not sure whether she's

0:03:32.700,0:03:37.260
injured no one seems to know but she is

0:03:35.160,0:03:37.620
off her game heading into their hot tub

0:03:37.260,0:03:39.180
there

0:03:37.620,0:03:41.579
the divers tend to pop in and out of

0:03:39.180,0:03:43.440
that just to keep the muscles warm in

0:03:41.579,0:03:45.180
between dives obviously they dive in a

0:03:43.440,0:03:46.769
sequence in an order and that water

0:03:45.180,0:03:48.720
stays the same throughout those handling

0:03:46.769,0:03:51.329
I'm think that she could be on four

0:03:48.720,0:03:53.579
medal the 19-year old for Malaysia nice

0:03:51.329,0:03:55.949
outfit she's been looking really solid

0:03:53.579,0:03:58.019
and she looks really relaxed there's the

0:03:55.949,0:04:02.430
coaching Corral keep them all penned in

0:03:58.019,0:04:05.280
there as if they were sheep in their

0:04:02.430,0:04:07.109
shoes she's 16 from Australia now if I

0:04:05.280,0:04:08.549
was allowed to bet I'd be betting on

0:04:07.109,0:04:10.680
this young lady for a medal

0:04:08.549,0:04:11.819
she is well come from strength to

0:04:10.680,0:04:13.560
strength to strength there's Paul

0:04:11.819,0:04:16.530
Espinoza way off the pace in the prelims

0:04:13.560,0:04:18.359
and semi now can she ride that Mexican

0:04:16.530,0:04:21.659
high that they've been on in the diving

0:04:18.359,0:04:23.150
pool no question about the young

0:04:21.659,0:04:25.340
Australians going back to her

0:04:23.150,0:04:27.590
on round four dive I think on both

0:04:25.340,0:04:29.900
occasions she's not dropped it exactly

0:04:27.590,0:04:32.389
but she hasn't done very well so 1 2 3 &

0:04:29.900,0:04:32.870
5 look great it's round 4 that could do

0:04:32.389,0:04:35.000
for her

0:04:32.870,0:04:36.289
yep what he said yeah well it could go

0:04:35.000,0:04:38.720
either way he couldn't it we will tee

0:04:36.289,0:04:40.880
that one up when it comes the first time

0:04:38.720,0:04:43.280
we're just making her way up to the

0:04:40.880,0:04:44.750
10-meter board there 5 dives they all go

0:04:43.280,0:04:47.660
in different directions five different

0:04:44.750,0:04:49.550
dives from the six available groups of

0:04:47.660,0:04:52.580
dive from the platform so that's

0:04:49.550,0:04:53.870
forwards and backwards inwards which is

0:04:52.580,0:04:56.120
where you stand backwards and spin

0:04:53.870,0:04:57.380
forwards towards the diving board the

0:04:56.120,0:04:59.240
reverse which is where you stand

0:04:57.380,0:05:00.919
forwards and jump away spinning

0:04:59.240,0:05:02.810
backwards towards the diving board and

0:05:00.919,0:05:05.419
the twist which is where you rotate

0:05:02.810,0:05:08.030
longitudinally as well and also the arm

0:05:05.419,0:05:10.010
stand group so five dives out of those

0:05:08.030,0:05:12.440
six groups so you'll see lots of

0:05:10.010,0:05:14.750
different dives at different times but

0:05:12.440,0:05:15.289
and we can explain a little more as we

0:05:14.750,0:05:18.770
go along

0:05:15.289,0:05:21.199
and the final gets underway well I can't

0:05:18.770,0:05:23.870
explain for you in terms of the dives in

0:05:21.199,0:05:27.050
the first round you will see nine out of

0:05:23.870,0:05:30.410
the 12 divers go for a Ford three and a

0:05:27.050,0:05:32.599
half with difficulty of 3.0 and the pike

0:05:30.410,0:05:34.960
position the first five and nine out of

0:05:32.599,0:05:38.180
twelve will do this particular dive

0:05:34.960,0:05:38.659
including the opening diver julia row up

0:05:38.180,0:05:41.590
Chuck

0:05:38.659,0:05:41.590
of Ukraine

0:05:43.159,0:05:49.459
get in this contest underway it's more

0:05:47.149,0:05:52.639
the audience is filling up as we speak

0:05:49.459,0:05:55.429
very busy Olympic Park I'm sure most of

0:05:52.639,0:05:56.869
the seats will be taken so first diver

0:05:55.429,0:05:58.759
the pike shape they're letting her down

0:05:56.869,0:06:00.319
a little bit she needs to be tighter in

0:05:58.759,0:06:02.539
a Pike shape so the chest should be flat

0:06:00.319,0:06:04.249
on the legs she chooses not to hold

0:06:02.539,0:06:06.919
around the back of the thighs and Link

0:06:04.249,0:06:08.569
you know hand to elbow which is what a

0:06:06.919,0:06:10.539
lot of the divers do it's a peculiar

0:06:08.569,0:06:13.189
technique she does a good job though

0:06:10.539,0:06:16.490
well I see opening gambit from her

0:06:13.189,0:06:20.599
seventeen point five zero four product

0:06:16.490,0:06:22.819
chuck of ukraine as i mentioned you'll

0:06:20.599,0:06:26.869
see that dive performed pretty much by

0:06:22.819,0:06:28.249
all of the divers in the first round all

0:06:26.869,0:06:31.610
I would say about this lady and so she

0:06:28.249,0:06:37.550
gets going is Paolo Espinosa Sanchez of

0:06:31.610,0:06:39.889
Mexico well that's much better than the

0:06:37.550,0:06:42.860
prelims much better than the semi-final

0:06:39.889,0:06:45.769
has Paola finally woken up whatever

0:06:42.860,0:06:49.039
she's had to do this afternoon but she

0:06:45.769,0:06:51.619
needs to refocus it all looks good so

0:06:49.039,0:06:53.809
far fantastic aerial work as always just

0:06:51.619,0:06:55.749
tipping over a vertical but that should

0:06:53.809,0:07:00.529
sneak a few seven and a half's and eight

0:06:55.749,0:07:03.349
it looks like a better opening dive on

0:07:00.529,0:07:05.029
the Mexican mm which way is it going to

0:07:03.349,0:07:06.159
go for this evening I was feeling

0:07:05.029,0:07:08.360
personally responsible for

0:07:06.159,0:07:09.740
underperforming both in the prelims out

0:07:08.360,0:07:12.319
of a semi so I'm just keeping my

0:07:09.740,0:07:14.300
distance and keep my counsel on what she

0:07:12.319,0:07:16.789
does here seventy point five zero says

0:07:14.300,0:07:19.309
she matches prog optic with the same

0:07:16.789,0:07:20.149
dive and he comes near me bat key of

0:07:19.309,0:07:24.319
Italy

0:07:20.149,0:07:26.689
likewise well that's the best one so far

0:07:24.319,0:07:28.729
that's the best one out of three we can

0:07:26.689,0:07:30.199
definitely compare like for like so

0:07:28.729,0:07:32.179
approaching the end of the diving board

0:07:30.199,0:07:34.789
with speed you need to turn that forward

0:07:32.179,0:07:36.740
momentum into upward momentum driving

0:07:34.789,0:07:38.269
those hips up and over squeezing into

0:07:36.740,0:07:40.969
that Pike shape that's a really good

0:07:38.269,0:07:43.219
Pike shape there was no daylight in

0:07:40.969,0:07:45.979
between the chest and the thighs look at

0:07:43.219,0:07:49.869
that beautiful dive from the Italian the

0:07:45.979,0:07:52.009
other two dives got 70.5 zero back he is

0:07:49.869,0:07:54.319
looking for a bigger score than that

0:07:52.009,0:07:56.600
same tariff different score though

0:07:54.319,0:07:58.190
seventy six point five zero remember the

0:07:56.600,0:08:00.860
Mark's with the lines through them do

0:07:58.190,0:08:04.010
not count may point fives across the

0:08:00.860,0:08:06.590
board do multiplied by the degree of

0:08:04.010,0:08:08.630
difficulty that's how you arrive at her

0:08:06.590,0:08:12.650
starting figure her first round score of

0:08:08.630,0:08:14.720
seventy six point five zero his who well

0:08:12.650,0:08:16.610
there is something wrong with this young

0:08:14.720,0:08:18.770
lady now I you know that the Chinese

0:08:16.610,0:08:20.360
keep their cards close to their chest so

0:08:18.770,0:08:22.070
no one knows whether she's injured ill

0:08:20.360,0:08:24.530
or but there's definitely something

0:08:22.070,0:08:25.400
amiss she is world silver medalist from

0:08:24.530,0:08:27.680
last year

0:08:25.400,0:08:29.690
yes she's only sixteen years old but she

0:08:27.680,0:08:31.250
was silver medalist behind the Olympic

0:08:29.690,0:08:34.130
champion last year and she is all over

0:08:31.250,0:08:36.349
the shop again so this means the medals

0:08:34.130,0:08:38.840
are wide open if you done continues to

0:08:36.349,0:08:41.210
dive like this she will be miles off the

0:08:38.840,0:08:44.420
pace this is interesting yeah she's only

0:08:41.210,0:08:47.740
had really one dive of caliber equality

0:08:44.420,0:08:52.190
this morning and likewise last night and

0:08:47.740,0:08:53.810
coach just giving her stare a few

0:08:52.190,0:08:58.010
well-chosen words by the looks of things

0:08:53.810,0:09:01.820
as we move on to Rosaline Finney on our

0:08:58.010,0:09:04.370
candidate same dive once again ranked

0:09:01.820,0:09:08.510
eighth in the semi final you see if she

0:09:04.370,0:09:10.820
can match the net she looked a little

0:09:08.510,0:09:13.100
tired this morning and I'm not surprised

0:09:10.820,0:09:14.660
these girls finished late last night in

0:09:13.100,0:09:16.760
the polymer region had to get up early

0:09:14.660,0:09:18.830
this morning to dive in the semi-finals

0:09:16.760,0:09:20.900
Roslyn looked a little bit off her game

0:09:18.830,0:09:22.850
and this looks a better effort for her

0:09:20.900,0:09:27.650
it's only gonna get sevens throwing up a

0:09:22.850,0:09:29.270
little bit too much splash squeezing

0:09:27.650,0:09:30.620
into the pike shape it seems to be

0:09:29.270,0:09:33.110
moving a head to the side there for some

0:09:30.620,0:09:34.970
reason but peculiar but she ended up on

0:09:33.110,0:09:37.460
her head which is where she wanted to be

0:09:34.970,0:09:39.620
now remind of course the judges do not

0:09:37.460,0:09:41.180
see the replay that you see we see

0:09:39.620,0:09:43.910
several times from different angles they

0:09:41.180,0:09:45.560
only get one look at it in real time so

0:09:43.910,0:09:47.870
and there's still nuances that early on

0:09:45.560,0:09:50.570
might point out probably not apparent

0:09:47.870,0:09:52.150
and not obvious to the judges in their

0:09:50.570,0:09:55.340
position down below

0:09:52.150,0:09:55.850
63 for filly on different diving kristen

0:09:55.340,0:09:58.610
stewart

0:09:55.850,0:10:02.950
2.8 in woods two and a half somersault

0:09:58.610,0:10:02.950
solo tariff needs to be good

0:10:05.400,0:10:10.290
well that's the best one she's done out

0:10:07.350,0:10:12.120
the three so prelims it was awful the

0:10:10.290,0:10:14.670
semi-final she stepped up and she

0:10:12.120,0:10:16.170
started with a weakness tied to put an

0:10:14.670,0:10:17.730
eighth degree of difficulty now we've

0:10:16.170,0:10:20.250
seen some girls hit their feet on this

0:10:17.730,0:10:22.200
story not too far away from the platform

0:10:20.250,0:10:24.750
it's very difficult to jump far enough

0:10:22.200,0:10:26.310
away and still complete the rotations

0:10:24.750,0:10:27.540
she's probably gonna get sevens on that

0:10:26.310,0:10:29.670
but because of the low degree of

0:10:27.540,0:10:34.380
difficulty it struggled to get over 60

0:10:29.670,0:10:37.290
points yeah just struggling past the 60

0:10:34.380,0:10:41.370
barrier 60 points to 0 for Christine

0:10:37.290,0:10:46.940
step just rushed back to turn the gas

0:10:41.370,0:10:49.500
off now into yulia coulton over and

0:10:46.940,0:10:53.130
there is only one arm stand in the first

0:10:49.500,0:10:56.130
round semi that can beat a regular pace

0:10:53.130,0:10:58.140
for a change crowd ooh haven't seen this

0:10:56.130,0:10:59.940
before doing an re already on the arm

0:10:58.140,0:11:01.850
stand forward double somersault one

0:10:59.940,0:11:04.020
twist

0:11:01.850,0:11:05.850
she started beautifully in the

0:11:04.020,0:11:08.760
semi-final with this dive that one there

0:11:05.850,0:11:10.620
she's just overcooked it giving it a

0:11:08.760,0:11:12.150
little bit too much on the start meant

0:11:10.620,0:11:14.760
that it was very difficult to control

0:11:12.150,0:11:16.709
with that much rotation so bending at

0:11:14.760,0:11:18.750
the arms flicking off very much like a

0:11:16.709,0:11:21.180
gymnastics vault wrapping into the twist

0:11:18.750,0:11:24.000
there we are just over rotating as she

0:11:21.180,0:11:26.580
goes in there maybe seven and a half on

0:11:24.000,0:11:28.140
that it's a real shame because it's very

0:11:26.580,0:11:30.600
confident to open with the arm stands

0:11:28.140,0:11:32.700
that takes some nerves to no control of

0:11:30.600,0:11:35.010
your nerves I should say take some nerve

0:11:32.700,0:11:36.720
well seventy two point eight five is

0:11:35.010,0:11:38.520
what she has accrued from that everybody

0:11:36.720,0:11:40.620
else who costing an arm stand most of

0:11:38.520,0:11:42.690
them and little later on pretty much all

0:11:40.620,0:11:44.370
in the third round so she opens her

0:11:42.690,0:11:46.890
program with an arm stand which

0:11:44.370,0:11:52.580
currently puts her in second place

0:11:46.890,0:11:57.570
behind the Italian bat key was the

0:11:52.580,0:12:02.070
Malaysian pang back we go to the for

0:11:57.570,0:12:04.200
three and a half again with Pike whoa is

0:12:02.070,0:12:06.330
she feeling the pressure she's been

0:12:04.200,0:12:07.830
performing very well and she's got

0:12:06.330,0:12:09.180
herself in the business end of the field

0:12:07.830,0:12:13.230
through her performance in the

0:12:09.180,0:12:15.570
semi-final only 19 years old really like

0:12:13.230,0:12:17.130
a diving superb flexibility look at that

0:12:15.570,0:12:20.310
her toes is that

0:12:17.130,0:12:22.740
nose is almost touching her ankles her

0:12:20.310,0:12:24.899
flexibility is that good however she's

0:12:22.740,0:12:26.459
let the dive go over which means it's

0:12:24.899,0:12:28.920
your struggle to get more than six is

0:12:26.459,0:12:32.700
six and a half on that and she's off the

0:12:28.920,0:12:35.940
pace start that she had in either the

0:12:32.700,0:12:38.010
prelims all the semis little bit of

0:12:35.940,0:12:42.420
reparation work already to be done the

0:12:38.010,0:12:44.970
four and a pang of Malaysia on to the

0:12:42.420,0:12:47.850
two Australians now again a four three

0:12:44.970,0:12:53.100
and a half for the slightly older of the

0:12:47.850,0:12:55.560
two Aussies Melissa would more very

0:12:53.100,0:12:58.110
smooth beautiful entry what the judges

0:12:55.560,0:13:00.420
are looking for is a vertical entry with

0:12:58.110,0:13:02.070
absolutely no splash in Melissa rube

0:13:00.420,0:13:04.589
who is bang on the money with that when

0:13:02.070,0:13:06.180
her opening dive you've seen this before

0:13:04.589,0:13:08.730
lots of the girls opening with this one

0:13:06.180,0:13:10.829
seems to be a very popular choice it's

0:13:08.730,0:13:13.800
3.0 she's going to get eight in the

0:13:10.829,0:13:16.440
house for sure on that one just what the

0:13:13.800,0:13:19.230
judges are looking for she's up the game

0:13:16.440,0:13:22.019
she's moved the bar upwards Wow

0:13:19.230,0:13:23.339
78 and disappeared without a trace into

0:13:22.019,0:13:24.810
the water that's what you want to see

0:13:23.339,0:13:28.680
and that's what she wanted to do and she

0:13:24.810,0:13:32.399
has achieved that with great alacrity

0:13:28.680,0:13:34.860
Melissa woo good start for her 78 puts

0:13:32.399,0:13:37.680
her into a lead coach still not happy

0:13:34.860,0:13:39.570
they never are from the 20 year old

0:13:37.680,0:13:42.510
Australian to the 16 year old Australian

0:13:39.570,0:13:43.890
Brittany Broman 2.7 low degree of

0:13:42.510,0:13:47.329
difficulty to start off with it's a

0:13:43.890,0:13:47.329
reverse two and a half somersaults

0:13:49.230,0:13:55.200
or she's played just a little bit safe

0:13:52.980,0:13:58.260
what a shame because this was an

0:13:55.200,0:14:00.240
absolute corker in the semi-finals

0:13:58.260,0:14:02.550
it had nines written all over it this

0:14:00.240,0:14:04.650
one all the way until the water and she

0:14:02.550,0:14:06.720
just keeps her chin in a little bit she

0:14:04.650,0:14:09.060
didn't look back enough in order to get

0:14:06.720,0:14:10.530
it right into the vertical position we

0:14:09.060,0:14:12.630
all just needed to pull back a little

0:14:10.530,0:14:14.940
bit she's gonna get seven and a half but

0:14:12.630,0:14:16.350
what a shame because wow she would it

0:14:14.940,0:14:17.910
needed nines it's a low degree of

0:14:16.350,0:14:20.060
difficulty this young lady's got some

0:14:17.910,0:14:23.280
work to do she's going to live up to the

0:14:20.060,0:14:27.750
well my prediction of a medal for her

0:14:23.280,0:14:30.870
come on yeah I put the mouth on poor

0:14:27.750,0:14:32.520
Mexican likewise fear you with the

0:14:30.870,0:14:34.350
Australian it would seem because that's

0:14:32.520,0:14:35.880
not the best dive by quite some way that

0:14:34.350,0:14:37.770
bro Boone has done over the last two

0:14:35.880,0:14:38.430
days on to the second half of the

0:14:37.770,0:14:40.140
Canadians

0:14:38.430,0:14:44.190
here's Megan Murphy to--again the for

0:14:40.140,0:14:46.560
three and a half oh here we go

0:14:44.190,0:14:49.830
I wondered when we would see the first

0:14:46.560,0:14:51.770
mistake archer they're showing with his

0:14:49.830,0:14:54.660
body language that that was very poor

0:14:51.770,0:14:56.040
wow I didn't expect to see a mistake of

0:14:54.660,0:14:57.900
that magnitude from this young lady

0:14:56.040,0:15:00.690
especially she's been one of the more

0:14:57.900,0:15:04.820
consistent can competitors through the

0:15:00.690,0:15:08.190
prelims and a semi which was a well

0:15:04.820,0:15:10.920
actually well what a shame not to splash

0:15:08.190,0:15:13.080
over onto her back low marks incoming

0:15:10.920,0:15:15.630
now what a shame especially as it looks

0:15:13.080,0:15:18.230
like even early stages a silver and a

0:15:15.630,0:15:20.700
bronze might be up for grabs today and

0:15:18.230,0:15:22.770
5.5 s just will not cut it

0:15:20.700,0:15:25.020
if you're looking to get into second or

0:15:22.770,0:15:29.840
third place first place surely is

0:15:25.020,0:15:33.170
secured before we even start by a chin

0:15:29.840,0:15:35.490
well that's how you should do it that's

0:15:33.170,0:15:40.620
definitely worth eight and a half and

0:15:35.490,0:15:43.620
nines superb technically very very good

0:15:40.620,0:15:46.140
pops up into that Pike shape no daylight

0:15:43.620,0:15:51.260
in-between the chest in the air at chest

0:15:46.140,0:15:51.260
and the thighs drills the entry

0:15:51.920,0:15:58.440
superb and away she goes

0:15:55.850,0:15:59.760
well the Crowley getting excited now why

0:15:58.440,0:16:02.250
are they getting excited well because

0:15:59.760,0:16:04.550
there's a 10 on the scoreboard sadly as

0:16:02.250,0:16:08.070
in previous competition it doesn't count

0:16:04.550,0:16:11.520
was it worth the 10 but a 9.5 s most

0:16:08.070,0:16:13.620
certainly do and eighty five point five

0:16:11.520,0:16:15.000
zero she's already proving she's in a

0:16:13.620,0:16:16.800
class of her own but just look at the

0:16:15.000,0:16:19.800
gap after round one she's already got a

0:16:16.800,0:16:22.830
gap of seven points over Melissa will in

0:16:19.800,0:16:26.100
second naomi backe and third yulia

0:16:22.830,0:16:28.050
coulton over in for power Espinoza

0:16:26.100,0:16:30.960
Sanchez much better start from her this

0:16:28.050,0:16:33.150
time round those are the ones in early

0:16:30.960,0:16:34.530
stages pushing for the medals I wasn't

0:16:33.150,0:16:38.370
leaving Philly are not too far away but

0:16:34.530,0:16:41.970
Megan Ben feet oak at the bottom of the

0:16:38.370,0:16:45.660
pile along with Lu you Dan mmm in 11th

0:16:41.970,0:16:47.460
place with a Chinese now coach made it

0:16:45.660,0:16:50.100
very clear exactly what she thought of

0:16:47.460,0:16:52.320
that dive she's gone away with a flea in

0:16:50.100,0:16:54.920
the rear only for round number two which

0:16:52.320,0:16:54.920
starts now

0:16:57.740,0:17:04.520
second round of the women's 10-meter

0:17:01.160,0:17:06.800
platform final already developing into a

0:17:04.520,0:17:09.350
very interesting contest not so much for

0:17:06.800,0:17:10.990
the main place but for the silver and

0:17:09.350,0:17:14.600
the bronze and there are plenty in

0:17:10.990,0:17:17.390
competition for that including you only

0:17:14.600,0:17:19.490
a pro cop shook up to three point two on

0:17:17.390,0:17:21.710
the degree of difficulty for her in with

0:17:19.490,0:17:25.610
three and a half somersaults equal fifth

0:17:21.710,0:17:31.370
after first round war she sneaks that

0:17:25.610,0:17:33.440
one in G us beautifully Wow an okay

0:17:31.370,0:17:35.450
start backed up with her one of the

0:17:33.440,0:17:36.710
highest degrees of difficulty in in with

0:17:35.450,0:17:38.180
three and a half that sees the safe

0:17:36.710,0:17:39.440
distance from the diving board some of

0:17:38.180,0:17:40.640
the girls have been coming in a little

0:17:39.440,0:17:44.240
bit too close for comfort

0:17:40.640,0:17:48.110
I think that's gonna just get over 70

0:17:44.240,0:17:51.290
points and she certainly laid a marker

0:17:48.110,0:17:53.530
down let's see what happens after this

0:17:51.290,0:17:53.530
is

0:17:53.940,0:18:01.090
7.5 for 72 complete and what's unique it

0:17:58.600,0:18:03.700
in is in the Leon Taylor drinking game

0:18:01.090,0:18:05.140
but it should be because while beginning

0:18:03.700,0:18:12.700
rather Brahms and this by the end of the

0:18:05.140,0:18:16.240
evening now on to power Espinoza Sanchez

0:18:12.700,0:18:18.040
of Mexico back three and a half summer

0:18:16.240,0:18:23.740
sports with tuck three point three the

0:18:18.040,0:18:27.370
degree of difficulty for the Mexican War

0:18:23.740,0:18:29.110
she's more on her game but still you

0:18:27.370,0:18:30.610
know I think that says it all that's

0:18:29.110,0:18:32.560
actually the Italian coach is kind of

0:18:30.610,0:18:35.470
gone well it's okay but we expect to see

0:18:32.560,0:18:37.660
more from this accomplished diver

0:18:35.470,0:18:39.820
she's got medals from everywhere already

0:18:37.660,0:18:42.340
Olympic medalist here silver medal in

0:18:39.820,0:18:45.310
the 10-meter synchro and that is good

0:18:42.340,0:18:47.200
but I was expecting to see nines at her

0:18:45.310,0:18:49.570
very best in or get seven seven point

0:18:47.200,0:18:51.760
five s going over a vertical if she goes

0:18:49.570,0:18:53.860
in the divers holding they could see

0:18:51.760,0:18:55.480
their heavy the wrists taped to help

0:18:53.860,0:18:59.010
with the impact just see the feet coming

0:18:55.480,0:19:02.710
towards us there and there's the wave

0:18:59.010,0:19:04.450
catch a wave and she did didn't really

0:19:02.710,0:19:06.970
want to produce that but seventy four

0:19:04.450,0:19:09.670
point two five is good enough to put her

0:19:06.970,0:19:11.500
into first place marginally at this

0:19:09.670,0:19:14.110
stage good start from there me backe

0:19:11.500,0:19:16.480
she's gone from a three point zero down

0:19:14.110,0:19:18.610
to a two point nine in round two Hingham

0:19:16.480,0:19:22.390
two back two and a half somersaults in

0:19:18.610,0:19:25.240
the pike position it's probably her

0:19:22.390,0:19:26.890
weakest dive in the program leaning away

0:19:25.240,0:19:28.210
from the diving board a little bit too

0:19:26.890,0:19:30.810
far there which means it's very

0:19:28.210,0:19:33.070
difficult to control the dive and

0:19:30.810,0:19:35.350
therefore when you're looking for that

0:19:33.070,0:19:38.020
precise entry vertical entry

0:19:35.350,0:19:39.670
gerrae sometimes get some drift which is

0:19:38.020,0:19:42.040
what happened there over as she goes in

0:19:39.670,0:19:43.930
throwing up a little bit of splash just

0:19:42.040,0:19:45.490
see the body tension required to hold

0:19:43.930,0:19:50.680
yourself when you're hurtling towards

0:19:45.490,0:19:52.540
the water incredible impact speeds she

0:19:50.680,0:19:55.090
holds on to it there see what the judges

0:19:52.540,0:19:57.160
think when they think seven point five

0:19:55.090,0:19:59.650
across the board in terms of marks

0:19:57.160,0:20:02.340
account sixty five point two five

0:19:59.650,0:20:04.900
remember it is a degree of difficulty

0:20:02.340,0:20:06.820
after those marks have been added up and

0:20:04.900,0:20:07.280
then multiplied gives you sixty five

0:20:06.820,0:20:10.010
point

0:20:07.280,0:20:11.810
two-five now who you dan mystery

0:20:10.010,0:20:14.420
regarding here at the moment why is she

0:20:11.810,0:20:20.270
diving so poorly was that just a blip or

0:20:14.420,0:20:22.820
not oh good night you cannot make

0:20:20.270,0:20:25.510
glaring errors like that and expect to

0:20:22.820,0:20:28.760
feature on the podium now it's wide open

0:20:25.510,0:20:30.710
for the rest of the ladies wow this is

0:20:28.760,0:20:33.890
really interesting she's a little tight

0:20:30.710,0:20:35.900
to the platform there Wow aerial work is

0:20:33.890,0:20:38.300
good she just doesn't seem to know where

0:20:35.900,0:20:40.340
she is I wonder if it'll come out after

0:20:38.300,0:20:43.010
the contest if there was anything wrong

0:20:40.340,0:20:46.340
with her from an illness point of view

0:20:43.010,0:20:51.410
or an injury because she is way off her

0:20:46.340,0:20:53.750
games like the coach doesn't want to

0:20:51.410,0:20:59.930
talk to her so wait a minute consolation

0:20:53.750,0:21:02.150
there and just get along with it and

0:20:59.930,0:21:04.010
forty three point two zero how do you

0:21:02.150,0:21:05.590
know what she said what do you speak no

0:21:04.010,0:21:08.540
I'm just looking at body language

0:21:05.590,0:21:10.130
interpretation Thank You neon Rosalie

0:21:08.540,0:21:15.590
and filly on now backward three and a

0:21:10.130,0:21:18.080
half somersaults tuck 3.30 there you go

0:21:15.590,0:21:20.180
she saved the best until the final this

0:21:18.080,0:21:22.790
young lady was way off the pace in the

0:21:20.180,0:21:25.190
prelims and in the semi-final hence her

0:21:22.790,0:21:26.360
early start position in this final this

0:21:25.190,0:21:29.300
is the dive that was giving her

0:21:26.360,0:21:32.210
difficulty she's woken up and she saved

0:21:29.300,0:21:34.580
her best back three and a half until now

0:21:32.210,0:21:35.690
this is big because you can't see where

0:21:34.580,0:21:37.040
you're going you're spinning backwards

0:21:35.690,0:21:39.260
you can only see where you've been you

0:21:37.040,0:21:44.570
have to point your feet up which he does

0:21:39.260,0:21:48.020
well spot on good work yep nods to the

0:21:44.570,0:21:50.690
coach and she can go into the punch ball

0:21:48.020,0:21:55.070
very happy that she's picked up seventy

0:21:50.690,0:21:57.290
five point nine zero that lifts up to

0:21:55.070,0:22:01.520
fourth place not that far behind the

0:21:57.290,0:22:04.700
main movers and shakers Christine step

0:22:01.520,0:22:07.250
of Germany moved up from the ranks of

0:22:04.700,0:22:11.120
the upper twos to the early threes six

0:22:07.250,0:22:12.530
six three point two try six point two

0:22:11.120,0:22:14.900
three point two back two and a half

0:22:12.530,0:22:17.630
somersaults well she's renowned for her

0:22:14.900,0:22:20.100
very clean entries what you're looking

0:22:17.630,0:22:23.940
for is a splash less entry

0:22:20.100,0:22:26.309
what Stewart is famed for a takeoff sir

0:22:23.940,0:22:28.890
very average indeed so she's quite weak

0:22:26.309,0:22:30.840
not as very dynamic or strong as some of

0:22:28.890,0:22:34.919
the other girls but she can certainly

0:22:30.840,0:22:37.530
get her dives in with hardly a riffle of

0:22:34.919,0:22:41.490
splash and that will probably get seven

0:22:37.530,0:22:43.350
and a half maybe an eighth the judges

0:22:41.490,0:22:44.820
marks and yep they're going with you on

0:22:43.350,0:22:47.700
that they're going with the eights and

0:22:44.820,0:22:51.150
giving her a total accumulative score of

0:22:47.700,0:22:54.090
seventy six point eight zero and again

0:22:51.150,0:22:58.380
she's bunching up in a quite a large

0:22:54.090,0:23:00.450
pack of seven marks surrounding five

0:22:58.380,0:23:03.510
divers at this stage that's how tight

0:23:00.450,0:23:06.500
this competition is yulia colton over

0:23:03.510,0:23:08.820
fourth after round one

0:23:06.500,0:23:10.530
just going a little bit loose in a lower

0:23:08.820,0:23:12.419
back if she went in her takeoff is a

0:23:10.530,0:23:14.400
little bit weak which means the dive is

0:23:12.419,0:23:16.770
always going to finish very very low to

0:23:14.400,0:23:19.770
the water which means that you need to

0:23:16.770,0:23:22.260
do a well a pretty good job of getting

0:23:19.770,0:23:23.520
out of it very very quickly and trying

0:23:22.260,0:23:24.929
to hide that from the judges just see

0:23:23.520,0:23:27.299
they're just turning into a bit of a

0:23:24.929,0:23:29.100
banana woman as she goes in see on the

0:23:27.299,0:23:33.419
super slow-motion arching through the

0:23:29.100,0:23:35.610
lower back yeah just needed a little bit

0:23:33.419,0:23:38.520
more speed to that rotation in order to

0:23:35.610,0:23:41.070
give herself a fraction more time it's

0:23:38.520,0:23:44.010
okay but needed to be better yeah okay

0:23:41.070,0:23:45.840
prolly won't quite make it done in a

0:23:44.010,0:23:47.640
final for her she's a bit better than

0:23:45.840,0:23:52.140
that needs more consistency than that

0:23:47.640,0:23:53.870
and sixty 1.05 for Carlton over means

0:23:52.140,0:23:57.750
that she's back in sixth place

0:23:53.870,0:24:00.929
Angela pang of Malaysia two point nine

0:23:57.750,0:24:03.340
back two and a half seven sorts oh it's

0:24:00.929,0:24:06.640
an absolute corker

0:24:03.340,0:24:09.340
shaky first round dive there we go her

0:24:06.640,0:24:13.030
teammates shouting and screaming and so

0:24:09.340,0:24:13.690
would I be beautiful take off such so

0:24:13.030,0:24:16.060
strong

0:24:13.690,0:24:17.920
fantastic look how she glides out with

0:24:16.060,0:24:19.840
her feet pointing down of the water and

0:24:17.920,0:24:21.640
absolutely buries the entry it's only

0:24:19.840,0:24:25.150
two point nine but when you score nines

0:24:21.640,0:24:27.640
on it like she will do here keeps you in

0:24:25.150,0:24:30.130
the mix good work yeah what a shame she

0:24:27.640,0:24:32.140
started with a 58.5 or or she'd be right

0:24:30.130,0:24:34.290
up there as an issues not too far adrift

0:24:32.140,0:24:38.530
she's made up some ground with that

0:24:34.290,0:24:41.650
seventy eight point three zero and she

0:24:38.530,0:24:44.050
is up to sixth but today is six up to

0:24:41.650,0:24:47.080
one separated by eight points the moment

0:24:44.050,0:24:49.360
early stage of course I'm here out to to

0:24:47.080,0:24:51.820
another of those armed stands there are

0:24:49.360,0:24:53.200
three point two variety and a three

0:24:51.820,0:24:55.840
point three variety and there will be a

0:24:53.200,0:24:57.910
three point one as well as the later on

0:24:55.840,0:25:01.210
but the most popular choice of the three

0:24:57.910,0:25:02.770
point two which this is stand back

0:25:01.210,0:25:07.450
double somersault one and a half twist

0:25:02.770,0:25:10.150
four whoo it's important that you show a

0:25:07.450,0:25:14.380
steady arm balance to the judges before

0:25:10.150,0:25:16.600
you go and Melissa manage that and then

0:25:14.380,0:25:19.540
this is where the hard work starts flick

0:25:16.600,0:25:21.760
the legs lift up the shoulders into the

0:25:19.540,0:25:25.330
twist and then finish that dive off

0:25:21.760,0:25:27.910
that's consistent sevens on this seven

0:25:25.330,0:25:30.700
and a half maybe to go with her first

0:25:27.910,0:25:36.490
round dive which is a good score 78 I

0:25:30.700,0:25:39.040
think first round 72 that's good yeah

0:25:36.490,0:25:43.060
into the lead she goes it's a lead of

0:25:39.040,0:25:44.830
about six points she is setting the mark

0:25:43.060,0:25:47.830
for everybody else to follow including

0:25:44.830,0:25:51.070
her Australian teammate that's Brittany

0:25:47.830,0:25:54.400
Broman 16 years of age you know with

0:25:51.070,0:25:58.410
three and a half somersaults 3.2 in the

0:25:54.400,0:25:58.410
tuck position for Brittany Broman

0:26:00.290,0:26:08.549
all right tremendous that should get

0:26:03.960,0:26:09.960
nines and 9.5 Wow there you go she knows

0:26:08.549,0:26:12.270
it's such a good feeling when you get a

0:26:09.960,0:26:14.100
dive like this that drills into the

0:26:12.270,0:26:16.440
water it's okay it's a safe distance and

0:26:14.100,0:26:18.059
this feeling when you bury a dive like

0:26:16.440,0:26:20.460
that it's almost like you're being

0:26:18.059,0:26:22.740
teleported some arouses extraordinary

0:26:20.460,0:26:24.900
noise in the ears of buzz through the

0:26:22.740,0:26:28.530
body into the water

0:26:24.900,0:26:31.290
big score 83 yeah very big scoring Dean

0:26:28.530,0:26:34.350
again it just ashamed that her first I

0:26:31.290,0:26:36.840
was not that accurate and not executed

0:26:34.350,0:26:38.940
to the fall and to the max because she

0:26:36.840,0:26:43.200
would be very much at the top as it

0:26:38.940,0:26:46.950
issues third that 83 point to zero now

0:26:43.200,0:26:50.130
Megan Vinh feto has some ground to make

0:26:46.950,0:26:52.020
up already it's not irretrievable three

0:26:50.130,0:26:54.150
point three back three and a half again

0:26:52.020,0:26:59.970
tuck position and they can find yourself

0:26:54.150,0:27:02.100
in the other custom position 12 well

0:26:59.970,0:27:04.500
that's gonna help that certainly is

0:27:02.100,0:27:06.540
gonna help such a shame when you blow

0:27:04.500,0:27:09.799
your opening dive when you lead yourself

0:27:06.540,0:27:12.150
with so much to do but he's obviously

0:27:09.799,0:27:14.370
left that dive where it is there's

0:27:12.150,0:27:16.919
nothing else you can do but focus on the

0:27:14.370,0:27:21.090
next one and that is a corker to come

0:27:16.919,0:27:24.900
back with wow we're finally seeing some

0:27:21.090,0:27:27.720
high quality dives from the ladies well

0:27:24.900,0:27:29.160
we are but from her point of view she

0:27:27.720,0:27:31.380
will look up at the scoreboard a moment

0:27:29.160,0:27:33.030
and see the classification after round 2

0:27:31.380,0:27:34.410
and she will know that she hasn't

0:27:33.030,0:27:37.470
actually made up a lot of ground at all

0:27:34.410,0:27:42.630
in terms of places when she's gone from

0:27:37.470,0:27:44.880
12 to 10 and you imagine this lady will

0:27:42.630,0:27:46.530
have number one besides her name and she

0:27:44.880,0:27:49.200
has done all the way through the

0:27:46.530,0:27:52.260
preliminaries and semi finals just

0:27:49.200,0:27:55.470
oozing confidence and hardly putting a

0:27:52.260,0:27:58.020
foot wrong so far in with three and a

0:27:55.470,0:28:01.380
half somersaults for the run away number

0:27:58.020,0:28:03.330
one Chinese at the moment formed in the

0:28:01.380,0:28:13.260
Tuck position here comes chain Ruolin

0:28:03.330,0:28:14.809
World and Olympic champion oh it's

0:28:13.260,0:28:18.210
fabulous

0:28:14.809,0:28:20.340
not worth attend maybe nines on that the

0:28:18.210,0:28:22.169
only thing incorrect or the only thing

0:28:20.340,0:28:24.000
wrong with that dive was there was a

0:28:22.169,0:28:26.669
little bit of splash thrown up

0:28:24.000,0:28:28.590
technically perfect jumps up over the

0:28:26.669,0:28:30.419
diving board squeezing into a perfect

0:28:28.590,0:28:32.970
tuck shape kick site through a pike

0:28:30.419,0:28:36.030
position very very well executed they'll

0:28:32.970,0:28:38.280
get over 80 points just showing her

0:28:36.030,0:28:41.730
class here look at the ankle snap

0:28:38.280,0:28:43.559
they're droplets of water tape on the

0:28:41.730,0:28:47.100
lower back to support an injury she has

0:28:43.559,0:28:48.270
but wow she does not look as though

0:28:47.100,0:28:52.890
she's going to get caught

0:28:48.270,0:28:56.429
follows up an 85.5 with an 84.8

0:28:52.890,0:29:00.900
and already a massive chasm between one

0:28:56.429,0:29:04.320
and the rest already a lead of 20 points

0:29:00.900,0:29:08.280
really yes 20 points between the Chinese

0:29:04.320,0:29:12.000
and the rest and here comes the

0:29:08.280,0:29:14.850
standings aren't around to 170 already

0:29:12.000,0:29:17.550
accrued for Chen rule in their Melissa

0:29:14.850,0:29:20.130
whoop and Paulo Espinoza Sanchez in

0:29:17.550,0:29:22.140
third which near Obon not far away or

0:29:20.130,0:29:24.600
indeed Illya her gotcha

0:29:22.140,0:29:26.220
I was trying to cast a few adrift at the

0:29:24.600,0:29:28.500
bottom a little hoot look who is at the

0:29:26.220,0:29:33.300
bottom who is at the bottom who's at the

0:29:28.500,0:29:34.980
bottom very interesting first two rounds

0:29:33.300,0:29:36.540
just to confirm how the judging works

0:29:34.980,0:29:39.090
there are seven judges each of the

0:29:36.540,0:29:41.040
judges mark out of ten the two highest

0:29:39.090,0:29:42.809
and two lowest marks are discounted to

0:29:41.040,0:29:44.490
leave the three remaining marks those

0:29:42.809,0:29:46.230
are the three without the lines through

0:29:44.490,0:29:48.480
those three marks are then added

0:29:46.230,0:29:51.120
together multiplied by 2 by of the

0:29:48.480,0:29:54.060
degree of difficulty to give the total

0:29:51.120,0:29:58.350
for that particular dive round 3

0:29:54.060,0:30:02.550
first diver here properly 2.9 back two

0:29:58.350,0:30:06.060
and a half summer sorts with pike it's

0:30:02.550,0:30:08.640
good she is having a consistent

0:30:06.060,0:30:10.110
performance 2.9 derivative got nice some

0:30:08.640,0:30:13.110
of the girls going for the backward

0:30:10.110,0:30:14.520
three and a half this young lady was

0:30:13.110,0:30:16.020
slightly easier back with two and a half

0:30:14.520,0:30:18.030
pipes and it's very good she just let

0:30:16.020,0:30:20.130
the legs drop there and arches into a

0:30:18.030,0:30:22.380
lower back doesn't seem to affect the

0:30:20.130,0:30:24.330
end she struggled to get more than seven

0:30:22.380,0:30:29.070
and a half so is it just drifts over a

0:30:24.330,0:30:31.680
vertical look at the tension on the

0:30:29.070,0:30:33.450
audience faces when the divers are there

0:30:31.680,0:30:35.460
going through the air having friends

0:30:33.450,0:30:38.580
family and acquaintances through agony

0:30:35.460,0:30:41.760
all of them and sixty five point two

0:30:38.580,0:30:44.490
five four broke up Chuck and she becomes

0:30:41.760,0:30:49.200
the first diver to go through the 200

0:30:44.490,0:30:50.940
barrier no foul up Espinoza Sanchez

0:30:49.200,0:30:52.620
reversed three and a half somersaults

0:30:50.940,0:30:57.560
with tuck she's worked her way up to

0:30:52.620,0:30:57.560
number three after round number two

0:31:05.980,0:31:11.260
oh it's good she's just a little bit

0:31:09.220,0:31:12.990
over throwing the splash up towards a

0:31:11.260,0:31:15.820
dime but she's the only female

0:31:12.990,0:31:17.649
performing this dive the men all do this

0:31:15.820,0:31:19.600
dive you need to be incredibly strong

0:31:17.649,0:31:22.120
incredibly dynamic to perform the

0:31:19.600,0:31:24.760
reverse three and a half and she does it

0:31:22.120,0:31:29.139
almost effortlessly but just overcooked

0:31:24.760,0:31:32.590
it over a vertical well I don't know six

0:31:29.139,0:31:34.929
is maybe but I'm impressed with the dive

0:31:32.590,0:31:37.990
that it's so difficult but not so

0:31:34.929,0:31:40.360
impressed with the execution or maybe

0:31:37.990,0:31:42.250
she's thinking that wasn't really part

0:31:40.360,0:31:44.559
of the plan and certainly wasn't really

0:31:42.250,0:31:46.960
a dive perhaps I should be included in

0:31:44.559,0:31:48.399
my program but it's priam she will have

0:31:46.960,0:31:50.919
done time and time again feels

0:31:48.399,0:31:52.539
comfortable enough with it but not feel

0:31:50.919,0:31:55.720
that comfortable with a score of sixty

0:31:52.539,0:31:57.460
one point zero five which temporarily at

0:31:55.720,0:31:59.159
least puts it into second place now and

0:31:57.460,0:32:01.870
they owe me back key three point two

0:31:59.159,0:32:03.820
back two and a half somersaults one and

0:32:01.870,0:32:07.200
a half twists formed in the pike

0:32:03.820,0:32:09.700
position that straight up-and-down

0:32:07.200,0:32:12.760
margin me short as she went into the

0:32:09.700,0:32:16.330
water quite complex lots of the girls

0:32:12.760,0:32:17.889
will be finishing on this dive three

0:32:16.330,0:32:19.419
point two degree of difficulty so the

0:32:17.889,0:32:24.730
potential is you can score very well

0:32:19.419,0:32:27.250
owner indeed over seventy points would

0:32:24.730,0:32:28.570
be a good score over 80 points should be

0:32:27.250,0:32:33.190
even better I think this will get early

0:32:28.570,0:32:34.600
70s it does 72 for Naomi backe seven

0:32:33.190,0:32:38.080
point five so we'll count the other

0:32:34.600,0:32:44.130
scores do not tell me to is the total

0:32:38.080,0:32:49.179
score for the Hungarian born Italian now

0:32:44.130,0:32:52.240
who you Dan twelfth place after round

0:32:49.179,0:32:54.580
two obviously out of sorts for reasons

0:32:52.240,0:32:56.320
that we don't really know I would back

0:32:54.580,0:32:59.440
double somersaults and this you got

0:32:56.320,0:33:01.240
three point to attach to it

0:32:59.440,0:33:03.240
well that's more like it she was

0:33:01.240,0:33:05.410
straight up and down vertical entry

0:33:03.240,0:33:07.780
throwing up a little bit of splash she

0:33:05.410,0:33:09.550
doesn't have any tape on her nothing on

0:33:07.780,0:33:11.680
the wrist nothing on the ankles lots of

0:33:09.550,0:33:14.650
the divers adding support to some of the

0:33:11.680,0:33:16.270
joints with tape whoo you Dan that's

0:33:14.650,0:33:19.870
much more like it but she's left herself

0:33:16.270,0:33:21.820
way too much to do that's a good shot

0:33:19.870,0:33:24.550
isn't it close up on the face popping up

0:33:21.820,0:33:26.710
into that twist technically very very

0:33:24.550,0:33:27.970
good indeed little bit of splash being

0:33:26.710,0:33:29.980
thrown up other than that it's a good

0:33:27.970,0:33:32.410
dive one of the few we've seen from this

0:33:29.980,0:33:33.690
young lady yeah she left it as Leo was

0:33:32.410,0:33:35.950
saying way too late though

0:33:33.690,0:33:40.270
mathematically everybody else would have

0:33:35.950,0:33:41.890
to go sideways and not complete their

0:33:40.270,0:33:44.980
dives for her to be in with a chance

0:33:41.890,0:33:48.370
it's just too much of a hill to climb

0:33:44.980,0:33:51.100
now for her Roslyn filly on in seventh

0:33:48.370,0:33:53.290
after round two in word three and a half

0:33:51.100,0:33:55.630
somersaults with tuck seen it before

0:33:53.290,0:34:01.690
here it is again worth three point two

0:33:55.630,0:34:04.150
in terms of degree of difficulty well a

0:34:01.690,0:34:06.940
little bit looser she went in not quite

0:34:04.150,0:34:09.700
holding the tension coaches obviously

0:34:06.940,0:34:12.160
clapping anyway just there we go arching

0:34:09.700,0:34:14.800
in the lower back not quite holding the

0:34:12.160,0:34:16.570
tension takeoff is good a little bit low

0:34:14.800,0:34:18.010
on the water so it needed to be sharp

0:34:16.570,0:34:20.140
out they can see just a little bit of

0:34:18.010,0:34:22.600
you know wavering in the body tension

0:34:20.140,0:34:25.030
throwing up that splash probably gets

0:34:22.600,0:34:28.320
Evans not quite as good as her previous

0:34:25.030,0:34:28.320
divers got 70

0:34:31.190,0:34:35.450
yeah doesn't match the seventy five

0:34:33.470,0:34:38.780
point nine zero she got in round two

0:34:35.450,0:34:41.020
sixty seven point two zero and it's

0:34:38.780,0:34:44.090
waiting again for anybody other than

0:34:41.020,0:34:46.010
general int to take this competition by

0:34:44.090,0:34:46.490
the scruff of the neck and say I want a

0:34:46.010,0:34:50.870
medal

0:34:46.490,0:34:56.900
there's nobody yet from her it's really

0:34:50.870,0:35:00.440
shown their full range top competitive

0:34:56.900,0:35:02.300
instincts they all stand back double

0:35:00.440,0:35:07.820
somersault well and a half twists fresh

0:35:02.300,0:35:10.760
dirt overcooked it too much on the start

0:35:07.820,0:35:13.430
so it's very important that you pop up

0:35:10.760,0:35:14.930
into this dive if you lean too far you

0:35:13.430,0:35:17.930
get too much whip and that causes

0:35:14.930,0:35:19.760
increased rotation which is exactly what

0:35:17.930,0:35:24.530
story does here and she just can't stop

0:35:19.760,0:35:27.980
it and over she goes so move slightly

0:35:24.530,0:35:29.990
down the field a little bit further away

0:35:27.980,0:35:31.640
from standing on the podium yeah well

0:35:29.990,0:35:34.130
nothing you can do about it now four

0:35:31.640,0:35:37.400
dimes have gone over 200 she has not as

0:35:34.130,0:35:39.440
yet and you've got to be up there to be

0:35:37.400,0:35:44.480
in the medal contention and she is fifth

0:35:39.440,0:35:45.500
currently few divers still go including

0:35:44.480,0:35:50.450
Yulia

0:35:45.500,0:35:54.110
Carlton over 3.0 back yeah opening dive

0:35:50.450,0:35:56.870
of the same degree of difficulty for

0:35:54.110,0:36:01.940
three and a half no I really like that

0:35:56.870,0:36:04.430
their work is superb she spins really

0:36:01.940,0:36:06.710
fast rotation giving her plenty of time

0:36:04.430,0:36:08.720
to line up she does let the dive go over

0:36:06.710,0:36:11.990
a vertical only marginally so this could

0:36:08.720,0:36:13.430
get ate slightly poor second round dive

0:36:11.990,0:36:15.710
has left her a little bit off the pace

0:36:13.430,0:36:18.130
only tenth after round two she will move

0:36:15.710,0:36:21.230
up after that good third round effort

0:36:18.130,0:36:23.750
there we go feeling that my calculator

0:36:21.230,0:36:25.010
might be blowing steam out by the end of

0:36:23.750,0:36:28.670
this evening it's gonna be an awful lot

0:36:25.010,0:36:30.680
of numbers to crunch at the end of this

0:36:28.670,0:36:34.600
competition because they are so so tight

0:36:30.680,0:36:37.700
for the minor medals if we ignore the

0:36:34.600,0:36:39.620
victor and gold medal ekta get everybody

0:36:37.700,0:36:41.660
else to stand a bunch up in that two to

0:36:39.620,0:36:46.430
eight position

0:36:41.660,0:36:48.950
and in a pang ix of the moment 3.2

0:36:46.430,0:36:50.750
degree of difficulty on this arm stand

0:36:48.950,0:36:56.150
back double somersault one and half

0:36:50.750,0:36:58.460
twists she's done exactly the same as

0:36:56.150,0:37:00.289
Christine she has gone after the dive a

0:36:58.460,0:37:05.690
little bit too aggressively and

0:37:00.289,0:37:08.150
therefore she's yeah she knows you can

0:37:05.690,0:37:09.619
tell by a body language here we go just

0:37:08.150,0:37:11.270
a little bit too aggressive and then

0:37:09.619,0:37:13.039
when she be pikes can't stop it from

0:37:11.270,0:37:14.630
going over you can see the splash moving

0:37:13.039,0:37:18.410
away from the diving board six and a

0:37:14.630,0:37:20.329
half's sevens at best moving further

0:37:18.410,0:37:23.750
away from the podium dive after dive

0:37:20.329,0:37:25.640
star with a 58 and it with a 64 this

0:37:23.750,0:37:27.740
time on a three point two dives she

0:37:25.640,0:37:32.180
would be lucky for upper 70s so probably

0:37:27.740,0:37:38.329
a tariff -15 on that means that she's

0:37:32.180,0:37:40.180
not really pushing no she's hitting very

0:37:38.329,0:37:43.099
similar figures to her right now

0:37:40.180,0:37:45.380
Melissa woo back three and a half

0:37:43.099,0:37:46.880
somersault with tuck is this the dive

0:37:45.380,0:37:50.869
that might cause us some problems she's

0:37:46.880,0:37:52.910
been pretty impeccable today three point

0:37:50.869,0:37:53.599
three degree of difficulty biggest one

0:37:52.910,0:37:56.750
that she does

0:37:53.599,0:37:59.390
oh you caught it Bob

0:37:56.750,0:38:01.640
I was doing my hand signal with a

0:37:59.390,0:38:03.289
shaking hand which means this is the

0:38:01.640,0:38:06.559
bogey dive which way is it going to go

0:38:03.289,0:38:08.480
and the answer to that is short short a

0:38:06.559,0:38:10.039
vertical on the entry just running out

0:38:08.480,0:38:13.130
of room she drifts back a little bit too

0:38:10.039,0:38:14.869
far kicks out a fraction too early lands

0:38:13.130,0:38:17.299
short of vertical five and a half sand

0:38:14.869,0:38:19.880
60s and that puts the cat amongst the

0:38:17.299,0:38:22.640
pigeons and everyone is bunched up

0:38:19.880,0:38:24.619
apart from a mule in everyone's bunched

0:38:22.640,0:38:28.220
up so no one watch so silver or bronze

0:38:24.619,0:38:30.920
looks like now does brittany broman want

0:38:28.220,0:38:33.289
to break out of the pack and show her

0:38:30.920,0:38:36.410
mettle 16 years of age show that she's a

0:38:33.289,0:38:38.660
very mature 16 year old has not phased

0:38:36.410,0:38:41.299
by anything here this will be a real

0:38:38.660,0:38:45.109
test for her though again it's the 3.2

0:38:41.299,0:38:47.140
armstand 3.3 coming later but this is a

0:38:45.109,0:38:51.490
3.2 version of it

0:38:47.140,0:38:51.490
stand back so Marcella sorts

0:38:51.910,0:39:03.009
time of the season of course that could

0:38:53.740,0:39:05.920
double somersault oh yes oh yes wow that

0:39:03.009,0:39:09.160
is bang on the money it doesn't get

0:39:05.920,0:39:11.920
better than that that entry is just well

0:39:09.160,0:39:14.289
there I say it's near-perfect

0:39:11.920,0:39:15.730
as it needs to be if anything she could

0:39:14.289,0:39:18.450
do with being a little bit tighter in

0:39:15.730,0:39:21.519
the air but lies a splash this entry

0:39:18.450,0:39:23.410
really really good judges were pretty

0:39:21.519,0:39:25.000
penalized because she was losing your

0:39:23.410,0:39:26.920
feet and legs a little bit in the air

0:39:25.000,0:39:30.880
they have but look at that eight point

0:39:26.920,0:39:34.299
five two nine 83 hello Australian eight

0:39:30.880,0:39:38.970
point five and nine makes your

0:39:34.299,0:39:42.339
catchphrase s alright it's a very good

0:39:38.970,0:39:44.230
die for the second Australian who's

0:39:42.339,0:39:47.740
becoming very much the first Australian

0:39:44.230,0:39:49.180
here as bromine goes into a 14-point

0:39:47.740,0:39:49.599
lead obviously won't hang around for too

0:39:49.180,0:39:52.599
long

0:39:49.599,0:39:54.670
saying Canadian will be followed very

0:39:52.599,0:39:57.460
shortly by the Chinese but he comes bent

0:39:54.670,0:40:01.210
feet OHS in with three and a half which

0:39:57.460,0:40:03.339
is 11th after round two so these dives

0:40:01.210,0:40:05.710
don't have to be absolutely impeccable

0:40:03.339,0:40:08.130
as she stands any chance of making a

0:40:05.710,0:40:08.130
challenge

0:40:08.549,0:40:15.730
nope she's got it on her head she is the

0:40:13.240,0:40:17.710
right way up Justin shot there that's a

0:40:15.730,0:40:19.809
shammy the divers use that to dry off

0:40:17.710,0:40:21.490
the legs so they can grip onto the shins

0:40:19.809,0:40:23.109
here as Megan's demonstrating if your

0:40:21.490,0:40:25.450
hands are wet and Chin's are wet you can

0:40:23.109,0:40:27.369
slip out and that isn't very good at all

0:40:25.450,0:40:29.859
also for drying themselves off and keep

0:40:27.369,0:40:32.529
him warm it's his good but she's left

0:40:29.859,0:40:39.279
herself way too much to do what an

0:40:32.529,0:40:41.650
absolute shame yep not her day 72 is an

0:40:39.279,0:40:44.180
okay mark but it's not good enough what

0:40:41.650,0:40:46.170
she needs at this stage

0:40:44.180,0:40:49.290
appreciating talent there's a lot of

0:40:46.170,0:40:52.590
Chinese supporters in the crowd I think

0:40:49.290,0:40:56.430
everybody just knows how good this young

0:40:52.590,0:41:02.940
lady is the big world champion 19 years

0:40:56.430,0:41:06.810
of age and out general in I'm stand back

0:41:02.940,0:41:11.100
double somersault again 3.2 already with

0:41:06.810,0:41:15.570
a 20-point lead and adding to that lead

0:41:11.100,0:41:19.890
dive after dive so consistent plenty of

0:41:15.570,0:41:21.540
Chinese support here and we are seeing a

0:41:19.890,0:41:24.150
master at work

0:41:21.540,0:41:27.420
here she is one and a half twist double

0:41:24.150,0:41:28.980
somersault drilling the entry just a

0:41:27.420,0:41:32.580
little bit too much glass for more than

0:41:28.980,0:41:35.670
a nine but three point two nines across

0:41:32.580,0:41:41.060
the board big score increased lead you

0:41:35.670,0:41:43.710
hear her 29 points now 20 up to 29 and

0:41:41.060,0:41:46.350
my new details maybe she's doing wrong

0:41:43.710,0:41:48.630
good for the majority of the time for

0:41:46.350,0:41:54.180
most of the dives it wasn't a great deal

0:41:48.630,0:41:56.970
you can fought it by 256 29 point lead

0:41:54.180,0:41:59.280
for general in Brittany browbone into

0:41:56.970,0:42:01.950
second 14-point lead for her preferred

0:41:59.280,0:42:05.670
over back heat and they're queuing up

0:42:01.950,0:42:10.920
behind for a got Chuck Philly on and Wu

0:42:05.670,0:42:12.630
on that page maybe over 200 probably

0:42:10.920,0:42:16.130
still just about then

0:42:12.630,0:42:20.730
Colton over Sanchez bent feet oh and

0:42:16.130,0:42:24.180
Pangu you damn it down if you do get

0:42:20.730,0:42:28.589
down if you don't so forth to 11th there

0:42:24.180,0:42:31.799
is what seven or eight points bunched up

0:42:28.589,0:42:41.190
nice to see bourbon in second place my

0:42:31.799,0:42:45.510
tip round for opening divert you earlier

0:42:41.190,0:42:48.059
for a got Chuck and gums the arm back

0:42:45.510,0:42:50.040
trip with summer sorts talking about the

0:42:48.059,0:42:51.569
three-point twos first time we get to

0:42:50.040,0:42:53.940
see the three point three in this

0:42:51.569,0:42:59.160
competition so the town for a bit higher

0:42:53.940,0:43:02.010
the risk a bit higher - oh she's smoked

0:42:59.160,0:43:04.049
it and some of the divers say when you

0:43:02.010,0:43:06.799
get the water get into the water without

0:43:04.049,0:43:10.020
any splash there's many different

0:43:06.799,0:43:13.460
terminologies use just pick one at the

0:43:10.020,0:43:16.319
archives there and she smoked it

0:43:13.460,0:43:19.020
Wow three point three high-risk high

0:43:16.319,0:43:22.130
degree of difficulty arm stand back

0:43:19.020,0:43:24.599
triple somersault in the tuck position

0:43:22.130,0:43:26.940
beautiful for fine die from the

0:43:24.599,0:43:29.880
Ukrainian keep himself in contention

0:43:26.940,0:43:33.470
your distance from the board good marks

0:43:29.880,0:43:35.819
across the Lord eight eight and eight

0:43:33.470,0:43:38.190
three point three degree of difficulty

0:43:35.819,0:43:41.160
when he add it all up comes to seventy

0:43:38.190,0:43:43.260
nine point two zero and she has put

0:43:41.160,0:43:45.059
herself in a good position for a medal

0:43:43.260,0:43:49.170
I'm currently in first place

0:43:45.059,0:43:52.280
Paulo Espinosa Sanchez of Mexico in with

0:43:49.170,0:43:52.280
three and a half we're tuck

0:43:59.220,0:44:04.990
or that's her best I've so fast she just

0:44:02.230,0:44:06.790
has his tendency to go in with a slight

0:44:04.990,0:44:09.340
back arch which gives the impression

0:44:06.790,0:44:10.180
she's much further over a vertical than

0:44:09.340,0:44:12.580
she actually is

0:44:10.180,0:44:15.940
that's so best dive so far you can't

0:44:12.580,0:44:17.980
fault this lady's takeoffs they are spot

0:44:15.940,0:44:20.470
on the entry into the water and letting

0:44:17.980,0:44:22.600
it down a yet again it's going to be her

0:44:20.470,0:44:26.830
high-scoring dive and get eight eight

0:44:22.600,0:44:28.780
point five well maybe she'd be putting

0:44:26.830,0:44:31.810
himself back in contention one dive to

0:44:28.780,0:44:34.780
go 18 points is good 80 points is very

0:44:31.810,0:44:36.340
good but is it enough not to take the

0:44:34.780,0:44:40.300
lead it's not because Brooke got Chuck

0:44:36.340,0:44:41.890
has got that by just over a mark and

0:44:40.300,0:44:46.690
that's how tight this competition really

0:44:41.890,0:44:48.970
is near me back key it's currently in

0:44:46.690,0:44:54.520
third place in with three and a half for

0:44:48.970,0:44:57.270
her three point two with tuck 80-85 she

0:44:54.520,0:45:00.820
goes flying back up the standings again

0:44:57.270,0:45:04.360
all feeling the pressure third after the

0:45:00.820,0:45:07.750
third round may be surprised to see

0:45:04.360,0:45:09.280
yourself so far up the field and this is

0:45:07.750,0:45:10.630
one of her most difficult dives safe

0:45:09.280,0:45:12.100
dishes from the diving board just

0:45:10.630,0:45:15.190
hanging on to a tuck shape a little bit

0:45:12.100,0:45:17.920
too long just a fraction over rotating

0:45:15.190,0:45:24.490
it'll only get I don't think it will get

0:45:17.920,0:45:26.440
17 so shuffling the pack once again yeah

0:45:24.490,0:45:28.690
it's almost kind of right will you have

0:45:26.440,0:45:30.550
a go now I'm quite happy to sit back and

0:45:28.690,0:45:32.350
watch you do something good or bad or

0:45:30.550,0:45:35.860
indifferent sixty eight point eight zero

0:45:32.350,0:45:37.630
four back eek and she goes well she's at

0:45:35.860,0:45:41.350
third now but she won't be staying there

0:45:37.630,0:45:43.450
for a long who you're damn sorry first

0:45:41.350,0:45:47.830
she's just so far off a game today back

0:45:43.450,0:45:51.570
three and a half with tuck go there you

0:45:47.830,0:45:54.660
go there is the burst of brilliance

0:45:51.570,0:45:56.250
it's young 16 year old silver medalist

0:45:54.660,0:45:57.960
from there we are the coaches a big

0:45:56.250,0:46:01.290
beaming smile she knows what she could

0:45:57.960,0:46:03.570
do this girl dives all day every day at

0:46:01.290,0:46:05.730
such a standard and this is a standard

0:46:03.570,0:46:09.090
that I'm accustomed to commentating on

0:46:05.730,0:46:11.940
from this superb talent from China but

0:46:09.090,0:46:13.740
she is messed up her first two dives so

0:46:11.940,0:46:16.200
considerably that even though this is

0:46:13.740,0:46:19.470
going to score poor nearly 90 points I

0:46:16.200,0:46:21.480
would imagine she will still only be

0:46:19.470,0:46:21.750
creeping up the field at best Wow look

0:46:21.480,0:46:24.480
at that

0:46:21.750,0:46:26.850
89 highs Markov the competition with

0:46:24.480,0:46:30.360
those nines multiplied by three point

0:46:26.850,0:46:33.420
three and she has moved up a few places

0:46:30.360,0:46:36.660
but she is still 23 points behind Pro

0:46:33.420,0:46:38.760
got chucked and 22 behind Sanchez and

0:46:36.660,0:46:43.050
that's gonna be a lot more ground to

0:46:38.760,0:46:45.120
make up three point three not really

0:46:43.050,0:46:46.650
helping in terms of I was in Philly all

0:46:45.120,0:46:49.140
getting in an upright position there arm

0:46:46.650,0:46:53.550
stand back triple somersault three point

0:46:49.140,0:46:56.550
three we're tuck oh it's good couldn't

0:46:53.550,0:46:59.880
quite hold the splash going really

0:46:56.550,0:47:01.770
strong takeoff she heals almost touch

0:46:59.880,0:47:04.980
the back of her legs as she bends in

0:47:01.770,0:47:06.450
fact they do lower back in fact flicks

0:47:04.980,0:47:07.140
in holding a little bit high on her

0:47:06.450,0:47:09.840
knees there

0:47:07.140,0:47:13.200
yes letting the dive go marginally over

0:47:09.840,0:47:14.970
so it's three point three so get a good

0:47:13.200,0:47:17.550
score it'll get over 70 points and if

0:47:14.970,0:47:19.260
she was more that might you did even

0:47:17.550,0:47:22.590
more pleased with that throwing up too

0:47:19.260,0:47:24.810
much splash seventy two point six zero

0:47:22.590,0:47:27.450
for the time being she moves up into

0:47:24.810,0:47:30.540
fourth mind bro got Chuck Sanchez and

0:47:27.450,0:47:35.130
backe has only eight points behind the

0:47:30.540,0:47:38.490
current leader that's makeable Kristine

0:47:35.130,0:47:41.580
step of Germany myself at the wrong end

0:47:38.490,0:47:43.440
of the table in 11th and this is a low

0:47:41.580,0:47:47.730
tariff dive which may not help her in

0:47:43.440,0:47:50.910
her reparation back two and a half whoa

0:47:47.730,0:47:53.490
what a dive that's exactly what you did

0:47:50.910,0:47:56.220
in the semi-finals very experienced and

0:47:53.490,0:48:00.320
this is exactly how you finish off a

0:47:56.220,0:48:02.420
dive a little bit low height wise

0:48:00.320,0:48:04.760
that's why she goes for the slightly

0:48:02.420,0:48:06.530
easier backward moving once she gets in

0:48:04.760,0:48:08.900
the water there with hardly a ripple of

0:48:06.530,0:48:10.610
splash little bit arched through the

0:48:08.900,0:48:21.260
lower back here as she pulls it round

0:48:10.610,0:48:23.450
but you can't fault that entry only

0:48:21.260,0:48:25.160
behind there she comes and here come the

0:48:23.450,0:48:27.410
mark seventy-three point nine five I

0:48:25.160,0:48:31.610
could tell you that's yulia coulton over

0:48:27.410,0:48:33.620
of russia up next eight point five s

0:48:31.610,0:48:35.840
across the board and she will go into

0:48:33.620,0:48:37.220
the lead which it obviously is second

0:48:35.840,0:48:39.980
place in terms of this competition with

0:48:37.220,0:48:43.370
the and one chinese dominating but she

0:48:39.980,0:48:45.920
can go right up to second overall if she

0:48:43.370,0:48:48.950
gets this three point two right oh and

0:48:45.920,0:48:51.530
she does she gets hit bang on the money

0:48:48.950,0:48:53.000
well predicted Bob I was watching this

0:48:51.530,0:48:55.910
in training it was a little bit here and

0:48:53.000,0:48:57.260
there might even crack a smile at the

0:48:55.910,0:48:59.120
end of the competition but at the moment

0:48:57.260,0:49:00.890
she has a game face on she spit too

0:48:59.120,0:49:03.620
close to the diving board though sorry

0:49:00.890,0:49:06.730
for the change in tonality I've seen too

0:49:03.620,0:49:09.500
many divers a little bit too close Oh

0:49:06.730,0:49:12.680
anyway she's a safe she's safely by the

0:49:09.500,0:49:14.870
diving board drills the entry and the

0:49:12.680,0:49:16.150
judges all award highly for that I'm

0:49:14.870,0:49:18.830
sure they do

0:49:16.150,0:49:21.230
no often heard on worldwide television

0:49:18.830,0:49:23.180
but Leon Taylor's Tarzan impression is

0:49:21.230,0:49:24.830
it's quite nicely I think

0:49:23.180,0:49:29.660
just a little whimper don't worry about

0:49:24.830,0:49:33.170
me seventy eight point four zero for

0:49:29.660,0:49:37.700
Colton over who goes into third place

0:49:33.170,0:49:39.560
but is so so tight at the top of

0:49:37.700,0:49:42.080
Malaysia in with three and a half three

0:49:39.560,0:49:44.060
point two yeah well that's what this

0:49:42.080,0:49:46.490
young lady can do I had it down as a

0:49:44.060,0:49:48.290
medal chance and she's faltered on a few

0:49:46.490,0:49:50.510
of the rounds left herself too much to

0:49:48.290,0:49:53.590
do but that is bang on the money this

0:49:50.510,0:49:55.670
inward three and a half superb height

0:49:53.590,0:49:58.070
he's a little bit close to the diving

0:49:55.670,0:49:59.750
board as well those of you that are

0:49:58.070,0:50:01.580
tweeting saying how come the divers are

0:49:59.750,0:50:02.900
so close well I agree with you they are

0:50:01.580,0:50:04.430
a little bit too close but if you move

0:50:02.900,0:50:05.810
too far away from the diving board

0:50:04.430,0:50:08.300
you'll never make this amount of

0:50:05.810,0:50:10.760
rotation so it's a fine line between

0:50:08.300,0:50:12.250
being close enough to make it and far

0:50:10.760,0:50:16.090
enough away

0:50:12.250,0:50:20.080
for safety she's back in the mix 81.6

0:50:16.090,0:50:22.720
she's only four points behind in effect

0:50:20.080,0:50:24.609
second place mmm but here come the two

0:50:22.720,0:50:28.119
Australians have been impressive and I'm

0:50:24.609,0:50:30.460
looking to get silver and bronze to kind

0:50:28.119,0:50:32.230
of turn around the Australians weak in

0:50:30.460,0:50:34.090
the Aquatic Centre in with three and a

0:50:32.230,0:50:38.470
half somersaults with tuck for Melissa

0:50:34.090,0:50:40.810
whoo well she's got it right on her

0:50:38.470,0:50:43.540
hands right on her head as we say in

0:50:40.810,0:50:45.700
diving which is actually a good thing so

0:50:43.540,0:50:46.960
up like just throwing up a little bit of

0:50:45.700,0:50:49.330
splash swallowed a bit of water the

0:50:46.960,0:50:51.820
heavy she went in looks like aerial work

0:50:49.330,0:50:53.740
is great touch shape is superb all bang

0:50:51.820,0:50:55.240
on the money just looking out shooting

0:50:53.740,0:50:55.869
up the water so maybe she'll get some

0:50:55.240,0:50:58.420
eights

0:50:55.869,0:50:59.849
if she was clean as in no splash she

0:50:58.420,0:51:02.410
would have got eight point five s and 9s

0:50:59.849,0:51:04.359
has two changes she's not quite lockout

0:51:02.410,0:51:08.260
on the finish maybe the water just the

0:51:04.359,0:51:09.910
boom what mark she got for that how much

0:51:08.260,0:51:13.030
the helper how much did it hinder her

0:51:09.910,0:51:15.940
seventy five point two zero four eight

0:51:13.030,0:51:18.790
and a seven point five and Melissa woo

0:51:15.940,0:51:22.150
and she slips a couple of places and is

0:51:18.790,0:51:25.330
back in sixth now Ken here Australian

0:51:22.150,0:51:27.250
colleague react more favorably more

0:51:25.330,0:51:29.650
positively with a back three and a half

0:51:27.250,0:51:31.050
three point three for Broman currently

0:51:29.650,0:51:35.500
in second place

0:51:31.050,0:51:38.109
sixes we'll keep her there oh I think

0:51:35.500,0:51:40.540
it's gonna get sixes or she she will

0:51:38.109,0:51:43.390
look back on that and think uh-oh

0:51:40.540,0:51:45.970
I think that's the dive that could have

0:51:43.390,0:51:48.369
potentially cost me a certain Olympic

0:51:45.970,0:51:50.470
medal still to play for if she does get

0:51:48.369,0:51:52.839
sixes which I think she will that's

0:51:50.470,0:51:55.300
going to put her very much bunched up in

0:51:52.839,0:51:57.130
this fight for the silver and bronze

0:51:55.300,0:51:58.690
what a shame Bobby could have

0:51:57.130,0:52:00.369
capitalized her if she'd had nailed that

0:51:58.690,0:52:02.290
she would have pretty much guaranteed

0:52:00.369,0:52:05.500
herself a medal now she's gonna have to

0:52:02.290,0:52:08.950
fight like crazy in the last round five

0:52:05.500,0:52:12.160
point five six and six workouts times

0:52:08.950,0:52:14.470
the degree of difficulty fifty seven

0:52:12.160,0:52:16.660
point seven five you will not believe

0:52:14.470,0:52:19.180
the scoreboard at the end of this round

0:52:16.660,0:52:22.750
just wait and see

0:52:19.180,0:52:25.619
it is absolutely astonishing how tight

0:52:22.750,0:52:25.619
it is

0:52:25.930,0:52:31.700
Megan been Fito one-and-only of course

0:52:30.520,0:52:33.410
armstand

0:52:31.700,0:52:37.160
and he done once in the competition and

0:52:33.410,0:52:39.290
this is the big one 3.30 she just get

0:52:37.160,0:52:42.710
this right she then jumps back into that

0:52:39.290,0:52:44.270
pack but she needs to be at the top of

0:52:42.710,0:52:47.240
the game eight point five so we'll put

0:52:44.270,0:52:48.770
her into first place and that certainly

0:52:47.240,0:52:50.780
won't get eight point five it's a shame

0:52:48.770,0:52:53.180
because the aerial work and the take-off

0:52:50.780,0:52:54.800
was good she was just out a little bit

0:52:53.180,0:52:58.040
early of the spin she's throwing the

0:52:54.800,0:52:59.630
water away there frustrated annoyed she

0:52:58.040,0:53:02.120
knows that her Olympic dreams of an

0:52:59.630,0:53:04.660
individual medallist slipping away just

0:53:02.120,0:53:07.340
as she slips short into the water that

0:53:04.660,0:53:08.960
she might get some sevens but she would

0:53:07.340,0:53:11.210
have needed eight and a half sand nines

0:53:08.960,0:53:15.020
to bring her back into that sandwich

0:53:11.210,0:53:17.480
that is around the second to seventh I

0:53:15.020,0:53:18.140
would call it a smorgasbord actually on

0:53:17.480,0:53:22.070
a sandwich

0:53:18.140,0:53:24.980
it is ridiculous how tight it is with

0:53:22.070,0:53:27.230
the exception of course of one diver who

0:53:24.980,0:53:29.600
is in a different competition in a

0:53:27.230,0:53:32.420
league of her own and already with

0:53:29.600,0:53:35.870
almost a 30 point lead after three

0:53:32.420,0:53:40.760
rounds almost up to 260 points already

0:53:35.870,0:53:42.500
general in back three and a half yeah

0:53:40.760,0:53:44.510
it's very good it's marginally short of

0:53:42.500,0:53:48.560
vertical it's a splash the Sentry she

0:53:44.510,0:53:52.160
goes in she really is a cut above

0:53:48.560,0:53:54.110
everyone else in this field it's a one

0:53:52.160,0:53:55.520
horse race out here today and this is

0:53:54.110,0:53:58.070
the horse we're looking at here as she

0:53:55.520,0:53:59.540
drills into the water it's probably not

0:53:58.070,0:54:02.030
going to get in the 80s but this would

0:53:59.540,0:54:03.140
be the first dive of hers that doesn't

0:54:02.030,0:54:06.800
and won't be far away

0:54:03.140,0:54:09.200
just a little marginally short here the

0:54:06.800,0:54:11.060
marks seventy nine point two zero her

0:54:09.200,0:54:12.890
lowest mark of the evening but in the

0:54:11.060,0:54:19.250
80s all the way through slips into the

0:54:12.890,0:54:23.360
70s but marginally but her lead is 49

0:54:19.250,0:54:28.250
points now look at this look at this -

0:54:23.360,0:54:33.230
86 to 85 to 84 - 84 to 82

0:54:28.250,0:54:35.190
holy moly there is nothing to pick

0:54:33.230,0:54:39.089
between

0:54:35.190,0:54:44.190
second to sixth let's see where 7th is 1

0:54:39.089,0:54:49.349
700 she's on to 82 to 82 as well to 81

0:54:44.190,0:54:53.250
to 78 so that is second to 9th all in

0:54:49.349,0:54:55.740
contention Wow it doesn't get any closer

0:54:53.250,0:54:58.920
than that thank you girls because you

0:54:55.740,0:55:02.730
have just brought this competition alive

0:54:58.920,0:55:05.760
a shoddy prelim shoddy semi and a

0:55:02.730,0:55:07.859
super-tight the last round into the

0:55:05.760,0:55:11.700
final where will the medals go one two

0:55:07.859,0:55:16.950
that young lady yeah nobody can't afford

0:55:11.700,0:55:20.940
a slip-up here 2 to 9 separated by

0:55:16.950,0:55:23.520
virtually nothing at all to everybody in

0:55:20.940,0:55:26.339
the first half of the groupings up for a

0:55:23.520,0:55:27.300
medal including for a got Chuck oh she

0:55:26.339,0:55:29.579
doesn't want a medal

0:55:27.300,0:55:31.500
she is decided with the last dive that

0:55:29.579,0:55:32.819
she does not want a medal she's feeling

0:55:31.500,0:55:35.190
the pressure maybe she looked at the

0:55:32.819,0:55:37.980
scoreboard maybe she didn't we will not

0:55:35.190,0:55:39.630
know Ariel work is good you'll see a lot

0:55:37.980,0:55:41.160
of the girls do this one to finish one

0:55:39.630,0:55:41.819
and a half twist two and a half

0:55:41.160,0:55:45.720
somersaults

0:55:41.819,0:55:48.480
way over into the water now after some

0:55:45.720,0:55:50.940
fabulous diving she's gone and let it

0:55:48.480,0:55:53.670
all go on this final dive she will play

0:55:50.940,0:55:55.980
that over and over in her head well the

0:55:53.670,0:55:57.930
door was just swung open look the

0:55:55.980,0:56:00.930
teammates say it all head in the hand

0:55:57.930,0:56:08.420
stuff ouch here's a mark

0:56:00.930,0:56:10.950
oh no 57.6 0 dear dear dear she was

0:56:08.420,0:56:14.670
right on top of the game and dive number

0:56:10.950,0:56:18.030
4 and right off her game in dive number

0:56:14.670,0:56:20.720
5 so that could well be forgot Chuck

0:56:18.030,0:56:23.750
gone in terms of metal now

0:56:20.720,0:56:26.690
this lady was the bronze medal winner

0:56:23.750,0:56:30.380
last year at the world so she knows how

0:56:26.690,0:56:35.420
to do it in the moment she is in third

0:56:30.380,0:56:37.280
place 3.2 to finish off her program

0:56:35.420,0:56:39.650
there's back two and a half samasource

0:56:37.280,0:56:44.800
1/2 2 has been done by most of the

0:56:39.650,0:56:44.800
divers in the final round round five oh

0:56:45.940,0:56:53.000
well it's okay now it needed to be

0:56:51.020,0:56:56.960
better than that to guarantee a medal it

0:56:53.000,0:56:59.750
could end up being good enough but she

0:56:56.960,0:57:04.069
really is off a game exactly the same

0:56:59.750,0:57:06.230
dive as we saw from the Ukrainian and

0:57:04.069,0:57:08.359
the Mexican they're not managing to

0:57:06.230,0:57:12.290
capsize her door was open I think she's

0:57:08.359,0:57:14.990
gonna get above she being the lead

0:57:12.290,0:57:16.339
currently only second diver in not good

0:57:14.990,0:57:21.380
enough for a medal I don't think though

0:57:16.339,0:57:21.770
wait and see 70 point four zero is the

0:57:21.380,0:57:23.750
mark

0:57:21.770,0:57:26.119
actually what over Rios does yet of

0:57:23.750,0:57:27.980
course but seven point five and a seven

0:57:26.119,0:57:29.390
she would have hope for a great deal

0:57:27.980,0:57:30.109
better than that I see in the fur

0:57:29.390,0:57:33.530
program

0:57:30.109,0:57:35.599
it's a hug from the coach and now just

0:57:33.530,0:57:37.400
has to sit and wait and see if that's

0:57:35.599,0:57:40.160
good enough it may not be she isn't

0:57:37.400,0:57:42.770
number one position right now all the

0:57:40.160,0:57:46.730
main protagonists around her are still

0:57:42.770,0:57:48.950
to go including this rather surprised

0:57:46.730,0:57:51.230
potential medalist in the only bat cake

0:57:48.950,0:57:53.210
from Italy reversed two and a half

0:57:51.230,0:57:54.859
slight difference to everybody else in

0:57:53.210,0:57:59.140
the spiralizer only two point seven

0:57:54.859,0:58:02.540
thousand got to be absolutely faultless

0:57:59.140,0:58:04.550
well it's very good it is very good but

0:58:02.540,0:58:06.829
two point seven she's finished on one of

0:58:04.550,0:58:10.880
it her lowest degree of difficulty I

0:58:06.829,0:58:12.530
think she came with tactics not very

0:58:10.880,0:58:14.720
well played it's obviously a favorite

0:58:12.530,0:58:19.040
dive that's why she finishes on it but

0:58:14.720,0:58:22.310
she can't match the three point twos Wow

0:58:19.040,0:58:25.490
but it's a good effort 88.5 I don't

0:58:22.310,0:58:27.940
think that will be good enough to get

0:58:25.490,0:58:30.819
above Espinosa

0:58:27.940,0:58:32.289
and chin to the water well this phone

0:58:30.819,0:58:34.150
around the scoreboard just kind of

0:58:32.289,0:58:37.869
grinds to a halt doesn't it let's say

0:58:34.150,0:58:41.140
waiting here they come and it isn't good

0:58:37.869,0:58:43.510
enough to overtake the Mexican into

0:58:41.140,0:58:44.890
second place and sadly from her point of

0:58:43.510,0:58:46.809
view and I think the look on her face

0:58:44.890,0:58:49.210
will indicate exactly what she's

0:58:46.809,0:58:53.770
thinking at sixty seven point five zero

0:58:49.210,0:58:56.200
three fifty point oh five means the best

0:58:53.770,0:58:59.049
she can realistically do now is a bronze

0:58:56.200,0:59:01.869
and hope that everybody else falters and

0:58:59.049,0:59:07.780
the rest of the program not likely to

0:59:01.869,0:59:10.150
happen who you damn oh she did perfect

0:59:07.780,0:59:12.039
tens she would get into a middle

0:59:10.150,0:59:16.180
position but always she'd been diving

0:59:12.039,0:59:17.980
today Wow

0:59:16.180,0:59:20.349
so that's going to get a bag full of

0:59:17.980,0:59:22.960
nines maybe even a nine point five so

0:59:20.349,0:59:25.780
who you Dan is decided to wake up and do

0:59:22.960,0:59:27.700
too near on perfect dives in mine for

0:59:25.780,0:59:31.690
she scored the highest score dive of the

0:59:27.700,0:59:33.490
competition at 89 this is probably going

0:59:31.690,0:59:36.940
to be the second high-scoring dive of

0:59:33.490,0:59:39.010
the competition she's just shown two

0:59:36.940,0:59:41.020
bursts of brilliance and because of the

0:59:39.010,0:59:43.240
quality of the competition so far and

0:59:41.020,0:59:46.150
they hated missed nature she's probably

0:59:43.240,0:59:48.039
put herself back not too far not too far

0:59:46.150,0:59:52.000
away from the podium be very interesting

0:59:48.039,0:59:55.960
to see well he kinda marks all three

0:59:52.000,0:59:58.150
four nine just behind back team yeah she

0:59:55.960,1:00:00.010
is and just behind Sanchez which means

0:59:58.150,1:00:04.059
in effect you will not begin here middle

1:00:00.010,1:00:07.630
today I guess the kampachi and her

1:00:04.059,1:00:14.680
fellow Chinese general in and it's got

1:00:07.630,1:00:19.180
so much to actually secure the gold

1:00:14.680,1:00:22.630
already just has to complete the dive in

1:00:19.180,1:00:23.829
any fashion and she'll be okay Rosalie

1:00:22.630,1:00:25.960
and filly on again

1:00:23.829,1:00:27.700
not gonna be in the medals today back

1:00:25.960,1:00:31.140
two and a half somersaults one half

1:00:27.700,1:00:33.569
twist Pike three point two to finish

1:00:31.140,1:00:36.630
yeah she asked a little bit over a

1:00:33.569,1:00:38.400
fraction over she goes in he's had a

1:00:36.630,1:00:40.829
tough day but she did get better and

1:00:38.400,1:00:42.779
better as we move from the premiums to

1:00:40.829,1:00:44.940
the semies to the final young lady

1:00:42.779,1:00:47.970
obviously already Olympic bronze

1:00:44.940,1:00:52.799
medalist with Megan who's coming up

1:00:47.970,1:00:56.039
later on as you know this year's final

1:00:52.799,1:00:58.200
dive in the competition it's so tight

1:00:56.039,1:01:00.809
you never really know do you don't know

1:00:58.200,1:01:05.970
she doesn't know her marks yet so make

1:01:00.809,1:01:10.079
you a wait a little bit before yeah we

1:01:05.970,1:01:13.650
have two divers who and for the on three

1:01:10.079,1:01:15.660
four nine we have Becky on 350 at out

1:01:13.650,1:01:18.779
ideas for the medals but Sanchez has a

1:01:15.660,1:01:21.059
six-point advantage she currently is in

1:01:18.779,1:01:22.619
what in effect is the silver medal

1:01:21.059,1:01:25.650
position for the Mexican there she is

1:01:22.619,1:01:27.749
waiting and hoping and knowing that

1:01:25.650,1:01:31.619
she's been diving better tonight and she

1:01:27.749,1:01:32.099
did in the prelims and in the semi final

1:01:31.619,1:01:35.400
as well

1:01:32.099,1:01:37.049
yep just get a fish off her program with

1:01:35.400,1:01:37.499
the dive that many did in the first

1:01:37.049,1:01:38.910
round

1:01:37.499,1:01:40.829
it's that forward three and a half

1:01:38.910,1:01:43.980
somersaults with Pike to finish for the

1:01:40.829,1:01:45.839
German well what if it would have died

1:01:43.980,1:01:49.380
to finish on as well what a finish to

1:01:45.839,1:01:56.549
the dive to buried the entry hardly a

1:01:49.380,1:01:58.920
ripple of splash again this wow it's so

1:01:56.549,1:02:00.420
so close she was tenth wasn't she after

1:01:58.920,1:02:02.130
the fourth eye and I think with a lower

1:02:00.420,1:02:04.859
degree of difficulty even though it's

1:02:02.130,1:02:07.650
been performed exceptionally well it's

1:02:04.859,1:02:09.660
that standing dive to finish on well

1:02:07.650,1:02:12.950
probably gonna be a bit too much to

1:02:09.660,1:02:18.509
stand on the podium or is it

1:02:12.950,1:02:20.599
78 78 from bone time eight point five

1:02:18.509,1:02:24.170
and nine she's gone into second place

1:02:20.599,1:02:27.029
351 no game bad key out of a medal and

1:02:24.170,1:02:29.809
the German you know we thought was gone

1:02:27.029,1:02:33.539
for all money may not quite be yet

1:02:29.809,1:02:35.160
there's still some divers more highly

1:02:33.539,1:02:39.569
ranked in terms of the standings and

1:02:35.160,1:02:41.700
chic including yulia coulton over it's a

1:02:39.569,1:02:44.539
three point two like many of the others

1:02:41.700,1:02:49.579
are back two and a half somersaults 1/2

1:02:44.539,1:02:53.089
twists to 84 her current score 8 in the

1:02:49.579,1:02:56.029
70s well I think that is going to go

1:02:53.089,1:02:58.419
into the 70s this spot Yulia responding

1:02:56.029,1:03:01.009
to the pressure knows it's so tight

1:02:58.419,1:03:04.969
there's nothing she can do apart from

1:03:01.009,1:03:07.759
concentrate on the dive at hand and she

1:03:04.969,1:03:10.459
has done a very good job marginally

1:03:07.759,1:03:14.059
short she's gone in but she's clean tidy

1:03:10.459,1:03:16.009
and she was in fifth place before so I

1:03:14.059,1:03:17.900
think she's gonna top it that is good

1:03:16.009,1:03:18.559
enough let's wait and see some agonizing

1:03:17.900,1:03:22.459
wait come on

1:03:18.559,1:03:29.419
scoreboard where are you picked in yet

1:03:22.459,1:03:32.479
so devious Smith it's okay 7300 on its

1:03:29.419,1:03:38.209
top place she's overtaken Espinoza

1:03:32.479,1:03:40.160
Sanchez by one point seven points now

1:03:38.209,1:03:40.669
it's not going to be gold fir but at the

1:03:40.160,1:03:45.699
moment

1:03:40.669,1:03:48.729
Colton over is looking at a silver medal

1:03:45.699,1:03:50.749
Espinoza Sanchez is looking at a bronze

1:03:48.729,1:03:58.009
but there's still some more to come

1:03:50.749,1:04:01.279
including handle a pang same dive same

1:03:58.009,1:04:05.539
kind of mark needed 75 or there abouts

1:04:01.279,1:04:07.819
might just get it done for her oh it's a

1:04:05.539,1:04:10.669
good effort just marginally over

1:04:07.819,1:04:12.109
vertical or they could have shout and

1:04:10.669,1:04:14.299
cheer as loud as they come because they

1:04:12.109,1:04:17.269
know there are teammates know how tight

1:04:14.299,1:04:19.549
it is Wow what if climax

1:04:17.269,1:04:21.319
well if planned alone it was just a

1:04:19.549,1:04:24.739
little bit more vertical desi just

1:04:21.319,1:04:26.900
tipping over it's a shame it's a 3.2

1:04:24.739,1:04:29.719
again all the girls using this time to

1:04:26.900,1:04:31.429
finish on oh she made some mistakes

1:04:29.719,1:04:33.259
earlier in a program otherwise she'd

1:04:31.429,1:04:34.519
have been guaranteed a medal look at

1:04:33.259,1:04:36.380
this look at this

1:04:34.519,1:04:39.259
Wow there you go three five nine she's

1:04:36.380,1:04:41.359
going to the lead Dalton over down to

1:04:39.259,1:04:43.770
two Espinoza Sanchez will not get a

1:04:41.359,1:04:47.520
medal today

1:04:43.770,1:04:50.220
goodness gracious me what drama seventy

1:04:47.520,1:04:53.130
six point eight zero for the nineteen

1:04:50.220,1:04:55.050
year old from Malaysia so we do a

1:04:53.130,1:04:57.900
calculation not guaranteed a medal yet

1:04:55.050,1:05:00.180
though just not yeah Melissa Roos in

1:04:57.900,1:05:02.190
contention of course she's a serving

1:05:00.180,1:05:04.530
contention well she still is still tight

1:05:02.190,1:05:06.750
if she nails this it's gotta be around

1:05:04.530,1:05:08.820
eighty though yep on this three point

1:05:06.750,1:05:10.740
two back two and a half seven sauce 1/2

1:05:08.820,1:05:14.400
twist she's looking at the big eight

1:05:10.740,1:05:16.440
zero to get up in the middles oh it's

1:05:14.400,1:05:18.600
probably not clean enough a little bit

1:05:16.440,1:05:20.700
too much splashy is that bike there you

1:05:18.600,1:05:22.380
see the other contenders they've done

1:05:20.700,1:05:23.820
their dives now they have to wait and

1:05:22.380,1:05:26.520
see what the judges think

1:05:23.820,1:05:28.200
Melissa rude giving it all on this last

1:05:26.520,1:05:30.810
dive a little bit too far away from the

1:05:28.200,1:05:34.350
diving board but she does get in it's

1:05:30.810,1:05:42.060
tidy a little bit too much splash where

1:05:34.350,1:05:45.510
will she finish that's my client agent

1:05:42.060,1:05:48.450
their boyfriend their marks coming very

1:05:45.510,1:05:51.870

1:05:48.450,1:05:54.270
three five eight just behind the

1:05:51.870,1:05:56.850
Malaysian yeah she's into second place

1:05:54.270,1:05:58.500
currently she might finger LeBrons were

1:05:56.850,1:06:02.430
there again she might be edged out of it

1:05:58.500,1:06:06.960
by her teammate Brittany broman sixteen

1:06:02.430,1:06:10.770
years of age and she needs well not as

1:06:06.960,1:06:14.310
much to go into the lead she needs 76

1:06:10.770,1:06:18.090
this was my bet for the medal 76 is all

1:06:14.310,1:06:20.880
she needs say all she needs still got to

1:06:18.090,1:06:22.800
be executed this dive pretty accurately

1:06:20.880,1:06:25.230
three point two back two and a half

1:06:22.800,1:06:29.690
somersaults one artist look for 76 or

1:06:25.230,1:06:29.690
above to go into the lead

1:06:33.470,1:06:39.300
yes that's good enough that will be

1:06:35.819,1:06:43.800
silver for the 16 year old Australian

1:06:39.300,1:06:47.119
what an incredible contest yes that is

1:06:43.800,1:06:50.369
good enough that is good enough Wow

1:06:47.119,1:06:52.079
outstanding performance wow it's not

1:06:50.369,1:06:54.089
often I look into my crystal ball and

1:06:52.079,1:06:56.160
predict something so accurately but they

1:06:54.089,1:06:58.859
did say after the prelims in the semi

1:06:56.160,1:07:01.650
but this young 16 year old is on for a

1:06:58.859,1:07:04.920
medal and that is the silver right there

1:07:01.650,1:07:09.329
well done well done Britney big smile

1:07:10.589,1:07:17.579
eighty one point six zero but Brittany

1:07:14.069,1:07:19.079
Broman Australian silver it's this one

1:07:17.579,1:07:22.970
than beside her name but there's a

1:07:19.079,1:07:26.369
Chinese who is far far away in terms of

1:07:22.970,1:07:30.300
competition and she is not gonna catch

1:07:26.369,1:07:33.119
her but while she has just captured is a

1:07:30.300,1:07:33.809
silver medal and it will be the way

1:07:33.119,1:07:37.819
things are looking

1:07:33.809,1:07:42.480
Australian silver and Malaysian bronze

1:07:37.819,1:07:45.510
Pam what a competition and that means

1:07:42.480,1:07:47.790
that Melissa woo misses out by just over

1:07:45.510,1:07:50.280
one point from a middle a clip in

1:07:47.790,1:07:52.380
Australian to three Megan benefit Oh to

1:07:50.280,1:07:54.349
finish off with for Canada back two and

1:07:52.380,1:07:56.910
a half again one of the half twists

1:07:54.349,1:07:59.490
she's finished so strongly and she'll be

1:07:56.910,1:08:02.460
kicking herself because of a few dives

1:07:59.490,1:08:04.079
where she's been under par she didn't

1:08:02.460,1:08:06.809
quite leave herself in contention for

1:08:04.079,1:08:08.369
this well this final flourish that we've

1:08:06.809,1:08:10.710
been seeing here in the final round all

1:08:08.369,1:08:12.359
the girls choosing to do this most of

1:08:10.710,1:08:13.859
them the back two and a half one and a

1:08:12.359,1:08:16.290
half twist all finishing on the

1:08:13.859,1:08:19.620
three-point to died for dive for dive

1:08:16.290,1:08:21.150
for dive direct comparison some divers

1:08:19.620,1:08:22.410
choosing to dive from the left hand or

1:08:21.150,1:08:24.839
the right hand side of the board or the

1:08:22.410,1:08:27.540
middle it's complete preference and here

1:08:24.839,1:08:29.069
we go that agonizing wait now my

1:08:27.540,1:08:30.630
computer has a bit of a sense of humor

1:08:29.069,1:08:33.929
just once everybody hold on for a little

1:08:30.630,1:08:36.179
longer and tenth place is where she will

1:08:33.929,1:08:38.100
finish certainly not where she wanted to

1:08:36.179,1:08:39.390
finish and she's distraught by that

1:08:38.100,1:08:43.270
thought she could do better

1:08:39.390,1:08:46.850
as expected to do better but just

1:08:43.270,1:08:50.810
now let's round off with something of

1:08:46.850,1:08:55.880
real class real finesse and real

1:08:50.810,1:08:59.859
expertise never troubled never Ries

1:08:55.880,1:09:03.109
Tepig online always impeccable today

1:08:59.859,1:09:09.319
it's been a master class of 10 metre

1:09:03.109,1:09:12.409
platform diving from general in three

1:09:09.319,1:09:15.100
and a half to finish now it's a dive

1:09:12.409,1:09:17.750
back two and a half one and a half twist

1:09:15.100,1:09:20.989
absolutely phenomenal performance from

1:09:17.750,1:09:23.330
prelim to semi to final retaining her

1:09:20.989,1:09:26.270
Olympic title that she won when she was

1:09:23.330,1:09:29.029
only 15 years old in Beijing here she is

1:09:26.270,1:09:32.029
at 19 and she is stormed to another

1:09:29.029,1:09:33.739
victory she was the only diver here

1:09:32.029,1:09:36.109
really in this competition it was a

1:09:33.739,1:09:39.469
one-horse race she left everyone from

1:09:36.109,1:09:42.889
dive one and this finishing off in fine

1:09:39.469,1:09:44.630
style indeed showing her class there was

1:09:42.889,1:09:47.270
a real fight for the lesser medals and

1:09:44.630,1:09:50.810
chain rule in goes into diving history

1:09:47.270,1:09:52.819
retaining her Olympic title what a dive

1:09:50.810,1:09:56.659
from this young lady and what a set of

1:09:52.819,1:10:01.489
dives 86 to finish eighty six point four

1:09:56.659,1:10:07.060
zero she wins the competition by 56

1:10:01.489,1:10:10.000
points 56 points between first place and

1:10:07.060,1:10:13.820
second place and that is quite

1:10:10.000,1:10:16.699
astonishing and quite astonishing too

1:10:13.820,1:10:20.090
for that 16 year old from Australia who

1:10:16.699,1:10:25.280
really cannot believe it it's true pinch

1:10:20.090,1:10:27.350
yourself because it is 360 6.50 and

1:10:25.280,1:10:30.350
she's going to go to friends and family

1:10:27.350,1:10:33.170
and hug and kiss and it'll be just such

1:10:30.350,1:10:34.699
an emotional moment for her who's she

1:10:33.170,1:10:36.619
trying to pick out the Australians are

1:10:34.699,1:10:37.710
over that side she doesn't know what to

1:10:36.619,1:10:40.640
do

1:10:37.710,1:10:45.090
where to go who to hard cooter talk to

1:10:40.640,1:10:49.350
16 years of age a great semi and a

1:10:45.090,1:10:52.080
fantastic final for Broman of Australia

1:10:49.350,1:10:57.210
and let's not overlook that lady and

1:10:52.080,1:10:59.370
Ryan's medalist for Hamed thought a

1:10:57.210,1:11:01.950
one-stage she might have blown it she

1:10:59.370,1:11:06.900
had to do a lot of work at the end this

1:11:01.950,1:11:11.520
is how I finished them for two 2.30 for

1:11:06.900,1:11:14.520
Chen Groban winning her silver by 7 but

1:11:11.520,1:11:19.290
the bronze only secured by Angela pang

1:11:14.520,1:11:21.570
by 1.1 mark and everybody else below

1:11:19.290,1:11:25.440
that line will go I've only had done

1:11:21.570,1:11:27.150
that we've only had done that who you

1:11:25.440,1:11:29.969
Dan did well to move up tonight

1:11:27.150,1:11:34.230
Elia forgot Chuck on the basis of her

1:11:29.969,1:11:35.880
opening dive in the last round falling

1:11:34.230,1:11:38.969
right down to the bottom and the two

1:11:35.880,1:11:41.340
Canadians in 10th and 11th well that was

1:11:38.969,1:11:42.480
absolutely anybody's for the silver and

1:11:41.340,1:11:45.120
bronze Wow

1:11:42.480,1:11:46.590
how I've not seen a competition that

1:11:45.120,1:11:48.900
tight with the remainder of the pack

1:11:46.590,1:11:51.239
Jeremy Lin way out in front and everyone

1:11:48.900,1:11:53.370
else well how in the mix I didn't think

1:11:51.239,1:11:55.770
anyone wanted it at one stage but this

1:11:53.370,1:11:59.550
young lady certainly did Britney Probert

1:11:55.770,1:12:01.680
16 years old Panda Lenna 19 in the

1:11:59.550,1:12:06.270
Olympic champion generally in 19 so it's

1:12:01.680,1:12:08.340
won by girls under the age of 19 top

1:12:06.270,1:12:10.530
three and well it's great about this she

1:12:08.340,1:12:12.150
really didn't know what to do where do I

1:12:10.530,1:12:14.010
go who do I talk to

1:12:12.150,1:12:15.660
what's a protocol now can I go and see

1:12:14.010,1:12:17.460
my family can I go and say hello to my

1:12:15.660,1:12:19.350
friends or is there a medal so she

1:12:17.460,1:12:22.650
really didn't know it's like a head was

1:12:19.350,1:12:24.060
spinning as she took in the realization

1:12:22.650,1:12:25.560
that she's an Olympic silver medalist

1:12:24.060,1:12:29.010
yeah I know what that feelings like you

1:12:25.560,1:12:31.530
have to keep calm composed focused when

1:12:29.010,1:12:33.510
you're performing under such expectation

1:12:31.530,1:12:35.040
and pressure and when you actually do it

1:12:33.510,1:12:37.050
when you look at that scoreboard and

1:12:35.040,1:12:39.840
your name is next to a medal position

1:12:37.050,1:12:42.989
it's like the the dam burst and all

1:12:39.840,1:12:45.210
those emotions just flood come flooding

1:12:42.989,1:12:49.290
through and you don't know which ways up

1:12:45.210,1:12:50.960
or down or sideways look at that great

1:12:49.290,1:12:52.430
embrace with a coach

1:12:50.960,1:12:55.400
and there we are Britney with her coat

1:12:52.430,1:12:59.150
such a journey the hours and hours of

1:12:55.400,1:13:02.510
hard work and dedication payoff embraces

1:12:59.150,1:13:04.190
all round well and then of course the

1:13:02.510,1:13:05.719
fourth fifth and sixth and seventh will

1:13:04.190,1:13:06.739
be in eighth the ninth and tenth and

1:13:05.719,1:13:08.420
eleventh and twelfth and this

1:13:06.739,1:13:11.030
competition will be thinking what if

1:13:08.420,1:13:13.550
what if I was just a bit better on one

1:13:11.030,1:13:15.830
of my dives maybe just maybe it would

1:13:13.550,1:13:21.710
have been my moment my moment to stand

1:13:15.830,1:13:22.400
on that podium but today Chen was way

1:13:21.710,1:13:27.110
out in front

1:13:22.400,1:13:29.750
roben well I backed a silver medalist

1:13:27.110,1:13:31.370
and panned Elena pang fantastic in

1:13:29.750,1:13:34.580
bronze whoo just outside

1:13:31.370,1:13:37.370
well agonizing fourth place now if you

1:13:34.580,1:13:39.260
are a diver or a swimmer who has to get

1:13:37.370,1:13:41.780
up at a ridiculously early hour of the

1:13:39.260,1:13:43.250
morning we know you do four o'clock five

1:13:41.780,1:13:45.739
o'clock in the morning to go to training

1:13:43.250,1:13:49.160
this young lady who's just won the

1:13:45.739,1:13:51.290
silver medal gets up at 4:15 every

1:13:49.160,1:13:53.540
morning for training she has to go well

1:13:51.290,1:13:56.239
over an hour to go to Brisbane to the

1:13:53.540,1:13:57.739
Gold Coast to Train and obviously over

1:13:56.239,1:14:01.610
an hour back she's still at school

1:13:57.739,1:14:04.370
trying to combine all that and just see

1:14:01.610,1:14:06.260
the reward it has brought to her by just

1:14:04.370,1:14:08.180
digging in there and going to you know

1:14:06.260,1:14:09.860
what 4:15 the one that really won't be

1:14:08.180,1:14:11.840
getting out of bed but this one I want

1:14:09.860,1:14:13.520
to achieve and she has achieved she's

1:14:11.840,1:14:16.130
not achieved it as a fluke you may think

1:14:13.520,1:14:17.870
because some of the bigger names failed

1:14:16.130,1:14:20.750
a bit today or was slightly off their

1:14:17.870,1:14:23.989
game no she didn't win it by default she

1:14:20.750,1:14:26.300
won it on their own efforts they're just

1:14:23.989,1:14:29.330
fantastic I was must admit I was

1:14:26.300,1:14:31.850
disappointed through the prelims through

1:14:29.330,1:14:36.650
the semi-final how that final turned out

1:14:31.850,1:14:38.510
to be a real corker and as we wait for

1:14:36.650,1:14:42.770
the moment when the medals are handed

1:14:38.510,1:14:44.570
I'd just get chance to reflect on the

1:14:42.770,1:14:47.180
thrills we've had here in the diving

1:14:44.570,1:14:50.210
pool obviously the Olympic Games started

1:14:47.180,1:14:51.980
on the 27th the diving first contest on

1:14:50.210,1:14:54.230
the 29th that we've been here every

1:14:51.980,1:14:55.400
single day part from one we have left we

1:14:54.230,1:14:57.170
haven't left yeah I've just I think I

1:14:55.400,1:14:59.480
just stay here I stay here with my

1:14:57.170,1:15:02.719
headphones on waiting for more action

1:14:59.480,1:15:04.729
and yep so that was a slow slow burn up

1:15:02.719,1:15:08.989
the women's platform

1:15:04.729,1:15:10.400
what a exciting climax I can't ask for

1:15:08.989,1:15:12.079
more than that more drama on the last

1:15:10.400,1:15:14.599
round there bub you're our calculators

1:15:12.079,1:15:19.969
and our you know predictions and crystal

1:15:14.599,1:15:24.340
balls and Wow top eight all over 350 top

1:15:19.969,1:15:28.610
eight all over 350 the bronze 366 the

1:15:24.340,1:15:30.409
Silverado 366 the bronze 359 and right

1:15:28.610,1:15:31.999
down to backe who again looked like she

1:15:30.409,1:15:33.949
might be in there but what did for her

1:15:31.999,1:15:36.709
and we keep making this point she had a

1:15:33.949,1:15:40.550
low tariff dive to finish right at the

1:15:36.709,1:15:42.349
end now she'd had a 3.1 a 3.2 or she had

1:15:40.550,1:15:44.659
gone for a broker then we might be

1:15:42.349,1:15:46.309
talking about the Italian as a bronze

1:15:44.659,1:15:49.309
medalist possibly a silver medal but she

1:15:46.309,1:15:51.590
went for an easy option and easy her

1:15:49.309,1:15:53.690
options shall we say in the last round

1:15:51.590,1:15:56.179
an ultimate whenever Rios is doing 3.2 s

1:15:53.690,1:15:57.650
and you're doing a 2.9 there's a big

1:15:56.179,1:15:59.510
differential there yeah that's why it's

1:15:57.650,1:16:01.489
2.7 actually the dice she finished on

1:15:59.510,1:16:03.469
she's giving away point 5 she of course

1:16:01.489,1:16:04.789
used her three-point to the back two and

1:16:03.469,1:16:07.670
a half one and a half twist which you

1:16:04.789,1:16:09.409
saw all the ladies doing the final round

1:16:07.670,1:16:11.510
notice the game of tactics that probably

1:16:09.409,1:16:13.880
didn't work out for Naomi bhakti they're

1:16:11.510,1:16:16.909
from Italy finishing in eighth when she

1:16:13.880,1:16:18.829
was very much in there for a medal what

1:16:16.909,1:16:20.690
am I the Canadians disappointing

1:16:18.829,1:16:22.820
yeah disappointing for the girls there

1:16:20.690,1:16:25.219
but of course they do have an Olympic

1:16:22.820,1:16:26.599
medal in their room in the Olympic

1:16:25.219,1:16:28.789
Village or wherever they choose to keep

1:16:26.599,1:16:31.880
it from the synchronized event and they

1:16:28.789,1:16:34.309
dived Wow awesomely well in that event a

1:16:31.880,1:16:36.409
highly run contest as you would imagine

1:16:34.309,1:16:39.559
and they ended up with an Olympic bronze

1:16:36.409,1:16:43.340
and couldn't quite raise their game here

1:16:39.559,1:16:45.349
in the final or all ladies faltering but

1:16:43.340,1:16:47.599
some more than others and the Canadians

1:16:45.349,1:16:50.539
just finishing at the bottom of the pack

1:16:47.599,1:16:56.479
just look at the sequence of dies for

1:16:50.539,1:16:57.349
Chen 85 84 86 slightly less slightly

1:16:56.479,1:16:59.900
being the operative word

1:16:57.349,1:17:01.729
seventy nine point two at 86 what a

1:16:59.900,1:17:04.010
sequence of dives ocean everyone to the

1:17:01.729,1:17:05.449
nineties and she never had a 10 sadly

1:17:04.010,1:17:07.699
which i think would have underlined that

1:17:05.449,1:17:09.650
performance but you know how consistent

1:17:07.699,1:17:11.659
is that well that's the name of the game

1:17:09.650,1:17:13.459
isn't it and she is you know a cut above

1:17:11.659,1:17:16.820
the rest if you just look at that lowest

1:17:13.459,1:17:18.110
scoring dive of 79 and then everything

1:17:16.820,1:17:18.530
in the 80s and with the degree of

1:17:18.110,1:17:20.390
difficult

1:17:18.530,1:17:22.790
she's using she's maxing out isn't she

1:17:20.390,1:17:25.730
so nines pretty much across the board on

1:17:22.790,1:17:28.070
most of her dies makes her untouchable

1:17:25.730,1:17:30.560
what an absolute champion to retain her

1:17:28.070,1:17:31.970
Olympic title and she's only 19 how can

1:17:30.560,1:17:33.620
you have two Olympic titles when you're

1:17:31.970,1:17:35.540
19 Wow

1:17:33.620,1:17:37.520
and one of that bourbon who dropped will

1:17:35.540,1:17:40.250
not drop but silly was well below what

1:17:37.520,1:17:43.310
should be around before opening dive was

1:17:40.250,1:17:45.020
weak for her low degree of difficulty 60

1:17:43.310,1:17:48.740
that could have been more and dive

1:17:45.020,1:17:50.030
number four which was her what was it

1:17:48.740,1:17:51.830
about three and a half that was the one

1:17:50.030,1:17:54.260
that was the big dive probably her bogey

1:17:51.830,1:17:56.030
dive and she did underperformed

1:17:54.260,1:17:58.040
certainly on that dive but it didn't

1:17:56.030,1:18:02.060
affect the result look at that she was

1:17:58.040,1:18:04.940
clearly in bronze by six points yeah

1:18:02.060,1:18:07.370
only four bonds I mean a silver a head

1:18:04.940,1:18:09.290
of bronze by six points my massive

1:18:07.370,1:18:11.330
margin but it was what she needed and

1:18:09.290,1:18:13.100
well that's kind of the final we needed

1:18:11.330,1:18:15.530
because I think we often a bit

1:18:13.100,1:18:19.160
lackluster a bit lukewarm after the

1:18:15.530,1:18:20.630
prelims last night 75 didn't really get

1:18:19.160,1:18:22.910
us out of our seats and on the edge of

1:18:20.630,1:18:25.970
them this morning but just because it

1:18:22.910,1:18:27.290
was so competitive and so close Yuri

1:18:25.970,1:18:29.300
didn't know which way was gonna go you

1:18:27.290,1:18:31.040
knew the gold pretty much from the

1:18:29.300,1:18:32.660
outset there's never gonna be much

1:18:31.040,1:18:34.970
question about that but it's really

1:18:32.660,1:18:37.010
exciting when you sing to countries or

1:18:34.970,1:18:38.420
in this case five or six countries all

1:18:37.010,1:18:39.770
going for the bronze and silver medals

1:18:38.420,1:18:41.660
yeah it doesn't get it's like the

1:18:39.770,1:18:43.490
swimming mates all coming in in a line

1:18:41.660,1:18:45.560
you never really know where who's gonna

1:18:43.490,1:18:47.420
get it until the touch but obviously the

1:18:45.560,1:18:50.180
drama here in the diving pool because it

1:18:47.420,1:18:52.730
is like for like dive for dive most of

1:18:50.180,1:18:55.190
the girls then opting to you know decide

1:18:52.730,1:18:57.230
but an hour before the competition the

1:18:55.190,1:18:59.090
dives need to be submitted to the

1:18:57.230,1:19:01.580
officials and so we know what's coming

1:18:59.090,1:19:04.820
up there's the game of tactics and where

1:19:01.580,1:19:06.350
some of them very well played so if you

1:19:04.820,1:19:07.970
have just joined us just a recount we'll

1:19:06.350,1:19:11.660
have the medal ceremony for you very

1:19:07.970,1:19:14.000
shortly but chain rule in of China 19

1:19:11.660,1:19:15.830
years of age has retained her title from

1:19:14.000,1:19:19.370
Beijing the world champion from last

1:19:15.830,1:19:22.310
year in Shanghai in great style she won

1:19:19.370,1:19:25.850
it by 56 points in the end all very

1:19:22.310,1:19:29.780
nearly give or take a couple of sented

1:19:25.850,1:19:32.420
points roben of australia britney broman

1:19:29.780,1:19:34.160
16 years of age the big surprise

1:19:32.420,1:19:36.199
although actually after the semi is not

1:19:34.160,1:19:38.030
quite so surprised we kind of almost

1:19:36.199,1:19:41.560
marked jacquard on her doing role

1:19:38.030,1:19:45.110
tonight winning her silver medal by

1:19:41.560,1:19:46.670
seven points and handling a pang but one

1:19:45.110,1:19:48.739
stage we thought hard just giving

1:19:46.670,1:19:51.140
herself a bit too much to do is 64 and

1:19:48.739,1:19:53.300
dive number three and she seemed to have

1:19:51.140,1:19:57.080
let it slip but then she came back with

1:19:53.300,1:19:58.969
an 81 and a 76 and pulled herself right

1:19:57.080,1:20:00.830
up the standings a minister whoo not

1:19:58.969,1:20:04.219
gonna be her day by just over a point

1:20:00.830,1:20:06.980
one point one zero in the end cult anova

1:20:04.219,1:20:08.420
had it in her hands and just couldn't I

1:20:06.980,1:20:11.660
mean she was consistent throughout but

1:20:08.420,1:20:13.489
just didn't have that big dive in the

1:20:11.660,1:20:16.520
80's to lift her up there Espinoza

1:20:13.489,1:20:18.410
Sanchez was not quite fortunate to make

1:20:16.520,1:20:21.080
the semis anyway improved in the

1:20:18.410,1:20:23.300
semi-final and certainly improved in the

1:20:21.080,1:20:24.860
final as well but again wasn't quite

1:20:23.300,1:20:27.380
enough for the other Christians sure

1:20:24.860,1:20:29.270
well a shoe might be a very surprising

1:20:27.380,1:20:32.750
medalist in one stage but everybody else

1:20:29.270,1:20:34.489
up their game and backe in 8th place

1:20:32.750,1:20:35.540
right at the bottom every case you're

1:20:34.489,1:20:39.500
wondering we already heard about one

1:20:35.540,1:20:41.390
Chinese who you Dan just never got going

1:20:39.500,1:20:45.170
early on and all the sudden from out of

1:20:41.390,1:20:46.940
absolutely nowhere to immaculate dives

1:20:45.170,1:20:48.860
and we just didn't see that coming no

1:20:46.940,1:20:50.480
great word well we've seen it in

1:20:48.860,1:20:51.940
training she was world silver medalist

1:20:50.480,1:20:54.410
last year in Shanghai in a performance

1:20:51.940,1:20:56.300
there was outstanding she in fact pushed

1:20:54.410,1:20:58.010
Chen so where if you remember that

1:20:56.300,1:21:00.050
contest it was very closely run and

1:20:58.010,1:21:01.760
since we've seen it here in prelims and

1:21:00.050,1:21:03.860
semies who you done it's been way off

1:21:01.760,1:21:06.080
the pace first three rounds here she was

1:21:03.860,1:21:07.880
way off the pace and then she comes out

1:21:06.080,1:21:10.730
with the highest-scoring dive of the

1:21:07.880,1:21:12.110
competition at 89 points for about three

1:21:10.730,1:21:13.940
and a half which is three point three

1:21:12.110,1:21:15.620
degree of difficulty and then she backs

1:21:13.940,1:21:18.949
it right up with her back two and a half

1:21:15.620,1:21:20.660
one and a half twist for 86.4 and then

1:21:18.949,1:21:24.110
she puts herself right back up in

1:21:20.660,1:21:25.460
contention and ends up in fifth position

1:21:24.110,1:21:30.800
well she missed out on the middle by two

1:21:25.460,1:21:31.730
point well two points 349 against 351 so

1:21:30.800,1:21:33.410
that's how close it was

1:21:31.730,1:21:34.850
so no you ended up in Knights I beg your

1:21:33.410,1:21:39.410
pardon but she went all the way up there

1:21:34.850,1:21:45.050
Yeah right we are ready to go the divers

1:21:39.410,1:21:46.820
in position to be paraded on poolside

1:21:45.050,1:21:48.560
it shows a lot of tears and a lot of

1:21:46.820,1:21:50.630
emotion and a lot of excitement now

1:21:48.560,1:21:52.220
they're probably not for the victor cuz

1:21:50.630,1:21:55.930
she's done it so many times before it's

1:21:52.220,1:21:59.360
pretty much routine at the chain rule in

1:21:55.930,1:22:01.970
but for the others from AB roben first

1:21:59.360,1:22:04.700
time for Pam who was involved in the

1:22:01.970,1:22:07.640
synchro last week so she got a flavor of

1:22:04.700,1:22:11.290
this building and the competition in the

1:22:07.640,1:22:14.600
pool in the synchronized event last week

1:22:11.290,1:22:17.420
she has picked up a bronze medal but

1:22:14.600,1:22:19.070
that's a lineup we weren't really

1:22:17.420,1:22:22.400
expecting when the competition got

1:22:19.070,1:22:24.350
underway it is another goal for China

1:22:22.400,1:22:26.900
they've only missed out so far on the

1:22:24.350,1:22:31.460
men's three meter individual all the

1:22:26.900,1:22:37.700
other goals have gone to China there's a

1:22:31.460,1:22:41.000
nice bonus bronze for and he's delighted

1:22:37.700,1:22:42.890
and I think Chan will break open a smile

1:22:41.000,1:22:44.540
shortly and they will definitely see one

1:22:42.890,1:22:45.440
from Brittney browbone who it's just

1:22:44.540,1:22:47.240
taking it all in

1:22:45.440,1:22:50.390
looking around and looking at the crowd

1:22:47.240,1:22:53.950
and wanting to soak up every little

1:22:50.390,1:22:56.750
fiber and what is happening here to hurt

1:22:53.950,1:22:58.970

1:28:18.429,1:28:22.630
dive most consistently because I would

1:28:20.350,1:28:25.300
