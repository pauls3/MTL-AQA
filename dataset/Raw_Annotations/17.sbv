0:00:00.000,0:00:04.200
fifth and last but by no means least as

0:00:01.979,0:00:09.150
far as he's concerned anyway we can't

0:00:04.200,0:00:11.519
bend Eddy of Italy so before we get

0:00:09.150,0:00:13.230
underway we've had a question for one of

0:00:11.519,0:00:14.490
our punters by Twitter and thank you to

0:00:13.230,0:00:16.230
all the people who have contacted both

0:00:14.490,0:00:19.650
Leon and myself on Twitter about the

0:00:16.230,0:00:21.779
spray onto the surface of the diving

0:00:19.650,0:00:23.460
people could you explain please sir yes

0:00:21.779,0:00:25.500
I could so just on the other side of the

0:00:23.460,0:00:27.480
flowers there what you're seeing is

0:00:25.500,0:00:29.820
ripples on the surface of the water now

0:00:27.480,0:00:32.610
they're caused by well what can best be

0:00:29.820,0:00:35.670
described as hose pipes pointing in from

0:00:32.610,0:00:37.500
the side of the of the diving pool now

0:00:35.670,0:00:39.149
this the intention behind this is just

0:00:37.500,0:00:40.649
to disturb there we are the sprays well

0:00:39.149,0:00:42.510
done thanks very much director look at

0:00:40.649,0:00:45.270
that the spray coming there just to the

0:00:42.510,0:00:46.950
right of screen is actually disturbing

0:00:45.270,0:00:48.750
the water the reason for this is the

0:00:46.950,0:00:51.270
divers need to know exactly where the

0:00:48.750,0:00:53.699
surface of the water is if there are no

0:00:51.270,0:00:55.680
sprays the water becomes very very still

0:00:53.699,0:00:57.180
and you focus on the bottom of the

0:00:55.680,0:00:59.280
diving pool which is of course another

0:00:57.180,0:01:01.559
five point eight meters away from the

0:00:59.280,0:01:03.059
surface so the divers need to be very

0:01:01.559,0:01:05.129
precise when they're going to grab their

0:01:03.059,0:01:08.549
hands and punch that hole in the water

0:01:05.129,0:01:11.010
and the ripples there ensure the divers

0:01:08.549,0:01:12.750
can make that judgement correctly most

0:01:11.010,0:01:15.840
of the time well that's the problem

0:01:12.750,0:01:18.810
anyway I hopefully resolved for them

0:01:15.840,0:01:20.970
today with that spray onto the surface

0:01:18.810,0:01:24.540
hope that has answer the question which

0:01:20.970,0:01:26.759
a few people have posed to us time to

0:01:24.540,0:01:28.920
get underway with the first of the

0:01:26.759,0:01:30.570
twenty nine divers six rounds remember

0:01:28.920,0:01:33.240
five rounds with the women six round

0:01:30.570,0:01:36.020
with the men and the opening diver will

0:01:33.240,0:01:38.640
be Ethan warrant from Australia and

0:01:36.020,0:01:39.990
three point zero degree of difficulty in

0:01:38.640,0:01:44.329
the pike position to start off with is

0:01:39.990,0:01:44.329
his back two and a half somersaults

0:01:48.060,0:01:51.700
they little bit of splash being thrown

0:01:50.380,0:01:54.460
up there you could just see the

0:01:51.700,0:01:56.650
Australian front in there you know you

0:01:54.460,0:02:00.100
know agreeing with me beautiful take off

0:01:56.650,0:02:01.960
I was tricky opening up the contest 3.0

0:02:00.100,0:02:03.670
only she asked over a little bit of her

0:02:01.960,0:02:05.890
to go see the splash being thrown up

0:02:03.670,0:02:07.509
it's only gonna get 7z that needs to be

0:02:05.890,0:02:09.550
diving a little bit better than that to

0:02:07.509,0:02:11.560
put some pressure on these guys he's an

0:02:09.550,0:02:16.120
exceptional performer let's wait and see

0:02:11.560,0:02:17.010
my favorite number number 63 gets back

0:02:16.120,0:02:19.720
again

0:02:17.010,0:02:21.670
three sevens times three we've had that

0:02:19.720,0:02:23.170
a lot in the women's I presume we're

0:02:21.670,0:02:23.830
getting quite a few time in the men's as

0:02:23.170,0:02:32.069
well

0:02:23.830,0:02:32.069
63 for Warren now Damien Sealy of France

0:02:36.420,0:02:43.690
in were 2 and our summer saucer we've

0:02:39.010,0:02:45.489
been a splash here just a little bit but

0:02:43.690,0:02:48.310
you'd be surprised how exceptional this

0:02:45.489,0:02:50.260
guy is yes he is super bulky I think he

0:02:48.310,0:02:53.200
just needs to look at weights in order

0:02:50.260,0:02:55.000
to to gain muscle size incredible but

0:02:53.200,0:02:56.769
look at the power he generates inward

0:02:55.000,0:02:59.230
two and a half way above the diving

0:02:56.769,0:03:01.030
board effortless dive just making a

0:02:59.230,0:03:02.140
little bit of a mistake on the entry

0:03:01.030,0:03:04.480
into the water there

0:03:02.140,0:03:06.700
it'll get mid-60s but in the men's

0:03:04.480,0:03:08.980
competition you want to be sailing over

0:03:06.700,0:03:12.630
70 and even into the 80s to ensure

0:03:08.980,0:03:15.430
qualification so Damien Sealy is opening

0:03:12.630,0:03:17.650
dive produces sixty seven point five

0:03:15.430,0:03:18.940
zero remember three marks that you see

0:03:17.650,0:03:20.620
without a line through them are the ones

0:03:18.940,0:03:24.280
that count and you'll multiply that by

0:03:20.620,0:03:29.820
the degree of difficulty 3.0 on that

0:03:24.280,0:03:34.540
occasion onto the first of the Chinese

0:03:29.820,0:03:37.480
comes perch on back two and a half

0:03:34.540,0:03:39.489
summer sorts with Pike 3.0 and I'm

0:03:37.480,0:03:44.109
usually the Chinese separated by quite

0:03:39.489,0:03:45.670
some way so wait until way into the

0:03:44.109,0:03:48.040
contest before you see a second here

0:03:45.670,0:03:49.860
comes the first of Chinese the world

0:03:48.040,0:03:52.830
champion

0:03:49.860,0:03:56.460
yep he's a defending Olympic champion

0:03:52.830,0:03:58.950
also and looking in fine form here only

0:03:56.460,0:04:00.570
25 years old but already Olympic

0:03:58.950,0:04:02.100
champion four years ago and he'll be

0:04:00.570,0:04:03.840
looking to retain his title tomorrow

0:04:02.100,0:04:06.480
night but he still has to get look how

0:04:03.840,0:04:08.670
easy does that dive feet pointing Diane

0:04:06.480,0:04:11.820
this will get eight and a half it's not

0:04:08.670,0:04:15.960
as good as I've seen him do it but just

0:04:11.820,0:04:17.820
showing his pure class well as the

0:04:15.960,0:04:20.670
marker for everybody else to follow in

0:04:17.820,0:04:24.600
round one eight and an eight point five

0:04:20.670,0:04:27.510
times three just having a quick scowl at

0:04:24.600,0:04:28.530
his coach give him what for tell me Mary

0:04:27.510,0:04:30.870
can improve and I'm sure he knows

0:04:28.530,0:04:32.190
exactly what he has to do in with three

0:04:30.870,0:04:33.720
and a half somersaults we're talking

0:04:32.190,0:04:35.850
we're going for a big starter here

0:04:33.720,0:04:40.170
because that's off three point four

0:04:35.850,0:04:42.630
degree of difficulty for his opener and

0:04:40.170,0:04:45.540
it's a beauty as well Wow

0:04:42.630,0:04:48.210
so giverny is not going to give anything

0:04:45.540,0:04:49.800
away today he is D deed up to the max

0:04:48.210,0:04:51.900
look at that tape or down is back we're

0:04:49.800,0:04:54.150
talk more about that later not quite

0:04:51.900,0:04:56.370
sure how much of a benefit it is

0:04:54.150,0:04:58.290
obviously it's not affecting his dive

0:04:56.370,0:05:00.510
because that's three point four degree

0:04:58.290,0:05:02.970
of difficulty inward standing backwards

0:05:00.510,0:05:04.950
spinning forward that's a monster start

0:05:02.970,0:05:06.630
three look at that eighty-one that's why

0:05:04.950,0:05:08.310
I call brave we see more in the women

0:05:06.630,0:05:09.900
some people go over to point seven two

0:05:08.310,0:05:11.130
point eight he's gone in there straight

0:05:09.900,0:05:13.560
away saying I'm gonna make a statement

0:05:11.130,0:05:14.760
here and here comes a big dive straight

0:05:13.560,0:05:17.190
on would you believe that's one of his

0:05:14.760,0:05:20.010
easier dives three point four exciting

0:05:17.190,0:05:22.950
down a notch but not by much to Daniel

0:05:20.010,0:05:24.480
Arroyo of Mexico three point three on

0:05:22.950,0:05:28.230
this reverse two and a half one and a

0:05:24.480,0:05:29.910
half twists oh my goodness he's a little

0:05:28.230,0:05:32.280
bit close to the diving board there

0:05:29.910,0:05:34.110
you'll see on the replay his Tootsie's

0:05:32.280,0:05:35.490
come a little bit too close for comfort

0:05:34.110,0:05:37.710
for me look at this leaning over the

0:05:35.490,0:05:39.990
diving board squeezing into the fight

0:05:37.710,0:05:41.790
shape there he doesn't really want to be

0:05:39.990,0:05:43.880
any closer than that losing the control

0:05:41.790,0:05:46.320
of the dive as he goes into the water oh

0:05:43.880,0:05:48.990
this is the aerial shot all these all

0:05:46.320,0:05:50.430
right calm down calm down the judges

0:05:48.990,0:05:52.140
should penalize I wouldn't give him more

0:05:50.430,0:05:56.240
than a five or a five point five for

0:05:52.140,0:06:00.180
that and we got two injuries

0:05:56.240,0:06:03.620
down there Daniel Arroyo 61 point zero

0:06:00.180,0:06:03.620
five and they're near pedicure

0:06:04.800,0:06:11.730
Stephane feck of Germany to our Irish

0:06:10.180,0:06:16.120
viewers are enjoying that pronunciation

0:06:11.730,0:06:18.700
it's correct Fe CK is his surname back

0:06:16.120,0:06:22.180
two and a half somersaults with bike 3.0

0:06:18.700,0:06:23.650
degree of difficulty so we've come for

0:06:22.180,0:06:26.380
three point four to three point three

0:06:23.650,0:06:34.300
and back to normality if you like this

0:06:26.380,0:06:36.610
pike dive for stiff and thick it needed

0:06:34.300,0:06:38.020
to be good and I think that there's a

0:06:36.610,0:06:40.840
little bit off the mark for Stefan

0:06:38.020,0:06:43.660
normally a very very solid diver two

0:06:40.840,0:06:45.280
Germans in this Stefan the first one

0:06:43.660,0:06:46.570
here we are backward two and a half in

0:06:45.280,0:06:48.610
the pike position just bending at the

0:06:46.570,0:06:50.350
hips good Pike shape looks good till

0:06:48.610,0:06:52.360
they're just short of vertical landing

0:06:50.350,0:06:54.940
short as he goes in it's only gonna get

0:06:52.360,0:06:56.470
seven in half and I won't score over

0:06:54.940,0:06:58.810
seventy points and a lower degree of

0:06:56.470,0:07:01.630
difficulty needs to be nailed work to do

0:06:58.810,0:07:04.360
for Stefan feeling their way into the

0:07:01.630,0:07:09.400
competition and Stefan affect seven

0:07:04.360,0:07:11.440
point five across the board x 360 7.50 I

0:07:09.400,0:07:13.750
say would give me a diving and a math

0:07:11.440,0:07:20.670
lesson at the same time get value from

0:07:13.750,0:07:23.020
us don't you now to chop or Venezuela

0:07:20.670,0:07:26.890
height position for this inward two and

0:07:23.020,0:07:29.040
a half well steady start from the

0:07:26.890,0:07:33.430
Venezuela in his first Olympic Games

0:07:29.040,0:07:34.780
only 21 years old and if he continues to

0:07:33.430,0:07:36.040
dive out that I'm sure would be very

0:07:34.780,0:07:37.330
happy and watch him in training a little

0:07:36.040,0:07:39.760
bit hit-and-miss this is one of his

0:07:37.330,0:07:40.990
better dives straight up and down he

0:07:39.760,0:07:43.480
needs to be a safe distance from the

0:07:40.990,0:07:46.090
diving board which he is in word

0:07:43.480,0:07:48.160
spinning forwards yeah it's technically

0:07:46.090,0:07:49.960
proficient and it's reasonable diver

0:07:48.160,0:07:51.010
seven-and-a-half probably eight maybe

0:07:49.960,0:07:53.310
let's see

0:07:51.010,0:07:56.590
well entering enough we've gone from the

0:07:53.310,0:07:58.510
63s to the 67.5 being the current

0:07:56.590,0:08:01.980
currency for a lot of the dynastar see a

0:07:58.510,0:08:05.560
fourth mark of 67.5 we've seen today

0:08:01.980,0:08:10.000
see our Castro our Brazil for two and a

0:08:05.560,0:08:12.490
half with one twist no it's beautifully

0:08:10.000,0:08:14.390
executed it's a very easy die though

0:08:12.490,0:08:17.450
lots of the divers

0:08:14.390,0:08:19.700
to use the more complicated twisting

0:08:17.450,0:08:22.670
dives say so here a lot of the girls use

0:08:19.700,0:08:25.070
this dive not taking a turn away from

0:08:22.670,0:08:27.650
the way says our cruise does that dive I

0:08:25.070,0:08:29.240
still think he could add another twist

0:08:27.650,0:08:31.250
you see a lot of divers doing a double

0:08:29.240,0:08:33.380
twist here says I'll just going for the

0:08:31.250,0:08:35.600
single twist maybe later in his program

0:08:33.380,0:08:37.850
yeah he does use the forward two and a

0:08:35.600,0:08:39.710
half two twists later in his program so

0:08:37.850,0:08:42.020
starting easy it was paid off for him

0:08:39.710,0:08:44.180
though seventy three point five decent

0:08:42.020,0:08:46.720
start for the Brazilian puts him in

0:08:44.180,0:08:50.060
equals second place now this man hasn't

0:08:46.720,0:08:54.500
Olympics for 12 years can the young oh

0:08:50.060,0:08:57.590
well done Kenny twenty nine years old

0:08:54.500,0:08:59.900
used to divert gates in myself and he is

0:08:57.590,0:09:01.820
certainly gonna be relying on that

0:08:59.900,0:09:03.320
wealth of experience of international

0:09:01.820,0:09:05.120
competition to see him through this

0:09:03.320,0:09:07.880
Paula Murray he's a very neat and tidy

0:09:05.120,0:09:09.620
diver should sneak over some points for

0:09:07.880,0:09:12.230
that one little bit of splash as he goes

0:09:09.620,0:09:14.270
in good board timing it's got Chinese

0:09:12.230,0:09:15.470
coaches to look after him or to put him

0:09:14.270,0:09:20.230
through his paces at his home in

0:09:15.470,0:09:24.560
Malaysia and here he is feeling seventy

0:09:20.230,0:09:26.690
1.30 yes mentioning he he was involved

0:09:24.560,0:09:28.600
in the diving competition in 2000 Sydney

0:09:26.690,0:09:32.270
hasn't competed at the Olympics since

0:09:28.600,0:09:34.130
his first Olympics in four for the

0:09:32.270,0:09:35.990
Malaysian now the second of the Germans

0:09:34.130,0:09:37.880
here's Patrick housing back two and a

0:09:35.990,0:09:42.200
half somersaults with Mike for his

0:09:37.880,0:09:43.730
opening gambit here's one to watch well

0:09:42.200,0:09:46.520
what a dive you're looking for the

0:09:43.730,0:09:48.770
vertical entry into the water and with

0:09:46.520,0:09:49.520
no splash that's exactly what the judges

0:09:48.770,0:09:51.440
are looking for

0:09:49.520,0:09:53.570
and that's exactly what Patrick is

0:09:51.440,0:09:55.370
delivered on his first round dive if he

0:09:53.570,0:09:58.700
gets over 70 points he keeps himself

0:09:55.370,0:10:02.800
well within the mix this is only 3.0 so

0:09:58.700,0:10:02.800
it needs to be good and it is just that

0:10:03.250,0:10:08.690
yeah I think it'd be happy with the

0:10:05.300,0:10:11.330
return on that all 872 for Patrick

0:10:08.690,0:10:13.190
housing give me a kiss to the friends

0:10:11.330,0:10:14.420
and family back home give them here I

0:10:13.190,0:10:15.860
think a lot of people in Europe

0:10:14.420,0:10:19.070
certainly have made the journey over to

0:10:15.860,0:10:21.890
London to support their divers and quite

0:10:19.070,0:10:25.640
a few for North America as well now from

0:10:21.890,0:10:26.779
the Ukraine here's Alexei trigger off in

0:10:25.640,0:10:30.089
with

0:10:26.779,0:10:32.370
the girls not messing around either he's

0:10:30.089,0:10:34.199
coming out all guns blazing it's a game

0:10:32.370,0:10:35.879
of tactics actually if you come out with

0:10:34.199,0:10:38.639
a big degree of difficulty which is

0:10:35.879,0:10:40.379
exactly what he's doing here and in word

0:10:38.639,0:10:42.569
three and a half we've seen one already

0:10:40.379,0:10:45.360
and he's nailed that one that's going to

0:10:42.569,0:10:47.300
get 83.4 degree of difficulties could

0:10:45.360,0:10:49.980
have put him high up on the leaderboard

0:10:47.300,0:10:51.480
speaking of boards he's not wise a safe

0:10:49.980,0:10:53.699
distance away from the diving board I

0:10:51.480,0:10:55.620
know lots of you at home like gasp every

0:10:53.699,0:10:58.740
time a diver comes near that's pretty

0:10:55.620,0:11:02.069
safe just 81 good good opening dive yeah

0:10:58.740,0:11:05.519
goes level with Kuznetsov of Russia that

0:11:02.069,0:11:07.350
opening dive now Xavier Garcia looking

0:11:05.519,0:11:09.149
to reach the semi-finals for the first

0:11:07.350,0:11:12.870
time always been knocked out in the

0:11:09.149,0:11:15.139
prelims both Beijing and in Athens back

0:11:12.870,0:11:19.379
two and a half for him to start with

0:11:15.139,0:11:20.970
well it's a good start from Xavier yeah

0:11:19.379,0:11:22.829
third Olympic Games he'll be looking to

0:11:20.970,0:11:27.569
progress further he's in good shape he's

0:11:22.829,0:11:29.610
been working hard so what can he do

0:11:27.569,0:11:31.980
today let's his opening dive his easiest

0:11:29.610,0:11:33.389
one little bit of discrepancy as you

0:11:31.980,0:11:36.139
went in though he should sneak seven and

0:11:33.389,0:11:38.879
a half's maybe even a couple of eights

0:11:36.139,0:11:40.290
sometimes a bit of a shaky start let's

0:11:38.879,0:11:41.069
see how he goes on with the rest of his

0:11:40.290,0:11:45.389
program

0:11:41.069,0:11:48.269
yeah judges concur with Leon 7.5 across

0:11:45.389,0:11:55.110
the board I'll give him a total just

0:11:48.269,0:11:57.179
outside top placings in 7th place now on

0:11:55.110,0:12:00.600
to the American and Chris Cole well

0:11:57.179,0:12:02.610
ain't that the champs in Rome back in

0:12:00.600,0:12:04.050
2009 9th here in February at the

0:12:02.610,0:12:07.050
competition that took place in this very

0:12:04.050,0:12:11.819
pool back to an hour some sorts with

0:12:07.050,0:12:14.129
Pike opening gambit for Cole Oh sneaky

0:12:11.819,0:12:16.110
it was nice looked like he was gonna

0:12:14.129,0:12:17.999
over rotate as he went in but very

0:12:16.110,0:12:19.920
cleverly saves the dive by bending

0:12:17.999,0:12:21.209
arching through the back bend in the

0:12:19.920,0:12:23.990
knees giving the impression that he's

0:12:21.209,0:12:28.439
completely vertical so a superb start

0:12:23.990,0:12:30.600
there for core well obviously knowing

0:12:28.439,0:12:31.679
exactly where he is in the air when

0:12:30.600,0:12:33.149
you're spinning backwards you could only

0:12:31.679,0:12:35.970
ever see where you've been so you have

0:12:33.149,0:12:38.870
to judge when to let go and Chris

0:12:35.970,0:12:41.930
showing his experience here 27 years old

0:12:38.870,0:12:45.380
and he got that down alright remember

0:12:41.930,0:12:47.810
just the top 18 from 29 started will go

0:12:45.380,0:12:49.280
through good opening gambit by Crisco or

0:12:47.810,0:12:53.090
72 for him

0:12:49.280,0:12:55.790
joins Patrick housing on that score to

0:12:53.090,0:13:02.210
mature or hace or France

0:12:55.790,0:13:04.430
oh nice very nice indeed it's a big dive

0:13:02.210,0:13:06.350
to start with and it's a tough one too

0:13:04.430,0:13:07.760
it's only three point three I personally

0:13:06.350,0:13:10.010
think you should be worth more than this

0:13:07.760,0:13:11.660
you're standing backwards he goes

0:13:10.010,0:13:14.960
swinging the arms one and a half twist

0:13:11.660,0:13:17.510
two and a half somersaults Wow and he

0:13:14.960,0:13:19.100
just a fantastic job on that entry

0:13:17.510,0:13:21.560
that's gonna put him top of the pile or

0:13:19.100,0:13:24.110
near his damn what a tie from the young

0:13:21.560,0:13:25.460
Frenchman well Jesse I'm finding it hard

0:13:24.110,0:13:26.600
to compute as a still waiting first

0:13:25.460,0:13:29.090
quarter comes through as you watch

0:13:26.600,0:13:30.500
another replay look at them spreading

0:13:29.090,0:13:32.420
the air right there with his hands and

0:13:30.500,0:13:34.330
causing that suction and the rip entry

0:13:32.420,0:13:37.280
looking at schools as the biggest so far

0:13:34.330,0:13:38.690
eighty four point one five for the

0:13:37.280,0:13:41.570
Frenchman can be delighted with that had

0:13:38.690,0:13:43.790
a very very good string of performances

0:13:41.570,0:13:45.980
in Shanghai last year I think it was

0:13:43.790,0:13:49.420
surprised to everybody now the young

0:13:45.980,0:13:53.210
Canadian Francois in Bordeaux Lackey

0:13:49.420,0:13:55.970
okay for 3.0 to open his campaign in

0:13:53.210,0:13:58.240
wood two and a half somersaults with

0:13:55.970,0:13:58.240
pike

0:14:04.329,0:14:10.249
yeah it's neat and tidy little bit maybe

0:14:08.329,0:14:11.869
lacking a little bit of strength on his

0:14:10.249,0:14:14.329
takeoff there some of the other divers

0:14:11.869,0:14:17.149
completing the dive more easily than

0:14:14.329,0:14:19.249
Francois squeezing into that Pike shape

0:14:17.149,0:14:21.800
if you just see there he didn't really

0:14:19.249,0:14:23.089
have a lot of drop time but it's still

0:14:21.800,0:14:26.959
straight up and down and you'll get

0:14:23.089,0:14:28.759
close to 70 points only 21 years old

0:14:26.959,0:14:29.329
first Olympic Games I've not seen him

0:14:28.759,0:14:31.910
dive before

0:14:29.329,0:14:32.899
69 for him this question is a bit of

0:14:31.910,0:14:34.670
facial hair there

0:14:32.899,0:14:37.579
swimmers tend to take everything off

0:14:34.670,0:14:41.839
body hair leg hair facial hair it's a

0:14:37.579,0:14:42.829
precursor for a good dive or not well as

0:14:41.839,0:14:44.959
long as you're impressing the judges

0:14:42.829,0:14:45.499
with your good looks that's all that

0:14:44.959,0:14:47.209
matters

0:14:45.499,0:14:49.670
that's why you didn't do any better than

0:14:47.209,0:14:51.019
you did Ilya Zakharov now with an inward

0:14:49.670,0:14:52.879
three and a half somersault we took

0:14:51.019,0:14:55.490
three point four degree of difficulty on

0:14:52.879,0:14:57.829
this yep Zakhar off is not messing

0:14:55.490,0:15:00.290
around either he's talked of any earlier

0:14:57.829,0:15:01.759
on in the vines and these boys are doing

0:15:00.290,0:15:03.559
their beach weights at home and they're

0:15:01.759,0:15:08.689
flexing their muscles today these are

0:15:03.559,0:15:11.480
big dives nowhere to go Wow cruising

0:15:08.689,0:15:13.339
that already complete competed here at

0:15:11.480,0:15:15.199
these games and he's gonna be strong

0:15:13.339,0:15:17.899
today this is going to get well over 80

0:15:15.199,0:15:21.319
points superb opening round dive to the

0:15:17.899,0:15:23.360
lead who is a lead by some way by five

0:15:21.319,0:15:26.179
points he's just checking on the scores

0:15:23.360,0:15:28.309
now just ahead of Ross 8 by a couple of

0:15:26.179,0:15:31.160
points but it is the lead for zakharov

0:15:28.309,0:15:33.079
eighty six point seven zero that's an

0:15:31.160,0:15:34.550
impressive way to start now he's a man

0:15:33.079,0:15:37.189
who a few weeks ago didn't even know if

0:15:34.550,0:15:39.860
he would be here or not explain why

0:15:37.189,0:15:42.829
after we've seen the first dive from

0:15:39.860,0:15:48.410
Alexandre de Partie it's a back two and

0:15:42.829,0:15:50.749
a half somersaults with Pike yeah Jesus

0:15:48.410,0:15:53.120
tipping over as he goes into the water

0:15:50.749,0:15:55.309
as you could imagine Alex with his

0:15:53.120,0:15:56.870
wealth of experience two Olympic medals

0:15:55.309,0:15:59.629
from the previous two games in this

0:15:56.870,0:16:01.549
event both of them silver technically

0:15:59.629,0:16:03.259
absolutely super many young divers

0:16:01.549,0:16:04.670
around the world watching this you

0:16:03.259,0:16:07.279
wouldn't go far wrong looking at

0:16:04.670,0:16:09.259
Alexander day parties technique but

0:16:07.279,0:16:11.509
everyone can make those slight errors of

0:16:09.259,0:16:13.370
judgment and Alex jurors tipping over a

0:16:11.509,0:16:15.470
vertical as he punches a hole here look

0:16:13.370,0:16:16.460
at that super slow-mo showing the air

0:16:15.470,0:16:19.220
being sucked

0:16:16.460,0:16:21.290
with the diver into the water now why

0:16:19.220,0:16:22.760
was the almost not here because he hit

0:16:21.290,0:16:24.890
his head on the diving board in

0:16:22.760,0:16:29.930
spectacular fashion in Rome a few weeks

0:16:24.890,0:16:32.420
before later on there was a real

0:16:29.930,0:16:34.340
question mark over as to whether he'd be

0:16:32.420,0:16:41.120
here or not he is here he is competing

0:16:34.340,0:16:43.040
as is Ilya Kovalchuk he's going for the

0:16:41.120,0:16:48.980
big dive to start with in the Tuck

0:16:43.040,0:16:51.080
position I should nails it as well now

0:16:48.980,0:16:53.270
I'm interested I'm interested to observe

0:16:51.080,0:16:55.100
and to watch the game of tactics being

0:16:53.270,0:16:57.500
played by both Russian divers and both

0:16:55.100,0:16:59.420
the Ukrainian divers all of them opting

0:16:57.500,0:17:01.700
for this opening dive which is tricky

0:16:59.420,0:17:03.620
it's complicated it's three point four

0:17:01.700,0:17:05.270
and if you get it right it puts you

0:17:03.620,0:17:08.120
straight up in the business end of the

0:17:05.270,0:17:09.709
field from vine 1 now what does that do

0:17:08.120,0:17:11.360
to your competitors when they're trying

0:17:09.709,0:17:14.240
to catch up I think it's a game of

0:17:11.360,0:17:16.610
tactics being well played yeah though

0:17:14.240,0:17:18.709
not quite as well executed as some

0:17:16.610,0:17:21.080
previous ones but still a decent mark as

0:17:18.709,0:17:22.640
it would be with the 3.4 degree of

0:17:21.080,0:17:29.200
difficulty seventy six point five zero

0:17:22.640,0:17:33.410
for kavaja yes Sebastian Gaston either

0:17:29.200,0:17:35.510
Colombia two and a half oh it's a nice

0:17:33.410,0:17:37.040
dive very precise you can see the

0:17:35.510,0:17:38.990
difference between the image three and a

0:17:37.040,0:17:40.160
half and the inward two and a half in

0:17:38.990,0:17:41.540
with three and a half there's a lot of

0:17:40.160,0:17:43.610
spins to get in the two and a half

0:17:41.540,0:17:47.810
opting for the pike position it's a lot

0:17:43.610,0:17:50.450
slow rotation it's very well placed but

0:17:47.810,0:17:52.520
when the guys are slotting in those big

0:17:50.450,0:17:54.110
big big degrees of difficulty you're

0:17:52.520,0:17:55.970
gonna be very hard to keep up with them

0:17:54.110,0:17:57.200
with such low degree of difficulty well

0:17:55.970,0:17:58.730
let's see what he has in the resumes

0:17:57.200,0:18:01.400
program to play catch-up cuz that's what

0:17:58.730,0:18:03.890
I have to do after that 72 for the

0:18:01.400,0:18:06.710
Colombian the big cheer greeting at the

0:18:03.890,0:18:09.740
arrival of the first of the two British

0:18:06.710,0:18:11.960
divers today and hopefully like we've

0:18:09.740,0:18:13.340
seen previous British divers do he'll

0:18:11.960,0:18:15.950
soak up some of the atmosphere before he

0:18:13.340,0:18:18.500
gets involved in his opening dive feel

0:18:15.950,0:18:20.540
be moving a weight from the end of the

0:18:18.500,0:18:22.880
diving board it's our back two and a

0:18:20.540,0:18:25.310
half sour sauce with pike Chris Meers

0:18:22.880,0:18:27.830
with Jack lure to come in a couple of

0:18:25.310,0:18:29.920
divers time 3.0 degree of difficulty in

0:18:27.830,0:18:33.410
the pike position

0:18:29.920,0:18:35.960
you're a superb start for the first of

0:18:33.410,0:18:37.670
team GP there's his mum and dad I've

0:18:35.960,0:18:40.160
obviously seen him compete already in

0:18:37.670,0:18:42.820
the 3-meter synchronized springboard

0:18:40.160,0:18:45.470
fantastic job coming fifth in that event

0:18:42.820,0:18:47.870
beautiful elevation squeezing into the

0:18:45.470,0:18:50.750
pike shape all-important entry into the

0:18:47.870,0:18:54.970
water tipping over a little bit nice

0:18:50.750,0:18:57.080
steady start from Chris Meers only 19

0:18:54.970,0:18:59.440
little better on the entry let's see

0:18:57.080,0:19:02.450
what the hearts for the judges maybe

0:18:59.440,0:19:05.420
seven point five six seven point five

0:19:02.450,0:19:10.870
zero Chris Meers reasonable start though

0:19:05.420,0:19:10.870
for him puts him in the decent order

0:19:12.370,0:19:18.950
Malaysia for three and a half oh it's

0:19:16.700,0:19:21.680
steady it's on his head little bit short

0:19:18.950,0:19:24.470
as he went into the water which is a

0:19:21.680,0:19:25.190
real shame this guy hates me but when he

0:19:24.470,0:19:27.410
was from China

0:19:25.190,0:19:29.270
now he's coaching in Malaysia and now

0:19:27.410,0:19:31.820
he's allowed to compete for them so he's

0:19:29.270,0:19:34.940
see the grand old age of 30 years old

0:19:31.820,0:19:37.310
but he still got it pretty good seven

0:19:34.940,0:19:42.800
7.5 maybe there could be a little bit

0:19:37.310,0:19:46.280
off the pace today marks are yeah 7.5 2

0:19:42.800,0:19:49.880
of them and a 7 so he opens up with a

0:19:46.280,0:19:56.870
total of 60 8.20

0:19:49.880,0:19:59.270
now great cheer to greet Jack lure from

0:19:56.870,0:20:01.070
a European Junior Champion made the

0:19:59.270,0:20:04.340
final in Shanghai last year and

0:20:01.070,0:20:07.010
acquitted himself very well indeed in

0:20:04.340,0:20:08.450
with two and a half somersaults 3.0 not

0:20:07.010,0:20:14.120
too high tariffs to so low for that

0:20:08.450,0:20:15.650
comes up later for Jack yeah he's been

0:20:14.120,0:20:17.800
diving well in training he won't be so

0:20:15.650,0:20:20.270
pleased without entry into the water

0:20:17.800,0:20:21.650
he's playing safe a little bit here Jack

0:20:20.270,0:20:23.420
does through the inward three and a half

0:20:21.650,0:20:25.910
but playing a game of tactics here

0:20:23.420,0:20:28.040
opening with her easier in which enough

0:20:25.910,0:20:30.770
he absolutely cruises it just come out a

0:20:28.040,0:20:32.510
little bit too early though the water

0:20:30.770,0:20:34.580
brushing gets the front side of his body

0:20:32.510,0:20:35.840
he's only going to get 7.5 that will put

0:20:34.580,0:20:37.370
him a little bit off the pace but I'm

0:20:35.840,0:20:41.390
very confident having watched him in

0:20:37.370,0:20:42.260
training that he will feature as we go

0:20:41.390,0:20:47.410
on

0:20:42.260,0:20:51.860
yeah reasonable opening offer from Jack

0:20:47.410,0:20:53.870
66 again 7.5 s and a 7 will count all

0:20:51.860,0:20:55.340
those marks with the line struck through

0:20:53.870,0:20:58.700
will not count remember none of these

0:20:55.340,0:21:03.620
marks carry through to the semis which

0:20:58.700,0:21:08.870
we on Tuesday morning local time now to

0:21:03.620,0:21:11.120
Stefano's a Patronus from greece oh it's

0:21:08.870,0:21:13.130
the finest probably one of the weakest

0:21:11.120,0:21:14.600
divers in this contest he's gonna really

0:21:13.130,0:21:18.290
need to be on the top of his game to

0:21:14.600,0:21:20.900
carry on through he's one of the the

0:21:18.290,0:21:22.970
younger generation of Greek divers so 22

0:21:20.900,0:21:25.070
years old it did very very well to make

0:21:22.970,0:21:27.140
these top 29 you were here today just

0:21:25.070,0:21:28.940
you see over vertical

0:21:27.140,0:21:30.710
just staying in his shape a little bit

0:21:28.940,0:21:32.330
too long as he goes into the water you

0:21:30.710,0:21:33.740
can see the splash moving away legs

0:21:32.330,0:21:35.510
coming apart a little bit he'll get

0:21:33.740,0:21:38.030
penalized for that there we go

0:21:35.510,0:21:40.100
why heavily so as well sixes from him

0:21:38.030,0:21:43.790
fifty four point zero zero if it gets

0:21:40.100,0:21:49.370
bored he loves reading his back Tomas or

0:21:43.790,0:21:52.970
Rinaldi next up for Italy and two

0:21:49.370,0:21:55.370
Italians are late in the program last of

0:21:52.970,0:21:57.200
the divers will be from Italy inward two

0:21:55.370,0:21:58.880
and a half somersaults height position

0:21:57.200,0:22:03.830
difficulty three points here and another

0:21:58.880,0:22:05.330
quite hirsute Italian today well it

0:22:03.830,0:22:07.070
looked a little bit like to the diving

0:22:05.330,0:22:08.720
boards he's always tricky getting the

0:22:07.070,0:22:10.010
distance correct on this inward movement

0:22:08.720,0:22:11.780
you're standing backwards on your

0:22:10.010,0:22:14.059
tiptoes you then need to swing your arms

0:22:11.780,0:22:17.150
jump up and away but spin forwards

0:22:14.059,0:22:18.650
towards the diving board he's okay I did

0:22:17.150,0:22:20.390
move back a little bit but he's okay

0:22:18.650,0:22:21.040
throwing up a little bit of splash shame

0:22:20.390,0:22:26.540
really

0:22:21.040,0:22:29.110
7.5 s incoming I would imagine gotta

0:22:26.540,0:22:29.110
give it the clap

0:22:31.010,0:22:37.200
seven point five and seven before

0:22:34.140,0:22:42.390
Renaldi and that's okay

0:22:37.200,0:22:46.020
not a bad start for him chin Kai for

0:22:42.390,0:22:48.750
China again just easing his way into the

0:22:46.020,0:22:50.340
program no big starter for him back two

0:22:48.750,0:22:55.530
and a half somersaults from the pike

0:22:50.340,0:22:58.320
position yet maybe the same as as he

0:22:55.530,0:23:00.720
Chong / Chong just playing a little bit

0:22:58.320,0:23:02.100
safe 3.0 to start the program I've seen

0:23:00.720,0:23:04.110
it much better than this in training

0:23:02.100,0:23:06.180
it's much better this is actually well

0:23:04.110,0:23:08.910
dare I say for the Chinese standard for

0:23:06.180,0:23:11.670
King Kai standard mediocre I wouldn't

0:23:08.910,0:23:15.120
give that more than an eighth maybe I'll

0:23:11.670,0:23:17.670
sneak 8.5 because of his distinguished

0:23:15.120,0:23:21.060
career and results previous results list

0:23:17.670,0:23:22.710
a little bit sure to vertical it is very

0:23:21.060,0:23:25.140
precise let's see what the judges seek

0:23:22.710,0:23:27.420
higher than I thought seventy six point

0:23:25.140,0:23:29.610
five zero we have said before they don't

0:23:27.420,0:23:31.590
we'll say again the Chinese invariably

0:23:29.610,0:23:34.470
are marked up on their dives because of

0:23:31.590,0:23:37.500
their reputations maybe that was a case

0:23:34.470,0:23:40.620
in the case in point there Troy do mate

0:23:37.500,0:23:42.270
will go with three point one so kind of

0:23:40.620,0:23:45.480
betwixt in between in terms of the

0:23:42.270,0:23:47.460
tariffs here on a forward three and a

0:23:45.480,0:23:51.620
half seller sorts with pike second of

0:23:47.460,0:23:51.620
the Americans to compete to think Oh

0:23:52.670,0:23:58.380
superb Troy the oldest competitor in

0:23:56.430,0:24:01.470
this contest as its coach Mack Scogin an

0:23:58.380,0:24:03.330
Olympian himself and absolutely drills

0:24:01.470,0:24:05.220
the entry let's check this out here we

0:24:03.330,0:24:07.620
go forward three and a half somersaults

0:24:05.220,0:24:10.710
in the pike position now you see me now

0:24:07.620,0:24:13.230
you don't what an entry this should get

0:24:10.710,0:24:15.330
the first nines of the contest and quite

0:24:13.230,0:24:17.220
right to Troy you know achieving a

0:24:15.330,0:24:19.980
lifetime dream of winning Olympic medal

0:24:17.220,0:24:21.330
earlier in the week and Wow well the

0:24:19.980,0:24:22.650
Americans are having a very good week I

0:24:21.330,0:24:25.320
think inspired by the fact that Greg

0:24:22.650,0:24:26.460
Louganis is here to mentor them and to

0:24:25.320,0:24:28.500
help them through and it seems to be

0:24:26.460,0:24:31.110
working dividends so of course the week

0:24:28.500,0:24:35.520
he goes into third place Troy to mate

0:24:31.110,0:24:37.650
after that time yeah Castillo welter as

0:24:35.520,0:24:39.270
it is on our sheet of paper here with a

0:24:37.650,0:24:42.090
forward two and a half somersaults two

0:24:39.270,0:24:45.000
twists pike three point four big one

0:24:42.090,0:24:47.400
or the crowd like that one as you could

0:24:45.000,0:24:50.160
imagine some winning arming it's a

0:24:47.400,0:24:51.390
pretty good dive for me out I taught you

0:24:50.160,0:24:52.860
through it as we go into the replay

0:24:51.390,0:24:54.150
hurdle set on the end little we're back

0:24:52.860,0:24:55.500
from the end here's one and a half

0:24:54.150,0:24:57.900
somersaults here's the double twist

0:24:55.500,0:24:58.260
super quick on the double twist yells

0:24:57.900,0:25:00.240
offs

0:24:58.260,0:25:02.220
normally all taped up he has terrible

0:25:00.240,0:25:04.110
problems with ankle injuries but today

0:25:02.220,0:25:06.450
he looks apart from some on his toes he

0:25:04.110,0:25:08.760
looks tape free which is a good sign

0:25:06.450,0:25:12.750
because this guy is an exciting diver

0:25:08.760,0:25:15.990
and when he's on he's on and he's on

0:25:12.750,0:25:18.090
joint first after that degree of

0:25:15.990,0:25:21.060
difficulty helping him up to a total of

0:25:18.090,0:25:23.430
eighty six point seven zero up there

0:25:21.060,0:25:29.250
with zakharov frankini get going here is

0:25:23.430,0:25:30.540
Robert Rodriguez or Venezuela he's done

0:25:29.250,0:25:32.820
okay on the entry into the water

0:25:30.540,0:25:35.850
probably a little recive as he went in

0:25:32.820,0:25:38.100
so ankle heavily strapped there these

0:25:35.850,0:25:39.840
guys on the springboard putting

0:25:38.100,0:25:42.000
themselves through their paces often

0:25:39.840,0:25:43.830
receive injuries to all different parts

0:25:42.000,0:25:45.510
of their body but the ankles do take a

0:25:43.830,0:25:47.580
kicking you looking to get really really

0:25:45.510,0:25:49.110
strong legs just skipping back from the

0:25:47.580,0:25:52.920
diamond board they're a little bit

0:25:49.110,0:25:54.420
aggressive on the way in see what judges

0:25:52.920,0:25:57.330
think were they're gonna give him my

0:25:54.420,0:25:59.460
favorite mark of 63 all the sevens times

0:25:57.330,0:26:03.660
three and that's how you arrive at the

0:25:59.460,0:26:05.730
total score for him 25th place at the

0:26:03.660,0:26:08.970
moment cause top 18 go through and last

0:26:05.730,0:26:12.660
of the divers in round one is another of

0:26:08.970,0:26:13.560
the Italians just those muscles McKinney

0:26:12.660,0:26:17.090
Benedetti

0:26:13.560,0:26:19.590
and we're two-and-a-half with Mike Oh

0:26:17.090,0:26:24.200
beautiful tie from the Italian to finish

0:26:19.590,0:26:26.400
up vine one Mickey missed out in Athens

0:26:24.200,0:26:28.140
didn't make the Italian team and then

0:26:26.400,0:26:29.640
again in Beijing it all looked good and

0:26:28.140,0:26:31.260
then he missed that again so this was

0:26:29.640,0:26:32.850
going to be his last-ditch effort to

0:26:31.260,0:26:35.100
make the games he was absolutely

0:26:32.850,0:26:37.200
thrilled to be on the team and that's

0:26:35.100,0:26:39.840
opening up his campaign in fine style

0:26:37.200,0:26:42.180
indeed rotten mickey Oh Mickey you're so

0:26:39.840,0:26:48.540
fine you're so fine you blow my mind hey

0:26:42.180,0:26:53.690
mickey 8.0 total arm 72

0:26:48.540,0:26:56.130
for Mikayla Ben Bethy and of round one

0:26:53.690,0:26:59.040
and what a competitive round it was if

0:26:56.130,0:27:00.900
that's only the prelims and is what the

0:26:59.040,0:27:04.800
same isn't the final gonna be like quota

0:27:00.900,0:27:07.530
and zakharov joint top looking their way

0:27:04.800,0:27:10.050
around down the board a great start for

0:27:07.530,0:27:12.510
Mattie Ross a in third place

0:27:10.050,0:27:15.420
all of those will become to be through

0:27:12.510,0:27:19.050
we stop right now as indeed most of them

0:27:15.420,0:27:22.470
on this page will be by down to the

0:27:19.050,0:27:24.390
Malaysian in 18th as yet no sign of the

0:27:22.470,0:27:27.300
Brits you have to wait for page number

0:27:24.390,0:27:30.120
three for them but sixty eight point two

0:27:27.300,0:27:32.400
is a qualification place and sixty seven

0:27:30.120,0:27:34.440
point five zero for Chris Meers 66 for

0:27:32.400,0:27:37.440
Jack lore and at the bottom was two

0:27:34.440,0:27:38.850
follows Petronas probably won't be

0:27:37.440,0:27:40.200
thinking about can we map from the

0:27:38.850,0:27:42.510
semi-finals at this stage but there's

0:27:40.200,0:27:47.640
still time to make up and repair the

0:27:42.510,0:27:50.010
damage great crowd in here again and the

0:27:47.640,0:27:51.870
Aquatic Centre for the diving very few

0:27:50.010,0:27:53.700
spare seats seventeen and a half

0:27:51.870,0:27:56.790
thousand or there abouts crammed in here

0:27:53.700,0:27:59.310
for every session of the diving and here

0:27:56.790,0:28:02.160
to support just the Brits but also the

0:27:59.310,0:28:04.350
world wide divers as well like the

0:28:02.160,0:28:05.790
Australian Ethan warrant Australian seen

0:28:04.350,0:28:08.040
a bit of a boost at the moment after the

0:28:05.790,0:28:09.480
week they've had in the Aquatic Centre

0:28:08.040,0:28:12.830
for three and a half summer sorts with

0:28:09.480,0:28:15.180
Pike 3.1 for his first second round dive

0:28:12.830,0:28:16.740
for his first second round dive that's

0:28:15.180,0:28:18.840
right yeah are you flew me a little bit

0:28:16.740,0:28:21.510
there I think you through Ethan ever so

0:28:18.840,0:28:23.610
slightly as well a little bit of a shaky

0:28:21.510,0:28:25.380
start first round second round a little

0:28:23.610,0:28:27.240
bit off the mark

0:28:25.380,0:28:29.550
just marginally but then diving comes

0:28:27.240,0:28:31.110
down to my G's short as he went in short

0:28:29.550,0:28:34.650
vertical it is still getting seven and a

0:28:31.110,0:28:36.600
half maybe squeezing an eighth but I've

0:28:34.650,0:28:38.040
seen Ethan diving better than this just

0:28:36.600,0:28:41.370
letting go of his legs a little bit

0:28:38.040,0:28:43.910
ambitiously a little bit early but yeah

0:28:41.370,0:28:46.440
I think there might be as parrots there

0:28:43.910,0:28:48.240
yeah just to clarify he is only doing

0:28:46.440,0:28:51.030
one second round dive and that was it

0:28:48.240,0:28:52.830
seventy two point eight five no

0:28:51.030,0:28:54.720
repechage here or anything in dive you

0:28:52.830,0:28:59.630
know get a second chance come back again

0:28:54.720,0:29:02.429
and same round Damien Sealy of France

0:28:59.630,0:29:03.869
19th after round one

0:29:02.429,0:29:05.369
this is a diamond competition in case

0:29:03.869,0:29:07.110
you think you have gone to the

0:29:05.369,0:29:09.990
bodybuilding exercises in with three and

0:29:07.110,0:29:13.019
a half service or we took 3.4 big degree

0:29:09.990,0:29:14.909
of difficulty I super-strong well you

0:29:13.019,0:29:16.769
can see how strong he is but he manages

0:29:14.909,0:29:19.309
to use the board very well 3-meter

0:29:16.769,0:29:22.789
springboard slot about rhythm timing

0:29:19.309,0:29:25.320
coordination strength power dynamic

0:29:22.789,0:29:26.730
explosive nature anyway he's got it all

0:29:25.320,0:29:28.499
going on he does make a little bit of a

0:29:26.730,0:29:30.450
botch on the end which is a real shame

0:29:28.499,0:29:32.249
he did all the hard work and then he

0:29:30.450,0:29:34.350
seems to go loose in there in his body

0:29:32.249,0:29:36.149
as he went into the water look at this

0:29:34.350,0:29:37.529
super slow motion see the dive is part

0:29:36.149,0:29:40.379
in their hands as they're trying to

0:29:37.529,0:29:43.649
escape into the water with absolutely no

0:29:40.379,0:29:47.340
splash it almost gets away with it

0:29:43.649,0:29:49.289
but not quite seventh and 6.5 where the

0:29:47.340,0:29:50.999
others discarded so total or when you

0:29:49.289,0:29:54.749
multiply it by the degree of difficulty

0:29:50.999,0:29:56.879
is 68 for him I'm smoking too many

0:29:54.749,0:30:00.779
mistakes from the man in ninth place

0:29:56.879,0:30:02.700
after round 1 a Chong of China world

0:30:00.779,0:30:04.740
champion Olympic champion three World

0:30:02.700,0:30:07.019
Series wins this year under his belt

0:30:04.740,0:30:12.269
forward two and a half seven salts and

0:30:07.019,0:30:17.340
two twists in the pipe position whoa

0:30:12.269,0:30:20.330
indeed the crowd a ruin and yesterday as

0:30:17.340,0:30:23.100
he addresses as soon as he goes in there

0:30:20.330,0:30:24.809
certainly no suit catastrophe as he went

0:30:23.100,0:30:26.610
in the water beautiful dive look how

0:30:24.809,0:30:28.889
high his way above the five meter

0:30:26.610,0:30:30.480
forward two and a half two twists he

0:30:28.889,0:30:32.940
makes it looks like it's a walk in the

0:30:30.480,0:30:35.669
park and I can assure you this is no

0:30:32.940,0:30:38.039
walk in the park this is that one of the

0:30:35.669,0:30:40.590
toughest dives that you can perform and

0:30:38.039,0:30:42.090
her Cheung just makes it look like it's

0:30:40.590,0:30:44.639
a beginner dive it makes makes it look

0:30:42.090,0:30:46.200
easy you could do that Bob oh yeah well

0:30:44.639,0:30:47.879
funny I was doing earlier today but they

0:30:46.200,0:30:51.119
didn't give me in the top 29-cent they

0:30:47.879,0:30:53.580
just missed out her Chong with eight

0:30:51.119,0:30:56.580
point five sand nines and the briefest

0:30:53.580,0:30:57.899
of reefs there is a mark suspense just

0:30:56.580,0:31:00.809
up the way in case he runs out of

0:30:57.899,0:31:02.309
underwear afghani Kuznets off where they

0:31:00.809,0:31:04.799
back three and a half summer suppose we

0:31:02.309,0:31:08.879
talk Wow we up to three point five this

0:31:04.799,0:31:11.190
is upping the stakes somewhat oh wow I

0:31:08.879,0:31:14.039
don't know what to say you give any is

0:31:11.190,0:31:15.629
coming out and he's got nowhere to hide

0:31:14.039,0:31:16.170
in fact none of his competitors have got

0:31:15.629,0:31:18.270
any way to

0:31:16.170,0:31:20.010
Jimmy carries on like this he's going to

0:31:18.270,0:31:23.220
be tough to keep up with even the two

0:31:20.010,0:31:25.170
chinese divers three point five and he's

0:31:23.220,0:31:27.480
buried it that's really good he'll get

0:31:25.170,0:31:28.350
or high 70s and i think he can do it

0:31:27.480,0:31:30.000
even better than that

0:31:28.350,0:31:31.560
lots of taping down his back but

0:31:30.000,0:31:34.140
obviously holding him together

0:31:31.560,0:31:37.080
goodbye afghan he's coming out there's a

0:31:34.140,0:31:42.960
revelation for you 77 for the russian

0:31:37.080,0:31:47.970
which puts him in second place daniel a

0:31:42.960,0:31:49.890
royal of mexico high tariffs dives here

0:31:47.970,0:31:51.600
three point five followed by a three

0:31:49.890,0:31:53.640
point four four two and a half

0:31:51.600,0:31:57.840
somersaults two twists in the pike

0:31:53.640,0:31:59.550
position almost got it down little bit

0:31:57.840,0:32:01.230
short as he went into the water

0:31:59.550,0:32:03.120
lots to fit in in this dive we've

0:32:01.230,0:32:04.650
already seen it from her chong just

0:32:03.120,0:32:07.350
earlier in the vines who absolutely

0:32:04.650,0:32:08.940
cruised it Daniel just showing us how

0:32:07.350,0:32:10.820
difficult it is Lance on the ending good

0:32:08.940,0:32:14.250
time double twist one and a half just

0:32:10.820,0:32:16.050
about scrapes it in it's good those high

0:32:14.250,0:32:18.780
degree of difficulty or get him over 70

0:32:16.050,0:32:22.020
points Wow and even the lower end of the

0:32:18.780,0:32:24.030
field are diving well again there are

0:32:22.020,0:32:27.300
some amazing performances today and some

0:32:24.030,0:32:28.890
amazing dives and that was not bad not

0:32:27.300,0:32:32.520
quite in the 8th range but seven point

0:32:28.890,0:32:37.440
five and a seven James get on with it

0:32:32.520,0:32:40.440
for three and a half here you go the

0:32:37.440,0:32:42.030
first calamity oh oh my goodness it's

0:32:40.440,0:32:44.190
silent in here sorry about that

0:32:42.030,0:32:46.440
I think he's okay I can talk you through

0:32:44.190,0:32:48.630
it what happened he landed on the end of

0:32:46.440,0:32:50.700
the diving board and his foot completely

0:32:48.630,0:32:52.740
slipped off the side he probably lost a

0:32:50.700,0:32:54.510
toenail or two there and therefore

0:32:52.740,0:32:56.190
completely look at this slips off the

0:32:54.510,0:32:57.810
side of the board doesn't get in his

0:32:56.190,0:32:59.400
flight ship only has hold of one later

0:32:57.810,0:33:02.610
looked a bit like the Isle of Man and

0:32:59.400,0:33:06.830
then absolutely smacks himself like he'd

0:33:02.610,0:33:09.810
just been slammed in wrestling he'll die

0:33:06.830,0:33:11.730
motocross support Stefan feck is out of

0:33:09.810,0:33:14.010
here yeah he will not be back tomorrow

0:33:11.730,0:33:15.510
because there's no marks attributed to

0:33:14.010,0:33:21.570
that dive because he didn't complete the

0:33:15.510,0:33:23.400
dive on to job Fitness waiter Oh yet

0:33:21.570,0:33:26.550
exactly the same time he just watched

0:33:23.400,0:33:28.380
his German counterpart there absolute

0:33:26.550,0:33:29.400
well it doesn't happen very often but he

0:33:28.380,0:33:30.720
just yeah

0:33:29.400,0:33:32.790
really feel for him anyway the

0:33:30.720,0:33:35.700
competition goes on there's still places

0:33:32.790,0:33:38.490
to be fought for and this young man he's

0:33:35.700,0:33:40.910
trying to keep his head keep his call

0:33:38.490,0:33:42.870
other divers will be aware of that

0:33:40.910,0:33:44.820
calamity that just took place with

0:33:42.870,0:33:47.070
Stefan there and he's certainly out of

0:33:44.820,0:33:49.380
it but this guy he's still in it the

0:33:47.070,0:33:50.490
venezuelan well that's the kind of mark

0:33:49.380,0:33:52.650
the Stefan effect wouldn't like to have

0:33:50.490,0:33:55.290
seen against his name rather zero zero

0:33:52.650,0:33:58.800
zero zero sixty eight point two zero it

0:33:55.290,0:34:01.230
is on that particular occasion Cesar

0:33:58.800,0:34:05.100
Castro our Brazil forward three and a

0:34:01.230,0:34:07.320
half with pike yet very tidy fun stays

0:34:05.100,0:34:08.909
up opened up with that beautiful first

0:34:07.320,0:34:10.950
round dive lower degree of difficulty

0:34:08.909,0:34:12.929
slowly starting to build now three point

0:34:10.950,0:34:15.300
one this one we've seen the previous

0:34:12.929,0:34:16.980
three divers do this one squeezing into

0:34:15.300,0:34:18.629
the pike shape just bending forward from

0:34:16.980,0:34:20.190
the hip keeping the legs straight he's

0:34:18.629,0:34:21.720
tired he maybe lose his feet a little

0:34:20.190,0:34:27.450
bit as he goes in there this look at

0:34:21.720,0:34:29.639
eight keep him in the mix it is gonna be

0:34:27.450,0:34:31.409
so tight for those top 18 places I tell

0:34:29.639,0:34:33.240
you already it's developing into a

0:34:31.409,0:34:37.200
contest where there will be few marks

0:34:33.240,0:34:45.560
separating the time is around the 15 to

0:34:37.200,0:34:47.850
20 mark kimi yo oh it's good

0:34:45.560,0:34:49.500
probably needed to come mind a little

0:34:47.850,0:34:51.120
bit more on the dive there to give the

0:34:49.500,0:34:52.950
impression of being completely vertical

0:34:51.120,0:34:54.510
aerial work is good here we are

0:34:52.950,0:34:55.889
squeezing into the pike out here's the

0:34:54.510,0:34:57.950
double twist maybe out a little bit

0:34:55.889,0:35:00.090
early leaving himself a little bit to do

0:34:57.950,0:35:01.710
marginally short but that look at eight

0:35:00.090,0:35:03.930
if you get an eight you're gonna go

0:35:01.710,0:35:05.970
close to 80 points and if you're on 80

0:35:03.930,0:35:09.570
points that's where exactly you need to

0:35:05.970,0:35:11.700
be eighty one point six zero to be

0:35:09.570,0:35:14.310
precise weaken the yoke and that will

0:35:11.700,0:35:18.200
help his charge up the table quite a bit

0:35:14.310,0:35:21.330
he's in third place now binder Chong and

0:35:18.200,0:35:22.860
Kuznetsov Patrick housing hopes the same

0:35:21.330,0:35:24.710
fate won't befall him as his German

0:35:22.860,0:35:27.890
teammate

0:35:24.710,0:35:29.900
oh it's a good dive now maybe the judges

0:35:27.890,0:35:31.760
will see this or maybe it's just for us

0:35:29.900,0:35:33.500
on the replay I think Patrick was a

0:35:31.760,0:35:35.690
little bit twisted as he went in landed

0:35:33.500,0:35:37.190
on the corner of the diving board still

0:35:35.690,0:35:39.290
manages to do a good job you can see his

0:35:37.190,0:35:40.849
head there just looking everywhere every

0:35:39.290,0:35:42.440
summer stop but I could see both feet as

0:35:40.849,0:35:44.630
he goes in which means he's a little bit

0:35:42.440,0:35:46.339
over twisted penny judges give him less

0:35:44.630,0:35:48.470
than a seven they would have seen that

0:35:46.339,0:35:53.660
but of course the judges do not get the

0:35:48.470,0:35:56.390
replay no they've missed it lucky yeah

0:35:53.660,0:35:56.720
it got away with that one and because of

0:35:56.390,0:35:58.250
it

0:35:56.720,0:36:00.079
he's got seventy two point eight five

0:35:58.250,0:36:04.819
which will put him in the top five I

0:36:00.079,0:36:07.550
likes a plug or off of Ukraine three

0:36:04.819,0:36:11.930
point eight stand by forward four and a

0:36:07.550,0:36:14.329
half somersaults Oh stand by hold on

0:36:11.930,0:36:16.670
take your hats off he did very well

0:36:14.329,0:36:18.290
indeed they're the hurdle step the

0:36:16.670,0:36:20.450
approach to the end didn't do him any

0:36:18.290,0:36:22.579
favors he had one foot slightly off the

0:36:20.450,0:36:26.329
side of the board this is three point

0:36:22.579,0:36:27.859
eight and he sneaks it in nicely you'll

0:36:26.329,0:36:30.170
get seventh on that look at where he

0:36:27.859,0:36:31.940
lands and then he shoots forward that's

0:36:30.170,0:36:34.190
way too far away from the diving board

0:36:31.940,0:36:37.790
but wow what a diver to be able to

0:36:34.190,0:36:39.140
control that when your takeoff is medium

0:36:37.790,0:36:42.470
too poor Wow

0:36:39.140,0:36:44.240
good work three point eight those marks

0:36:42.470,0:36:45.619
along the bottom which is not allowing

0:36:44.240,0:36:47.359
on the screen for very long sorry we

0:36:45.619,0:36:49.970
can't take it all in but eighty three

0:36:47.359,0:36:53.329
point six it was we go on to Garcia yeah

0:36:49.970,0:36:55.460
good work from javi not waiting around

0:36:53.329,0:36:57.890
not giving us any time to go too much

0:36:55.460,0:36:59.690
into the detail they see these dives are

0:36:57.890,0:37:01.700
so difficult I don't know where to start

0:36:59.690,0:37:03.319
all he did lose his legs a little bit

0:37:01.700,0:37:05.690
there that's very clear on the replay

0:37:03.319,0:37:08.599
you probably wouldn't see that when you

0:37:05.690,0:37:10.309
watch it for the first time double twist

0:37:08.599,0:37:13.160
super slo-mo cam just showing the

0:37:10.309,0:37:14.990
strains on the divers lots of photos on

0:37:13.160,0:37:17.359
the internet of divers faces close-up

0:37:14.990,0:37:20.559
mid dive the slow-motion giving you an

0:37:17.359,0:37:20.559
impression that's good from javi

0:37:21.130,0:37:28.210
and 70 6.50 smile on the face of Crisco

0:37:25.720,0:37:29.740
well I said I was really enjoying

0:37:28.210,0:37:31.660
themselves here enjoying themselves in

0:37:29.740,0:37:34.600
competition I'm mostly hoping that they

0:37:31.660,0:37:37.450
go e returning for the semi files in

0:37:34.600,0:37:40.300
about 14 hours time for three and a half

0:37:37.450,0:37:41.650
somersaults with pike if a go well 3.1

0:37:40.300,0:37:46.900
degree of difficulty have a mere

0:37:41.650,0:37:48.670
Bagatelle compared to that 3.8 yea 3.1

0:37:46.900,0:37:50.500
but if you're going to execute it with

0:37:48.670,0:37:52.780
that much precision it's going to work

0:37:50.500,0:37:55.800
for you Cristie nips and their buns

0:37:52.780,0:37:58.090
medalist in the three metre synchro

0:37:55.800,0:38:00.010
supporting his teammate here Chris doing

0:37:58.090,0:38:01.990
a beautiful job quite tall for a dive up

0:38:00.010,0:38:03.250
so he looks very elegant as he's

0:38:01.990,0:38:05.350
spinning around in the shapes a little

0:38:03.250,0:38:07.210
back from the end but that's straight up

0:38:05.350,0:38:10.930
and down that'll get or eight eight and

0:38:07.210,0:38:13.780
a half's good it's a good dive yeah

0:38:10.930,0:38:16.360
anything in the mid 70s and high up is a

0:38:13.780,0:38:18.790
good dive and that's when he gets

0:38:16.360,0:38:21.220
seventy five point nine five a core well

0:38:18.790,0:38:22.810
now we had an impressive start from

0:38:21.220,0:38:25.330
météo row say ah

0:38:22.810,0:38:28.210
France can he back it up three point

0:38:25.330,0:38:32.310
four degree of difficulty on this inward

0:38:28.210,0:38:32.310
three and a half summer sorts with tuck

0:38:33.750,0:38:38.680
he can't back it up I think you just

0:38:36.160,0:38:39.760
piled that well the commentators curse

0:38:38.680,0:38:41.920
right there Bob

0:38:39.760,0:38:43.150
opening round dive put him in the top

0:38:41.920,0:38:44.500
what top four

0:38:43.150,0:38:46.060
where was he after the first round

0:38:44.500,0:38:48.670
incredible now just showing you how

0:38:46.060,0:38:51.400
difficult these dives are very easy to

0:38:48.670,0:38:53.080
get lost get confused spinning around so

0:38:51.400,0:38:54.340
quickly your eyes are being pulled back

0:38:53.080,0:38:56.440
loads of g-forces

0:38:54.340,0:39:01.060
what a shame because the aerial work was

0:38:56.440,0:39:02.560
fantastic and Oh see ya yeah has a chat

0:39:01.060,0:39:05.770
with his coach but you can't get that

0:39:02.560,0:39:07.600
one back I'm afraid fours and 4.5 that

0:39:05.770,0:39:09.670
really has dented his chances are

0:39:07.600,0:39:13.420
returning tomorrow but that first round

0:39:09.670,0:39:19.180
dive still has a decent chance Francois

0:39:13.420,0:39:22.570
in bull du Lac before Canada you got a

0:39:19.180,0:39:24.220
raw recruit reader Canadian diving four

0:39:22.570,0:39:26.590
or three and our service orts with pike

0:39:24.220,0:39:29.730
three point one the degree of difficulty

0:39:26.590,0:39:29.730
attached to this one

0:39:30.700,0:39:35.000
Royce ended up okay in the end I don't

0:39:33.530,0:39:36.650
know whether you saw the same thing as

0:39:35.000,0:39:38.600
me as he came into the end I wasn't sure

0:39:36.650,0:39:40.730
which direction he was gonna end up

0:39:38.600,0:39:42.710
facing it seemed to drift a little bit

0:39:40.730,0:39:44.630
in the air like it was windy anyway he

0:39:42.710,0:39:47.720
got it together in the end forward three

0:39:44.630,0:39:50.240
and a half Pike you know he's he's not

0:39:47.720,0:39:52.130
as dynamic or as strong as some of the

0:39:50.240,0:39:54.710
other divers so he's never gonna get

0:39:52.130,0:39:57.800
more than a 7 7.5 - he's not finishing

0:39:54.710,0:39:59.300
the dive high enough but still 21 years

0:39:57.800,0:40:03.530
old where was he going well going

0:39:59.300,0:40:07.430
sideways it did seem that way marks were

0:40:03.530,0:40:09.290
ok not overly impressive for him 60 5.10

0:40:07.430,0:40:12.230
that's gonna take a little bit of dent

0:40:09.290,0:40:14.960
in terms of his position in the table in

0:40:12.230,0:40:18.560
here zakharov back three and a half some

0:40:14.960,0:40:22.250
sorts 3.50

0:40:18.560,0:40:23.810
super smooth now these medals are going

0:40:22.250,0:40:26.060
to be highly contested and they've got a

0:40:23.810,0:40:28.340
long way to go yet but if you're a

0:40:26.060,0:40:32.330
betting man or lady and you're watching

0:40:28.340,0:40:34.760
this this guy is worth a punt beautiful

0:40:32.330,0:40:37.580
dive this is so tricky 3.5 that's going

0:40:34.760,0:40:39.290
to get way over 80 points Wow

0:40:37.580,0:40:41.600
he's putting the pressure on the Chinese

0:40:39.290,0:40:43.430
well he was second in Shanghai but the

0:40:41.600,0:40:45.980
Chinese last year because they were 1 in

0:40:43.430,0:40:50.090
3 and he was second in Shanghai and the

0:40:45.980,0:40:53.690
way started here you would not bet not

0:40:50.090,0:40:56.300
being in that position again 84 - very

0:40:53.690,0:40:57.770
solid Ives eighty six point seven and 84

0:40:56.300,0:41:02.750
to start with reversed two and a half

0:40:57.770,0:41:05.390
won a half twist examiner de Partie just

0:41:02.750,0:41:08.390
showing his skill landing way back from

0:41:05.390,0:41:10.400
the end of the diving board I shifted

0:41:08.390,0:41:12.230
back in my chair I wasn't happy look at

0:41:10.400,0:41:14.240
that way back from the end has to reach

0:41:12.230,0:41:15.740
up and over the diving board if he

0:41:14.240,0:41:17.900
wasn't so skilled he'd have been a lot

0:41:15.740,0:41:19.490
closer to the diving board there of

0:41:17.900,0:41:21.350
course a few weeks ago hitting his head

0:41:19.490,0:41:23.960
on the diving board on a different dive

0:41:21.350,0:41:25.490
- this one anyway safe distance away in

0:41:23.960,0:41:31.360
the end it's only gonna get seven and a

0:41:25.490,0:41:34.820
half's it's okay he's okay yeah 7.5 Alex

0:41:31.360,0:41:36.620
perhaps still not quite in the shape we

0:41:34.820,0:41:38.660
don't expect to see him in terms of his

0:41:36.620,0:41:40.820
quality of diving three point three

0:41:38.660,0:41:42.730
degree of difficulty on that so

0:41:40.820,0:41:47.000
helped him a little bit bit of a buffer

0:41:42.730,0:41:48.950
Ilya Vasa 3.8 dive again the big tariffs

0:41:47.000,0:41:53.780
early from the Ukraine and Russia Ford

0:41:48.950,0:41:56.810
four and a half oh nice nice very good

0:41:53.780,0:41:58.610
commercia Wow I wish I could describe to

0:41:56.810,0:42:00.020
you how difficult this dive actually is

0:41:58.610,0:42:03.530
because the two you've seen so far have

0:42:00.020,0:42:05.570
been absolutely spot on forward four and

0:42:03.530,0:42:07.070
a half hanging on to those shins bending

0:42:05.570,0:42:08.750
at the ankles and at the knees just

0:42:07.070,0:42:10.790
squeezing into that tight ball

0:42:08.750,0:42:14.080
this could get 90 points that's

0:42:10.790,0:42:16.580
absolutely stunning what a dive

0:42:14.080,0:42:18.920
obviously the tape helping I need to get

0:42:16.580,0:42:20.680
some tape on yeah you do but make sure

0:42:18.920,0:42:24.560
it's the right tape this time please

0:42:20.680,0:42:27.200
ninety one point two zero for kavaja he

0:42:24.560,0:42:29.540
goes into second place minders ekor off

0:42:27.200,0:42:32.200
and they really are front-loading their

0:42:29.540,0:42:36.260
dives here the high tariffs early on

0:42:32.200,0:42:38.480
giving them the early advantage yeah

0:42:36.260,0:42:40.190
he's looking to get rid of his dives not

0:42:38.480,0:42:42.410
get rid of them so I get them done very

0:42:40.190,0:42:45.040
very quickly as soon as the referee

0:42:42.410,0:42:47.120
gives you permission where you go

0:42:45.040,0:42:50.870
forward three and a half in the pike

0:42:47.120,0:42:54.320
position yeah it's it's tough to follow

0:42:50.870,0:42:57.020
such a big scoring dive it'll get sevens

0:42:54.320,0:43:01.250
I think sevens is going to cook it in

0:42:57.020,0:43:06.710
this kind of competition sevens it is

0:43:01.250,0:43:11.690
and that gives you a total of sixty five

0:43:06.710,0:43:16.160
point one zero forecast Anita just me is

0:43:11.690,0:43:18.470
enjoying its preamble Prelude if you

0:43:16.160,0:43:20.030
like his second round dive which is a

0:43:18.470,0:43:22.850
reverse two and a half somersaults with

0:43:20.030,0:43:25.160
Mike just on the cusp of qualification

0:43:22.850,0:43:29.270
after round one three more formal rounds

0:43:25.160,0:43:30.920
after this nice really really good I was

0:43:29.270,0:43:33.860
listening to the crowd of those Tom

0:43:30.920,0:43:35.810
Daley Sarah Barrow Peter Waterfield all

0:43:33.860,0:43:39.470
of them here to support their teammates

0:43:35.810,0:43:41.900
Chris Meers only 19 years old beautiful

0:43:39.470,0:43:46.130
reverse two-and-half needed it needs to

0:43:41.900,0:43:48.380
go over 70 points and that will holding

0:43:46.130,0:43:52.010
his nerves smiling enjoying this

0:43:48.380,0:43:54.440
occasion inspired by performances so far

0:43:52.010,0:43:56.060
into the hot tub to keep warm

0:43:54.440,0:44:00.319
and then straight back out into the

0:43:56.060,0:44:02.540
call-off area good go good good 3 8 72

0:44:00.319,0:44:05.690
he'll be happy with that and that will

0:44:02.540,0:44:13.970
move him up the table by a mark or two

0:44:05.690,0:44:17.450
in a position or two as well Malaysia

0:44:13.970,0:44:19.609
are back two and a half or just a little

0:44:17.450,0:44:22.099
bit off his game as short as he entered

0:44:19.609,0:44:23.540
the water every work was ok I think he

0:44:22.099,0:44:25.700
just came out of the dive a little bit

0:44:23.540,0:44:28.569
too ambitious Lee a little bit too early

0:44:25.700,0:44:31.069
we shall cost him you'll only get 7s

0:44:28.569,0:44:32.150
there we are just needed to hang on a

0:44:31.069,0:44:33.950
little bit longer than the water

0:44:32.150,0:44:38.990
wouldn't have smacked him on the back of

0:44:33.950,0:44:41.119
the legs as he went in there we go next

0:44:38.990,0:44:43.700
up Jack no I could already hear the

0:44:41.119,0:44:48.410
crowd shouting and cheering there's too

0:44:43.700,0:44:52.750
much low fourth Wong first and his total

0:44:48.410,0:44:52.750
as they take it off the screen for you

0:44:52.900,0:45:00.800
was 63 exactly now this man's hero is

0:44:58.040,0:45:04.810
Usain Bolt oh it's probably be by what

0:45:00.800,0:45:04.810
he saw on the track last night jack

0:45:05.410,0:45:11.569
pretty inspired looks a little shaky out

0:45:09.920,0:45:14.780
there for Jackie's got so much home

0:45:11.569,0:45:16.190
support yeah I've seen it better than

0:45:14.780,0:45:18.589
this he's right on the corner of the

0:45:16.190,0:45:20.359
diving board he does really well not to

0:45:18.589,0:45:23.839
end up in the middle of the pool doing a

0:45:20.359,0:45:25.910
Stephen feck but he manages to hang on

0:45:23.839,0:45:27.589
there even with a poor takeoff and look

0:45:25.910,0:45:29.900
at the strain and effort going into this

0:45:27.589,0:45:31.190
one and a half twist into the 1 and a

0:45:29.900,0:45:33.410
half to us into the two and a half

0:45:31.190,0:45:35.690
somersaults he squares it up nicely on

0:45:33.410,0:45:40.609
the end but that was a poor takeoff well

0:45:35.690,0:45:43.550
done jack staying with it sevens and 7.5

0:45:40.609,0:45:47.900
it's gonna put him right around the 18

0:45:43.550,0:45:49.910
on 19 position 29th and I played frayed

0:45:47.900,0:45:51.740
at the bottom and likely to remain there

0:45:49.910,0:45:54.230
unless things improved greatly mister

0:45:51.740,0:45:58.359
pentose a Patronus forward three and a

0:45:54.230,0:46:00.920
half Oh beautiful entry into the water

0:45:58.359,0:46:04.030
we're talking about the repente tree and

0:46:00.920,0:46:06.109
that was an ideal example of one

0:46:04.030,0:46:08.440
punching a water with a flat hand

0:46:06.109,0:46:12.640
ripping the hands aside as he goes here

0:46:08.440,0:46:14.589
I was causing a vacuum just disappear as

0:46:12.640,0:46:16.300
he went in could work from the young

0:46:14.589,0:46:17.619
Greek diver well of course he can't

0:46:16.300,0:46:20.020
village bottom because that will go to

0:46:17.619,0:46:21.520
Stefan feck after that failed dive so he

0:46:20.020,0:46:22.960
will have moved on position anyway

0:46:21.520,0:46:26.200
that's me I'll have a few positions

0:46:22.960,0:46:31.900
that's far up to 21st to phallus a

0:46:26.200,0:46:34.359
Patronus of greece i want to tomas over

0:46:31.900,0:46:35.859

0:46:46.599,0:46:51.040
from an audience member

0:46:47.829,0:46:53.650
divers in as soon as the whistle is

0:46:51.040,0:46:57.130
blown by the referee that is the sign to

0:46:53.650,0:46:59.020
the audience to to keep stun and someone

0:46:57.130,0:47:02.200
decided to share it Tommaso unfazed by

0:46:59.020,0:47:03.640
it the dives okay it's why it's good

0:47:02.200,0:47:06.579
actually but in this level of

0:47:03.640,0:47:12.790
competition it goes down to okay seven

0:47:06.579,0:47:14.319
7.5 s yep sevens it will be times a

0:47:12.790,0:47:16.690
degree of difficulty three point one

those marks on your left with the line

0:47:16.690,0:47:20.710
struck through do not count towards the

0:47:18.579,0:47:22.329
total score sure you know that by now we

0:47:20.710,0:47:23.859
get new views all the time who need to

0:47:22.329,0:47:26.109
know that forward two and a half

0:47:23.859,0:47:29.310
somersaults two twists for Ching Kai of

0:47:26.109,0:47:32.410
China 3.4 degree of difficulty on this

0:47:29.310,0:47:35.770
it's very good it's tidy it's precise

0:47:32.410,0:47:38.470
chin kind not looking like him like he's

0:47:35.770,0:47:40.450
for myself I must admit the Russians are

0:47:38.470,0:47:42.910
certainly taking it to him and I think

0:47:40.450,0:47:45.790
that that might move him up a little bit

0:47:42.910,0:47:48.670
from 7th but not a whole lot it's good

0:47:45.790,0:47:50.470
it'll get 8 in fact it is a very good

0:47:48.670,0:47:52.690
dive for this first round I've left him

0:47:50.470,0:47:57.369
off the case a little bit off the pace

0:47:52.690,0:47:58.690
and off the case sure it's gonna be a

0:47:57.369,0:48:01.990
long competition it could be a very

0:47:58.690,0:48:03.430
brief case actually but they would be

0:48:01.990,0:48:05.950
alright for so many files I'm sure

0:48:03.430,0:48:08.290
alright for the finalists were 85 for

0:48:05.950,0:48:10.960
Ching Kai again maybe ever marked a

0:48:08.290,0:48:14.260
little bit there but that's the way the

0:48:10.960,0:48:14.950
judges saw it Troy do you may do a very

0:48:14.260,0:48:16.720
good start

0:48:14.950,0:48:18.790
can he back it up three point three

0:48:16.720,0:48:21.080
degree of difficulty on this reverse two

0:48:18.790,0:48:25.640
and a half somersaults 1/2 twists

0:48:21.080,0:48:29.690
formed in the pikey position unwavering

0:48:25.640,0:48:33.110
yes he can back it up yeah very very

0:48:29.690,0:48:35.450
solid all about consistency and Troy to

0:48:33.110,0:48:38.600
me is certainly displaying that out here

0:48:35.450,0:48:41.390
today obviously on a high for winning an

0:48:38.600,0:48:43.370
Olympic medal last week and so he should

0:48:41.390,0:48:45.620
be eight to eight point five s will it

0:48:43.370,0:48:47.510
get eighty points if it does he'll

0:48:45.620,0:48:49.160
certainly be very much up in the

0:48:47.510,0:48:52.370
business end of the field after round

0:48:49.160,0:48:54.320
two I think to clarify for you if you

0:48:52.370,0:48:56.300
saw the women's on the previous couple

0:48:54.320,0:48:58.940
of days then you may have seen five

0:48:56.300,0:49:03.410
rounds the women's is five the men's is

0:48:58.940,0:49:08.300
six so we'll be halfway at the end of

0:49:03.410,0:49:09.730
the next round round three round two

0:49:08.300,0:49:14.390
well into round two now

0:49:09.730,0:49:15.740
Hale guess deal well de Mexico in with

0:49:14.390,0:49:20.650
three and a half seven sorts would tuck

0:49:15.740,0:49:20.650
joint leader after the first round

0:49:21.820,0:49:27.290
yeah that's going to keep him certainly

0:49:25.040,0:49:28.760
in the top half of the field and that's

0:49:27.290,0:49:31.310
what it's all about this morning three

0:49:28.760,0:49:33.200
point four degree of difficulty yes

0:49:31.310,0:49:34.940
maybe moving his hips back a little bit

0:49:33.200,0:49:36.770
before he takes off so he's just a

0:49:34.940,0:49:38.420
little low on the water but you're

0:49:36.770,0:49:41.060
looking for that vertical entry and

0:49:38.420,0:49:43.790
anything close to 80 points is exactly

0:49:41.060,0:49:45.860
what you're looking for and I'm sure

0:49:43.790,0:49:48.830
y'all will be there yet they like it

0:49:45.860,0:49:51.590
though there are the coaches eighty one

0:49:48.830,0:49:53.900
point six zero and that will keep him

0:49:51.590,0:49:55.580
right close to the top if not quite at

0:49:53.900,0:49:59.480
the top anymore he's in second place

0:49:55.580,0:50:06.350
behind Kinnear zakharov is a Rodriguez

0:49:59.480,0:50:08.090
for three and a half going in the wrong

0:50:06.350,0:50:10.430
direction to start with he seemed to

0:50:08.090,0:50:11.930
place his first foot very close to the

0:50:10.430,0:50:14.300
end and then drift backwards that's

0:50:11.930,0:50:15.920
obviously a slight error but he manages

0:50:14.300,0:50:17.540
to look way back from the end of the

0:50:15.920,0:50:19.250
springboard that's not very springy back

0:50:17.540,0:50:21.200
there and you need to be right on the

0:50:19.250,0:50:22.820
end obviously not over the end we see

0:50:21.200,0:50:24.050
what happens when you know you've got

0:50:22.820,0:50:28.750
your feet over the end of the diving

0:50:24.050,0:50:28.750
board anyway Robert survives

0:50:29.329,0:50:33.720
let's see what marks again happier

0:50:31.410,0:50:35.519
worried again there that's what most

0:50:33.720,0:50:38.519
certain other calamity waiting to happen

0:50:35.519,0:50:40.130
6.5 s across the board sixty point four

0:50:38.519,0:50:42.569
five not going to help him a great deal

0:50:40.130,0:50:45.839
Kelly Ben Betty wants to go and he is

0:50:42.569,0:50:47.549
going oh it's beautiful entry into the

0:50:45.839,0:50:50.970
water a little bit of short vertical as

0:50:47.549,0:50:55.289
he goes in make you would ilanic wanted

0:50:50.970,0:50:57.240
to yeah he's warming up his legs to to

0:50:55.289,0:50:59.519
go that here we are here's the replay

0:50:57.240,0:51:01.829
squeezing into the Pike shape or just

0:50:59.519,0:51:03.390
crimping his knees slightly there to

0:51:01.829,0:51:05.279
make the rotations a little bit easier

0:51:03.390,0:51:06.990
that's actually a little bit off way

0:51:05.279,0:51:08.819
needs but he's right on the corner as

0:51:06.990,0:51:11.339
well it's so tricky as you're as a

0:51:08.819,0:51:12.660
springboard diver to to land on the end

0:51:11.339,0:51:15.690
of the diving board it seems this

0:51:12.660,0:51:17.220
evening they're going in all kinds of

0:51:15.690,0:51:18.749
directions are they like if they've all

0:51:17.220,0:51:20.609
been in the pub before this one I doubt

0:51:18.749,0:51:21.740
it very much so we put goose grease on

0:51:20.609,0:51:24.900
the end of the board or something

0:51:21.740,0:51:26.490
slipping off it's amazing what's

0:51:24.900,0:51:28.170
happened in this competition that's why

0:51:26.490,0:51:28.890
we already had two rounds and four more

0:51:28.170,0:51:30.690
still to come

0:51:28.890,0:51:32.789
Ilya Zakharov want to start from him

0:51:30.690,0:51:35.309
watch that boy he could be very very

0:51:32.789,0:51:38.160
dangerous indeed already is yeah el

0:51:35.309,0:51:40.769
castillo welter kavaja of ukraine

0:51:38.160,0:51:42.680
ukraine three and four USA five chinese

0:51:40.769,0:51:44.849
six and seven that's a surprise

0:51:42.680,0:51:47.249
Chris Meers a snuck into the top

0:51:44.849,0:51:49.349
eighteen as has Jack law so Jack loss

0:51:47.249,0:51:51.569
stays there in four rounds time he and

0:51:49.349,0:51:54.869
Chris Mears will be progressing into the

0:51:51.569,0:51:56.970
semi files these on the last page and

0:51:54.869,0:51:58.940
why they got too much to do or might as

0:51:56.970,0:52:01.410
well forget it including Stefan Peck

0:51:58.940,0:52:02.910
sadly is there what sixty points adrift

0:52:01.410,0:52:08.670
of everybody else after that failed

0:52:02.910,0:52:11.190
second round dive it's been a very

0:52:08.670,0:52:11.700
intriguing and entertaining competition

0:52:11.190,0:52:13.559
so far

0:52:11.700,0:52:14.989
if you need all the twists and turns

0:52:13.559,0:52:17.730
that we weren't expecting and the

0:52:14.989,0:52:20.910
Chinese further down the pecking order

0:52:17.730,0:52:22.170
that we had imagined that's because some

0:52:20.910,0:52:24.839
people have front loaded their dives

0:52:22.170,0:52:26.160
here with very big tariffs that's right

0:52:24.839,0:52:28.410
the Chinese still have their highest

0:52:26.160,0:52:30.690
degrees of difficulty still to come and

0:52:28.410,0:52:33.619
of course it's about six dives and not

0:52:30.690,0:52:38.390
two let's say third of the way through

0:52:33.619,0:52:40.869
big third round dive for Ethan Warren

0:52:38.390,0:52:43.480
it's a three point eight

0:52:40.869,0:52:45.430
Ward four-and-a-half lot of risk but on

0:52:43.480,0:52:48.249
all the points attached if he gets this

0:52:45.430,0:52:50.140
right oh yes

0:52:48.249,0:52:53.619
Wow seems to be the evening that

0:52:50.140,0:52:56.319
everyone is giving their forward four

0:52:53.619,0:52:57.940
and a half a good show and Ethan Warren

0:52:56.319,0:52:59.650
needed a good one little bit off the

0:52:57.940,0:53:01.299
pace after his first two times

0:52:59.650,0:53:04.299
this is his biggest dive his most

0:53:01.299,0:53:12.029
difficult dive and he certainly slots it

0:53:04.299,0:53:12.029
in beautifully 86 87 88 keep going

0:53:12.180,0:53:17.440
eighty nine point three zero and he was

0:53:14.829,0:53:18.999
19th after round two that will do him a

0:53:17.440,0:53:22.059
great deal of good

0:53:18.999,0:53:23.140
she won't quite a few places well now

0:53:22.059,0:53:26.039
Danny and Seeley

0:53:23.140,0:53:30.789
are France for three and a half quite as

0:53:26.039,0:53:32.950
big yeah opting for the slightly easier

0:53:30.789,0:53:35.200
forward so forward three and a half only

0:53:32.950,0:53:36.880
carries a three point one but it's much

0:53:35.200,0:53:38.950
less riskier than the three point eight

0:53:36.880,0:53:40.299
we saw previously salmon doing a good

0:53:38.950,0:53:42.249
job there lots of people asking on

0:53:40.299,0:53:44.079
Twitter why there's three diving boards

0:53:42.249,0:53:46.299
there well there's a lot of divers

0:53:44.079,0:53:48.640
competing and so when you've got you

0:53:46.299,0:53:50.440
know thirty girls and forty boys or

0:53:48.640,0:53:51.970
training at the same time to have three

0:53:50.440,0:53:54.009
diving boards to choose from actually

0:53:51.970,0:53:55.509
the easiest of congestion all the diving

0:53:54.009,0:53:58.299
boards are three metres they should all

0:53:55.509,0:54:00.160
be made at the same you know ingredients

0:53:58.299,0:54:02.650
so to speak or do reflect spring boards

0:54:00.160,0:54:05.650
so it's just divers preference sixty

0:54:02.650,0:54:08.769
nine point seven five for Damian C D and

0:54:05.650,0:54:10.630
that will maybe help a bit out of his

0:54:08.769,0:54:12.819
current predicament of being twenty

0:54:10.630,0:54:14.289
second now I don't see the Chinese in

0:54:12.819,0:54:16.390
sixth place but that's where her Chong

0:54:14.289,0:54:18.309
the world champion is of course don't

0:54:16.390,0:54:19.599
worry he won't worry because he got two

0:54:18.309,0:54:22.420
more rounds provided he gets through

0:54:19.599,0:54:25.150
this one semi-final and a final to come

0:54:22.420,0:54:26.859
top eighteen to qualify he's in sixth is

0:54:25.150,0:54:30.940
reversed three-and-a-half somersaults

0:54:26.859,0:54:34.529
with tuck well it's a big dive from her

0:54:30.940,0:54:36.880
Cheung Olympic champion four years ago

0:54:34.529,0:54:39.099
and of course he's not bothered really

0:54:36.880,0:54:41.130
you know he's in seventh after the

0:54:39.099,0:54:44.710
second round he knows that he will be

0:54:41.130,0:54:47.319
steadfast and consistent throughout and

0:54:44.710,0:54:49.059
so that is just an example I don't know

0:54:47.319,0:54:50.589
whether it's worth a nine but it will

0:54:49.059,0:54:52.569
get eight eight and a half so it's a big

0:54:50.589,0:54:53.720
dive and that will shoot him up the

0:54:52.569,0:54:58.260
leaderboard

0:54:53.720,0:55:00.569
9 snow not quite to 88.5 for her Chong

0:54:58.260,0:55:03.059
but for the time being he does go into

0:55:00.569,0:55:06.930
first place but the standard has been so

0:55:03.059,0:55:10.079
tough early on may not remain there for

0:55:06.930,0:55:12.390
very long if Gannicus Nets off reverse

0:55:10.079,0:55:18.930
three and a half we're tuck up to a 3.5

0:55:12.390,0:55:21.779
on the degree of difficulty oh now the

0:55:18.930,0:55:24.569
crowd reaction was the same as mine it's

0:55:21.779,0:55:26.069
not a good one that could make it more

0:55:24.569,0:55:27.269
difficult for the Russian here lands on

0:55:26.069,0:55:29.010
the end of the diving board into the

0:55:27.269,0:55:31.470
tuck shape all looks good so far

0:55:29.010,0:55:33.329
reversal in half just kicks up to AI and

0:55:31.470,0:55:37.200
now it's time to get your surfboard side

0:55:33.329,0:55:38.430
Surf's Up what a shame you can do

0:55:37.200,0:55:39.539
something goose grease now I can leave

0:55:38.430,0:55:42.329
Prasad

0:55:39.539,0:55:43.859
yeah this is yeah this is gonna make it

0:55:42.329,0:55:46.380
difficult I think he's got a good buffer

0:55:43.859,0:55:50.220
he's gonna have to dig deep 45 that's

0:55:46.380,0:55:52.200
gonna hurt isn't it big time 45 he's

0:55:50.220,0:55:55.529
gonna go shooting down the rankings he

0:55:52.200,0:55:57.240
was 8,000 I've to he might find himself

0:55:55.529,0:55:58.559
struggling for qualification after this

0:55:57.240,0:56:00.059
round if everybody dives the way they

0:55:58.559,0:56:02.940
have been Daniel

0:56:00.059,0:56:08.190
Aurora of Mexico back two and a half

0:56:02.940,0:56:11.400
with pike 19th place tipping over a

0:56:08.190,0:56:12.990
vertical there as he went in only 3.0 a

0:56:11.400,0:56:14.940
few of the divers opting to use it's

0:56:12.990,0:56:17.130
worth mentioning that the divers have to

0:56:14.940,0:56:19.170
go in different directions six dives and

0:56:17.130,0:56:20.220
five groups have died forward backwards

0:56:19.170,0:56:21.809
which is what you're looking at here

0:56:20.220,0:56:24.059
inwards which is where you stand

0:56:21.809,0:56:26.099
backwards spin forwards reverse is where

0:56:24.059,0:56:27.990
you walk down the diving board jump away

0:56:26.099,0:56:29.819
from it in spin backwards towards it and

0:56:27.990,0:56:32.549
the twist group and then you also get

0:56:29.819,0:56:34.950
another option divers here today doing

0:56:32.549,0:56:36.539
six dives five different groups

0:56:34.950,0:56:38.460
hopefully that explains some of the

0:56:36.539,0:56:40.259
intricacies well this rounds proving to

0:56:38.460,0:56:42.509
be a bit of in thought maybe

0:56:40.259,0:56:47.250
catastrophic for some of the divers a 45

0:56:42.509,0:56:50.460
followed by a 54 now sniffing effect

0:56:47.250,0:56:52.799
he's giving great encouragement after

0:56:50.460,0:56:54.869
that drops dive completely missed dive

0:56:52.799,0:56:56.670
in round two so he's not gonna qualify

0:56:54.869,0:56:59.609
but this is forward two and a half or

0:56:56.670,0:57:02.880
two twists yeah it's really good to see

0:56:59.609,0:57:04.920
he had almost a standing ovation then

0:57:02.880,0:57:07.650
you can see his teammates there knowing

0:57:04.920,0:57:10.520
that it takes a lot of courage to

0:57:07.650,0:57:13.260
it's all over for Stefan his Olympic

0:57:10.520,0:57:15.690
dreams are as good as over because this

0:57:13.260,0:57:17.550
is his only event and unfortunately with

0:57:15.690,0:57:20.010
that failed second round dive that it's

0:57:17.550,0:57:22.140
impossible for him to make it through to

0:57:20.010,0:57:24.510
the semi-final so he's diving it out now

0:57:22.140,0:57:27.060
it's a long wait I'm sure he just wants

0:57:24.510,0:57:28.770
to get it over with but he's showing you

0:57:27.060,0:57:30.960
know his courage and his professionalism

0:57:28.770,0:57:33.060
and he's carrying on six-point-five

0:57:30.960,0:57:34.950
across the board as we get confers

0:57:33.060,0:57:36.810
Bradshaw doesn't hang around for anybody

0:57:34.950,0:57:38.760
least of all me for two and a half two

0:57:36.810,0:57:40.440
twists yep

0:57:38.760,0:57:41.849
you know hang time there for Braccio

0:57:40.440,0:57:44.430
either he's a little bit low on the

0:57:41.849,0:57:46.349
water it's a big dive is three point

0:57:44.430,0:57:48.089
four this is his most complicated or one

0:57:46.349,0:57:49.500
of his most complicated dives he needs

0:57:48.089,0:57:51.570
to be on the end of the diving board

0:57:49.500,0:57:54.930
there to give himself half a chance

0:57:51.570,0:57:58.770
so it's average well obviously good so I

0:57:54.930,0:58:00.510
guess sevens maybe small yeah maybe

0:57:58.770,0:58:03.150
maybe not a little bit scruffy I don't

0:58:00.510,0:58:05.040
know let's see the judges know either

0:58:03.150,0:58:07.500
look at that six up to seven they

0:58:05.040,0:58:09.839
weren't quite sure either sixty six

0:58:07.500,0:58:11.720
point three that's to very low tariffs

0:58:09.839,0:58:14.460
no tariffs or those scoring dives

0:58:11.720,0:58:16.020
together now say czar Castro can you

0:58:14.460,0:58:17.819
change all that with a forward two and a

0:58:16.020,0:58:22.290
half somersaults to twist spike three

0:58:17.819,0:58:24.780
point four he always seems to lose his

0:58:22.290,0:58:26.490
feet as he goes into the water there's a

0:58:24.780,0:58:28.380
busy dive it didn't have a lot of time

0:58:26.490,0:58:30.240
but it's really neat and tidy

0:58:28.380,0:58:32.190
oh he's hanging ten or ten toes over the

0:58:30.240,0:58:33.510
end of the diving board manages to

0:58:32.190,0:58:35.430
complete the tie four let's have a look

0:58:33.510,0:58:37.980
here as he goes in did you see his feet

0:58:35.430,0:58:40.530
split so maybe the judges will penalize

0:58:37.980,0:58:42.480
him well maybe it happened so quickly

0:58:40.530,0:58:44.220
that they didn't see it you wait and see

0:58:42.480,0:58:47.250
did very well there with his toes all

0:58:44.220,0:58:49.230
the way over the end God say the best

0:58:47.250,0:58:50.760
judging has always been in the final

0:58:49.230,0:58:52.230
this week when we're down to the the

0:58:50.760,0:58:55.230
best judges in the fewer countries but

0:58:52.230,0:58:57.240
at 7.5 gives him a seventy six point

0:58:55.230,0:58:58.770
five zero with the multiplication on

0:58:57.240,0:59:01.079
that degree of difficulty back at the

0:58:58.770,0:59:07.290
Olympics for the second time 12 years

0:59:01.079,0:59:10.440
Ken you know nice work from Kenny very

0:59:07.290,0:59:12.690
elegant dive up and yeah he's performing

0:59:10.440,0:59:15.060
consistently well today that's him was

0:59:12.690,0:59:17.550
he in the top 10 he was yes top 10 after

0:59:15.060,0:59:18.630
the first two vines beautiful

0:59:17.550,0:59:20.100
third-round dive

0:59:18.630,0:59:22.940
halfway through his contour

0:59:20.100,0:59:25.800
and he certainly where he wants to be in

0:59:22.940,0:59:28.770
striking distance of the semi-final

0:59:25.800,0:59:32.550
spots well others are faltering but he

0:59:28.770,0:59:35.690
isn't and the good series of dives 71

0:59:32.550,0:59:38.280
followed by an 81 followed by a 72 and

0:59:35.690,0:59:40.020
after absence of 12 years his return to

0:59:38.280,0:59:42.450
the Olympics is being pretty good so far

0:59:40.020,0:59:47.850
patrick housing in 12 for two and a half

0:59:42.450,0:59:49.290
two twists yes very solid watching his

0:59:47.850,0:59:50.810
teammate having a tough day at the

0:59:49.290,0:59:54.480
office it's down to Patrick now to

0:59:50.810,0:59:56.580
represent Germany and get through and he

0:59:54.480,0:59:58.590
is a very very good diver and I would be

0:59:56.580,1:00:00.540
surprised to see him not go through and

0:59:58.590,1:00:04.200
that's three out of three for hosting so

1:00:00.540,1:00:08.880
far that could squeeze over 80 points

1:00:04.200,1:00:11.700
his three point four it's good yeah Joe

1:00:08.880,1:00:13.560
just just inputting into their machines

1:00:11.700,1:00:16.500
coming up on the scoreboard in front of

1:00:13.560,1:00:19.140
us and then in front of the viewers at

1:00:16.500,1:00:23.220
home eighty one point six zero for

1:00:19.140,1:00:24.630
housing 12 in Shanghai the world

1:00:23.220,1:00:27.990
championships last year

1:00:24.630,1:00:32.100
here comes Alexi rigged or off with his

1:00:27.990,1:00:34.920
back two and a half so I saw 3.0 his

1:00:32.100,1:00:36.510
easiest I've only 3.0 opting to play a

1:00:34.920,1:00:40.890
little bit safer than some of his other

1:00:36.510,1:00:43.200
high-risk dives and yep he's plopped it

1:00:40.890,1:00:45.510
on his head he's not going to get more

1:00:43.200,1:00:49.890
than seven and a half so eights but it's

1:00:45.510,1:00:51.510
where he needs to be squeezing into the

1:00:49.890,1:00:53.640
pike shape moving back a little bit from

1:00:51.510,1:00:55.710
the diving board causing a few

1:00:53.640,1:00:57.750
discrepancies with the control into the

1:00:55.710,1:01:00.930
hot tub and they little way for us at

1:00:57.750,1:01:02.310
home sixty 7.50 minor one little bit

1:01:00.930,1:01:04.590
more than that but it's a low degree of

1:01:02.310,1:01:07.260
difficulty so probably worth about that

1:01:04.590,1:01:11.520
Xavier Alana Garcia for three and a half

1:01:07.260,1:01:13.740
somersault spiked three point one that's

1:01:11.520,1:01:15.810
almost there for javi just a little bit

1:01:13.740,1:01:18.540
off his game again entering the water

1:01:15.810,1:01:20.360
short you'll see on the replay you're

1:01:18.540,1:01:23.250
looking for that vertical entry in

1:01:20.360,1:01:25.020
having a not quite hanging on to his

1:01:23.250,1:01:28.410
shape long enough just let's go a little

1:01:25.020,1:01:32.310
bit early a little shorter vertical him

1:01:28.410,1:01:33.980
hope for a bit more get eight and he was

1:01:32.310,1:01:37.010
he 14th after the second

1:01:33.980,1:01:38.480
and yeah so he's certainly gonna get

1:01:37.010,1:01:41.119
through to the semis if he continues to

1:01:38.480,1:01:42.740
stay in that region seventh of the

1:01:41.119,1:01:45.200
moment you know obviously you drop down

1:01:42.740,1:01:47.150
a few more notches yet but the moment

1:01:45.200,1:01:50.780
he's a little bit of daylight between

1:01:47.150,1:01:52.640
himself and the struggle is now Chris

1:01:50.780,1:01:55.580
Cole wall gives us a big smile every

1:01:52.640,1:01:57.590
time before he performs his dives here

1:01:55.580,1:01:59.150
comes his third round attempt on a four

1:01:57.590,1:02:01.970
two and a half somersaults and two

1:01:59.150,1:02:07.700
twists pike worth three point four with

1:02:01.970,1:02:09.980
the degree of difficulty it's good Chris

1:02:07.700,1:02:12.890
is back loaded his list so this is where

1:02:09.980,1:02:14.900
he starts to to bring out his big gun so

1:02:12.890,1:02:18.410
this is a first of his three point force

1:02:14.900,1:02:20.119
in succession so here we are lands on

1:02:18.410,1:02:23.450
the end beautiful heard of steps such

1:02:20.119,1:02:26.720
great rhythm and timing as very precise

1:02:23.450,1:02:29.359
it will be squeezing high 70s maybe even

1:02:26.720,1:02:31.730
80 points out of that dive it's exactly

1:02:29.359,1:02:35.180
where he needs to be yeah anything

1:02:31.730,1:02:37.130
80-plus is always good and it's right on

1:02:35.180,1:02:39.530
the cusp of an eighty seventy nine point

1:02:37.130,1:02:42.260
nine zero for Cole well lifts him up to

1:02:39.530,1:02:45.320
third now this man started like a train

1:02:42.260,1:02:46.640
this is a huge dive and this could be

1:02:45.320,1:02:48.680
the difference between him qualifying

1:02:46.640,1:02:50.840
and not forward four and a half summer

1:02:48.680,1:02:53.390
sorts for Ross eight in the tuck

1:02:50.840,1:02:56.359
position there we go

1:02:53.390,1:02:58.460
he's that could be the comeback King

1:02:56.359,1:03:01.100
he's just got his claws out and he

1:02:58.460,1:03:03.859
started to fall himself back into

1:03:01.100,1:03:06.859
contention a beautiful first round dive

1:03:03.859,1:03:08.660
an absolutely diabolical second round

1:03:06.859,1:03:10.670
dive and then he's nailed his most

1:03:08.660,1:03:12.950
difficult one three point eight the

1:03:10.670,1:03:14.960
forward four and a half somersaults in

1:03:12.950,1:03:17.810
the tuck position Wow

1:03:14.960,1:03:21.230
here we go well that's a good recovery

1:03:17.810,1:03:23.540
very very good recovery from Ross a 7.5

1:03:21.230,1:03:27.710
times that degree of difficulty gives

1:03:23.540,1:03:29.869
him mid 80 fives so a reparation job has

1:03:27.710,1:03:32.210
started one and truly for the Frenchman

1:03:29.869,1:03:37.550
to move on to the young Canadian

1:03:32.210,1:03:39.020
Francois in bought du Lac a third after

1:03:37.550,1:03:41.510
round two needs to make up some ground

1:03:39.020,1:03:44.900
back two and a half somersaults with

1:03:41.510,1:03:47.650
Pike 3.0 degree of difficulty for in

1:03:44.900,1:03:47.650
both Dulac

1:03:53.800,1:03:59.290
yep he's nice and steady today fudge-wad

1:03:56.780,1:04:01.760
he certainly will probably be one of the

1:03:59.290,1:04:04.310
the ones that doesn't quite make the cut

1:04:01.760,1:04:07.220
but if he stays there and other people

1:04:04.310,1:04:08.960
are faltering he could certainly sneak

1:04:07.220,1:04:11.660
up into top 18 I think he was in the

1:04:08.960,1:04:13.670
early 20s after has a rank after that

1:04:11.660,1:04:17.920
second round I'll probably keep him

1:04:13.670,1:04:17.920
about that place after his third vines

1:04:18.910,1:04:24.860
the mark is 63 it's seven so it was a

1:04:22.910,1:04:26.750
low degree of difficulty so our favorite

1:04:24.860,1:04:27.680
mark returns again the way it gone

1:04:26.750,1:04:32.180
missing it

1:04:27.680,1:04:35.900
63 in blue do like Ilya Zakharov first

1:04:32.180,1:04:40.250
after round 2 after round 1 reverse

1:04:35.900,1:04:42.470
three and a half sneaks it in there

1:04:40.250,1:04:44.000
I did actually move towards Bob there

1:04:42.470,1:04:46.040
not because I wanted to get closer to

1:04:44.000,1:04:48.260
pop but because I thought Zach offers a

1:04:46.040,1:04:50.600
little bit close to the diving board

1:04:48.260,1:04:53.480
there actually when he goes by his okay

1:04:50.600,1:04:54.830
let's have a look yeah he's okay he

1:04:53.480,1:04:56.750
didn't want to do a Greg Louganis

1:04:54.830,1:04:58.850
and fortunately Gregory gayness of

1:04:56.750,1:05:01.190
course World and Olympic champion his

1:04:58.850,1:05:03.950
head in dramatic fashion on a reverse

1:05:01.190,1:05:06.080
dive in the 88 games no Greg Louganis

1:05:03.950,1:05:09.710
first Acker off today well that's good

1:05:06.080,1:05:12.860
82 points be in the lead a 2.25 and Greg

1:05:09.710,1:05:15.650
is mentoring a lot of the USA divers

1:05:12.860,1:05:20.720
here now a liqu reverse two and a half

1:05:15.650,1:05:23.360
somersaults with pike for de Partie very

1:05:20.720,1:05:25.460
interesting indeed a party playing it

1:05:23.360,1:05:26.870
safe normally doing the reverse three

1:05:25.460,1:05:29.420
and a half which is what we saw from

1:05:26.870,1:05:32.390
zakharov playing safe here with the 3.0

1:05:29.420,1:05:35.330
so it needed to be very good and it was

1:05:32.390,1:05:37.310
just that beautiful you could just see

1:05:35.330,1:05:39.770
that technique this should get nines and

1:05:37.310,1:05:41.270
it needs to get nines because beautiful

1:05:39.770,1:05:43.490
slow motion look at that looking at

1:05:41.270,1:05:45.200
where he's being spotting moving his

1:05:43.490,1:05:47.600
chin looking at the water leaving his

1:05:45.200,1:05:50.240
toes towards the scoreboard and then he

1:05:47.600,1:05:52.430
goes all in less than 1.8 seconds well

1:05:50.240,1:05:54.860
he knows how to do it does Alex twice a

1:05:52.430,1:05:56.450
so a medalist at the Olympics hasn't

1:05:54.860,1:05:57.860
quite got the demeanor I'd like to see

1:05:56.450,1:05:59.150
from Alex mo he kind of has that

1:05:57.860,1:06:01.310
slightly hangdog

1:05:59.150,1:06:02.900
look hopefully that will return the

1:06:01.310,1:06:04.160
smile will return anyway in the

1:06:02.900,1:06:06.500
semi-finals reverse two and a half

1:06:04.160,1:06:12.610
somersaults one half twist four in the

1:06:06.500,1:06:15.410
okiya vouchers nailing his dives

1:06:12.610,1:06:17.690
slotting them in and that's exactly what

1:06:15.410,1:06:20.450
he needs to do dive after dive that's

1:06:17.690,1:06:22.400
three out of three for kovash up big

1:06:20.450,1:06:23.960
degrees of difficulty as well he's not

1:06:22.400,1:06:26.450
messing around for his fifth round I

1:06:23.960,1:06:29.270
missed his lowest degree of difficulty

1:06:26.450,1:06:34.490
but at the moment he's very much in the

1:06:29.270,1:06:36.710
mix how much in the mix is he well

1:06:34.490,1:06:38.960
seventy nine point two zero puts him for

1:06:36.710,1:06:40.670
the time being at least into third place

1:06:38.960,1:06:42.020
looking fairly comfortable for

1:06:40.670,1:06:44.090
qualification they were not even halfway

1:06:42.020,1:06:44.950
yet remember three more rounds still to

1:06:44.090,1:06:47.810
come

1:06:44.950,1:06:50.000
it's a young Colombian Sebastian V I

1:06:47.810,1:06:53.440
guess turn it up for two and a half

1:06:50.000,1:06:56.480
somersaults to twist three point four

1:06:53.440,1:06:57.980
just a little bit low on the water you

1:06:56.480,1:07:02.180
can certainly see the difference between

1:06:57.980,1:07:04.190
some of the stronger divers here we are

1:07:02.180,1:07:06.290
the young Colombian he does a good job

1:07:04.190,1:07:07.730
here's a double twist after the one half

1:07:06.290,1:07:09.890
some sauce he's the completion of the

1:07:07.730,1:07:11.600
time just running out of room he

1:07:09.890,1:07:14.330
probably won't get more than sixes on

1:07:11.600,1:07:19.690
that one just showing you how difficult

1:07:14.330,1:07:21.340
these dives are 68 for Sebastian via

1:07:19.690,1:07:29.920
Castaneda

1:07:21.340,1:07:32.930
on my front page just in 14th place

1:07:29.920,1:07:34.610
listen to that raw seventeen and a half

1:07:32.930,1:07:37.690
thousand people the majority of which

1:07:34.610,1:07:41.660
are favoring of the Brits Chris me is

1:07:37.690,1:07:43.490
learning the lessons previous divers

1:07:41.660,1:07:44.990
have had taking his time and just

1:07:43.490,1:07:47.570
soaking up the atmosphere before he gets

1:07:44.990,1:07:49.100
his full concentration on a reverse

1:07:47.570,1:07:50.870
two and a half somersaults one and a

1:07:49.100,1:07:51.440
half twist three point three degree of

1:07:50.870,1:07:56.680
difficulty

1:07:51.440,1:07:56.680
yeah it's currently 15th after round two

1:07:56.950,1:08:02.000
little bit short as he goes in but the

1:07:59.630,1:08:04.300
crowd liked it they're ripping the roof

1:08:02.000,1:08:06.710
off here those Christmas Mum and Dad

1:08:04.300,1:08:09.170
avid supporters of their son here we are

1:08:06.710,1:08:10.790
swinging the arms one and a half twist

1:08:09.170,1:08:13.010
into the two and a half summer sauce

1:08:10.790,1:08:15.200
just a little short of vertical that

1:08:13.010,1:08:21.890
means while you're struggle to get more

1:08:15.200,1:08:24.980
than seven switch you ever seen the

1:08:21.890,1:08:27.130
markets who await will not spoil your

1:08:24.980,1:08:27.130
surprise

1:08:27.490,1:08:33.880
mm 6.5 can I boo I'm not allowed to do

1:08:31.420,1:08:35.980
that's fairly unprofessional like a

1:08:33.880,1:08:37.750
normally am really can Quang are

1:08:35.980,1:08:39.580
Malaysia reverse two and half

1:08:37.750,1:08:42.810
somersaults one half twist you can be at

1:08:39.580,1:08:42.810
home if you of course if you want to

1:08:43.200,1:08:50.920
walk following me is with the same dive

1:08:47.730,1:08:53.020
three point three degree of difficulty

1:08:50.920,1:08:54.520
so it's big it's tricky here we are

1:08:53.020,1:08:56.830
here's the one and a half twist moving

1:08:54.520,1:08:58.030
safely away from the diving board little

1:08:56.830,1:09:00.070
bit scruffy is a better effort than

1:08:58.030,1:09:04.270
Chris me is probably gonna get seven

1:09:00.070,1:09:07.140
seven point five steady from the thirty

1:09:04.270,1:09:09.310
year old from Malaysia formerly China

1:09:07.140,1:09:11.200
there are times when Leon gets a little

1:09:09.310,1:09:12.880
bit personal story probably big and

1:09:11.200,1:09:17.920
tricky again but don't mind it does have

1:09:12.880,1:09:21.310
no time to time now to Jack law again

1:09:17.920,1:09:23.680
the crowd responds lots of Union flags

1:09:21.310,1:09:26.410
and that's the Tim meter ball we'll see

1:09:23.680,1:09:29.890
you later on in the week go down seven

1:09:26.410,1:09:36.100
meters you'll find Jackie law of

1:09:29.890,1:09:39.100
qualifications reversed over the end of

1:09:36.100,1:09:41.080
the diving boards hanging ten and that's

1:09:39.100,1:09:43.600
not good especially when you need to

1:09:41.080,1:09:45.730
stay in balance spin backwards look at

1:09:43.600,1:09:48.220
this hanging ten he did well to stay on

1:09:45.730,1:09:50.290
skips off the diving board just showing

1:09:48.220,1:09:53.460
how talented this young boy is he's only

1:09:50.290,1:09:56.050
17 he's really young in the competition

1:09:53.460,1:10:00.370
squeezing into that tuck shape as tight

1:09:56.050,1:10:02.140
as he possibly can waiting jaw oh this

1:10:00.370,1:10:03.640
is gonna be tough for Jack now it is

1:10:02.140,1:10:06.460
gonna be very tough indeed when he get

1:10:03.640,1:10:10.390
marks like that is the idea five point

1:10:06.460,1:10:12.580
five and that is going to be a big dent

1:10:10.390,1:10:16.810
in this helps a qualification not

1:10:12.580,1:10:32.110
completely irreversible but it's gonna

1:10:16.810,1:10:34.380
be tough now oh it's another tidy died

1:10:32.110,1:10:36.790
beautiful entry into the water

1:10:34.380,1:10:38.200
maybe his aerial work isn't quite as

1:10:36.790,1:10:39.490
impressive as strong as some of the

1:10:38.200,1:10:41.140
divers but you can certainly see why

1:10:39.490,1:10:46.840
he's earned his spot here in the Olymp

1:10:41.140,1:10:50.830
liveries superb entry into the water

1:10:46.840,1:10:52.810
splash this 7.5 s i think so

1:10:50.830,1:10:55.450
mice reaction really works in a very

1:10:52.810,1:10:57.670
very poor opening round dive and he has

1:10:55.450,1:11:00.760
since recovered very very well indeed

1:10:57.670,1:11:05.370
7.5 s good total seventy six point five

1:11:00.760,1:11:09.640
zero now to the first of the italians

1:11:05.370,1:11:11.670
here's to my sovereign LD are they back

1:11:09.640,1:11:14.470
two and a half somersaults with mike

1:11:11.670,1:11:16.150
25th after round two but a couple of

1:11:14.470,1:11:18.730
people have faltered just above him

1:11:16.150,1:11:20.770
there's a chance for the first of the

1:11:18.730,1:11:23.250
two Italians will see to move up a few

1:11:20.770,1:11:23.250
spaces

1:11:23.970,1:11:30.580
yes he will yes he will indeed beautiful

1:11:28.600,1:11:32.770
dive three points a vote needed to be

1:11:30.580,1:11:34.900
good it's all about being consistent

1:11:32.770,1:11:36.060
seeing some divers starting to fall

1:11:34.900,1:11:38.590
turnout

1:11:36.060,1:11:38.920
tomaso that one of his better efforts

1:11:38.590,1:11:40.990
today

1:11:38.920,1:11:45.250
will he get 70 points I don't think he'd

1:11:40.990,1:11:47.200
be too far away that heartbeat in the

1:11:45.250,1:11:49.690
backgrounds quite dramatic here in the

1:11:47.200,1:11:50.980
pool well I don't think we need any more

1:11:49.690,1:11:54.280
drama I think we've heard plenty of

1:11:50.980,1:11:57.940
drama thank you very much I think you

1:11:54.280,1:12:01.750
could cope with it Tommaso Rinaldi with

1:11:57.940,1:12:05.230
that mark for him now Ching Kai of China

1:12:01.750,1:12:06.970
seventh after round two here comes a big

1:12:05.230,1:12:11.350
one from him three point five reverse

1:12:06.970,1:12:13.330
three and a half oh so big dive indeed

1:12:11.350,1:12:16.300
three point five it's the one that we

1:12:13.330,1:12:18.970
just saw Jack Lord make a bit of a mess

1:12:16.300,1:12:20.410
of but no mistakes punching Kai here

1:12:18.970,1:12:22.570
landing on the end of the diving board

1:12:20.410,1:12:24.990
up up and away white above the five

1:12:22.570,1:12:27.220
meter and then drops into the water

1:12:24.990,1:12:33.940
making it look easy

1:12:27.220,1:12:38.680
will he get 90 points may be very close

1:12:33.940,1:12:41.020
to just shy of eight point five for King

1:12:38.680,1:12:43.980
Kai but slipped him up to second place

1:12:41.020,1:12:50.290
Acker off though holding firm in first

1:12:43.980,1:12:52.930
try ado may was in fifth place after

1:12:50.290,1:12:54.820
round two so very comfortable in terms

1:12:52.930,1:12:56.619
of looking forward to qualification for

1:12:54.820,1:12:59.139
or the semies back two and a half

1:12:56.619,1:13:02.949
somersaults with pike the man from the

1:12:59.139,1:13:06.460
USA 3.0 degree of difficulty on his

1:13:02.949,1:13:09.730
third round dive yeah this is a dive

1:13:06.460,1:13:10.869
that Troy used to start with maybe a

1:13:09.730,1:13:12.489
little bit shaky for him at the

1:13:10.869,1:13:14.110
beginning seems to have moved it to the

1:13:12.489,1:13:16.150
middle of his program it's his lowest

1:13:14.110,1:13:17.800
degree of difficulty so it needs to be

1:13:16.150,1:13:20.290
good and that's a good effort from to me

1:13:17.800,1:13:22.090
that I've not seen him diving this well

1:13:20.290,1:13:25.570
for many many years in fact he's in the

1:13:22.090,1:13:27.219
form of his life and he's 32 years old

1:13:25.570,1:13:28.869
which of course isn't very old for

1:13:27.219,1:13:31.239
everyone at home but in diving terms

1:13:28.869,1:13:35.199
it's getting on a bit now something me

1:13:31.239,1:13:36.579
feel nature makes me feel positively

1:13:35.199,1:13:39.040
ancient I've got to tell you that much

1:13:36.579,1:13:42.969
thank you very much seventy six point

1:13:39.040,1:13:44.349
five zero for Troy dumain if you don't

1:13:42.969,1:13:48.219
mind granddad will introduce the next

1:13:44.349,1:13:50.139
diver now Castillo quarter three point

1:13:48.219,1:13:51.730
eight yeah we've seen this before seen

1:13:50.139,1:13:53.679
it go right we've seen it go wrong and

1:13:51.730,1:13:59.770
forward four and a half summer sorts

1:13:53.679,1:14:01.540
with tuck for the Mexican and I think

1:13:59.770,1:14:03.909
that's somewhere in between somewhere in

1:14:01.540,1:14:05.460
between right and wrong it's good and it

1:14:03.909,1:14:08.650
certainly will keep you out in

1:14:05.460,1:14:09.940
contention it's high-risk it's good to

1:14:08.650,1:14:12.659
see him using it here in the polymer

1:14:09.940,1:14:15.250
East not hiding using all his big dives

1:14:12.659,1:14:18.159
forward for now look at the strain on

1:14:15.250,1:14:19.599
his face hanging on there four foot well

1:14:18.159,1:14:23.440
for dear life but that's worthwhile

1:14:19.599,1:14:26.500
worth look at the face where you go

1:14:23.440,1:14:29.440
careful I know forward four and a half

1:14:26.500,1:14:32.170
so impressive and it's good it'll get

1:14:29.440,1:14:33.820
more eighty points will it let's see mmm

1:14:32.170,1:14:35.380
thinking about to here restraining order

1:14:33.820,1:14:37.810
on him for some time yeah Castillo

1:14:35.380,1:14:40.420
welter comes up with eighty one point

1:14:37.810,1:14:44.130
seven zero one danger money keeps doing

1:14:40.420,1:14:46.810
that now on to Rodriguez robert pirès

1:14:44.130,1:14:54.690
Rodriguez I've been this way on a pike

1:14:46.810,1:14:57.070
position for his back two and a half Oh

1:14:54.690,1:14:58.960
all right you know it's when you're

1:14:57.070,1:15:01.030
comparing contrasting with the best in

1:14:58.960,1:15:04.239
the world you can see here he's only 18

1:15:01.030,1:15:05.770
Robert Rodriguez and you can see it's a

1:15:04.239,1:15:07.869
little bit here in there little bit

1:15:05.770,1:15:08.680
scruffy it turns in it doesn't quite

1:15:07.869,1:15:10.480
turn into it but

1:15:08.680,1:15:13.090
does an impression of a banana on the

1:15:10.480,1:15:14.590
end there loses his legs a little bit of

1:15:13.090,1:15:16.480
course the judges don't see the replay

1:15:14.590,1:15:19.980
but they did pick up on those

1:15:16.480,1:15:23.050
discrepancies forty-nine point five zero

1:15:19.980,1:15:25.600
not a great mark my great succession of

1:15:23.050,1:15:30.400
scores and he will be struggling to

1:15:25.600,1:15:31.210
return in the semi-finals - Michaela

1:15:30.400,1:15:33.520
benedetti

1:15:31.210,1:15:35.170
take it a little bit more time more

1:15:33.520,1:15:38.320
considered over this dive because the

1:15:35.170,1:15:39.910
last one he rushed into very quickly

1:15:38.320,1:15:41.530
back two and a half somersaults this

1:15:39.910,1:15:45.090
time for his third round I have 16th

1:15:41.530,1:15:48.970
after round 2 this one in the position

1:15:45.090,1:15:51.340
nice really nice third round dive there

1:15:48.970,1:15:52.120
completing this third third round from

1:15:51.340,1:15:58.060
Italy

1:15:52.120,1:16:00.190
Michaela Benedetti 3.0 so it needed to

1:15:58.060,1:16:03.010
be good and that's very good bag full of

1:16:00.190,1:16:04.630
eights and he'll certainly shift himself

1:16:03.010,1:16:06.850
up the rankings a little bit with that

1:16:04.630,1:16:09.580
one especially with quite a few divers

1:16:06.850,1:16:12.340
faltering on round three halfway yep

1:16:09.580,1:16:16.990
half way three done three more to go and

1:16:12.340,1:16:19.710
then dirty picks up 72 3/8 x the degree

1:16:16.990,1:16:19.710
of difficulty

1:16:25.579,1:16:32.480
so now we change the judges and we look

1:16:29.000,1:16:35.719
at the score and half wait Nidia

1:16:32.480,1:16:38.270
zakharov impeccable so far in first

1:16:35.719,1:16:42.409
place Chinese two and four Webster's

1:16:38.270,1:16:44.150
having a good time as I say one of the

1:16:42.409,1:16:46.699
Americans is doing worse both Americans

1:16:44.150,1:16:48.920
on that front page anyone German now in

1:16:46.699,1:16:50.510
contention now what's happening on page

1:16:48.920,1:16:54.380
two I examine the day party has moved

1:16:50.510,1:16:56.510
into a position to qualify as has nearly

1:16:54.380,1:17:00.260
the Greek their 19th place good recovery

1:16:56.510,1:17:02.510
by Papa RunAs do you don't see the

1:17:00.260,1:17:06.679
British flag on there do you because

1:17:02.510,1:17:08.570
Christmas is 21st check law its 26th

1:17:06.679,1:17:11.300
Chris not that far away

1:17:08.570,1:17:13.369
Jack quite some way away you'll have to

1:17:11.300,1:17:15.650
really pick up his game last three dives

1:17:13.369,1:17:18.110
to have any chance of qualification

1:17:15.650,1:17:21.980
sniffing tech savvy well and truly out

1:17:18.110,1:17:24.739
of it after dropping around two new

1:17:21.980,1:17:26.540
judges in place what was clap themselves

1:17:24.739,1:17:28.340
will be the judge of that thank you very

1:17:26.540,1:17:30.980
much at the end of your three rounds I

1:17:28.340,1:17:33.050
think it's important that the the judges

1:17:30.980,1:17:35.420
are changed it's a long long competition

1:17:33.050,1:17:37.400
and everyone gets tired including you

1:17:35.420,1:17:38.690
and I Bob so we need to hold our

1:17:37.400,1:17:40.790
concentration but when you're judging

1:17:38.690,1:17:43.040
dive after dive after dive after dive

1:17:40.790,1:17:45.800
after dive after dive you get a bit

1:17:43.040,1:17:47.570
tired so mix out the judges fresh panel

1:17:45.800,1:17:50.630
the dive is obviously remain the same

1:17:47.570,1:17:52.280
halfway yes there to go break Duluth wow

1:17:50.630,1:17:53.989
they get a break in between the judges

1:17:52.280,1:17:56.780
have to judge every dive the divers have

1:17:53.989,1:17:58.760
to do one dive every round that's a

1:17:56.780,1:17:59.989
great shot that's a really great shot

1:17:58.760,1:18:02.059
from the same region bawdy we're seeing

1:17:59.989,1:18:03.889
that a lot more towards the end of the

1:18:02.059,1:18:05.929
week when we have the women's ten meter

1:18:03.889,1:18:08.449
and the men's which people keep asking

1:18:05.929,1:18:10.849
me where is it it's on Friday the

1:18:08.449,1:18:11.719
preliminaries and the semi-finals on

1:18:10.849,1:18:14.059
Saturday morning

1:18:11.719,1:18:16.070
that's UK time of course wherever you're

1:18:14.059,1:18:18.440
watching in the world and the final is

1:18:16.070,1:18:22.460
at seven o'clock British Summer Time on

1:18:18.440,1:18:24.920
Saturday evening now Ethan Warren first

1:18:22.460,1:18:27.650
diver in round four in the comfort zone

1:18:24.920,1:18:29.510
at the moment in 10th in with three and

1:18:27.650,1:18:33.770
a half summer sorts with tuck three

1:18:29.510,1:18:37.140
point four kind of a middling dive with

1:18:33.770,1:18:40.050
still plenty of danger attached to it

1:18:37.140,1:18:42.550
this is definitely not a middling dive

1:18:40.050,1:18:44.200
3.4 degree of difficulty this is as

1:18:42.550,1:18:47.110
tough as it comes on the inward move

1:18:44.200,1:18:49.750
gotta stay right over the diving board

1:18:47.110,1:18:51.550
squeezing into the Tuck shape gotta stay

1:18:49.750,1:18:53.230
close enough to make it but jump far

1:18:51.550,1:18:55.300
enough away to miss it you can see him

1:18:53.230,1:18:56.800
almost landing on his chamois there

1:18:55.300,1:18:58.390
which is what the divers used to drive

1:18:56.800,1:19:00.790
themselves off obviously using that as a

1:18:58.390,1:19:02.500
little bit of a spotting technique he's

1:19:00.790,1:19:03.970
on his head again it's okay and it's a

1:19:02.500,1:19:07.210
big score because of the degree of

1:19:03.970,1:19:10.840
difficulty semi 6.50 thumbs up at the

1:19:07.210,1:19:12.670
smile from Ethan the time being he moves

1:19:10.840,1:19:16.120
into first now we've seen a bit of

1:19:12.670,1:19:18.280
accurate sake performance by Damien

1:19:16.120,1:19:19.720
Seeley so far as he was reversed three

1:19:18.280,1:19:22.710
and a half some sorts with tuck is like

1:19:19.720,1:19:25.570
it's worth three point five on the DD

1:19:22.710,1:19:27.520
he's done okay with it he did kind of

1:19:25.570,1:19:29.290
turn his body towards us as he came into

1:19:27.520,1:19:32.320
the end of the diving board I'm not

1:19:29.290,1:19:35.470
quite sure why he did that or how come

1:19:32.320,1:19:37.810
as you can see just facing slightly skew

1:19:35.470,1:19:39.760
if but not to skew if for the judges to

1:19:37.810,1:19:41.680
penalize he's moving sideways a lot

1:19:39.760,1:19:44.110
actually let's see if we get an overhead

1:19:41.680,1:19:46.480
shot you have to take it for me he was

1:19:44.110,1:19:48.640
moving sideways which will impact the

1:19:46.480,1:19:51.900
entry into the water just drifting as he

1:19:48.640,1:19:54.820
goes in we call that cast in diving and

1:19:51.900,1:19:56.600
we are cast in fishing as well don't

1:19:54.820,1:19:58.260
they

1:19:56.600,1:19:59.520
sounds like I know what I'm talking

1:19:58.260,1:20:01.800
about got a clue when I'm talking about

1:19:59.520,1:20:07.200
quite frankly being it would be the

1:20:01.800,1:20:08.610
first time her Chong of China in with

1:20:07.200,1:20:11.280
three and a half somersaults with tuck

1:20:08.610,1:20:12.690
three point four damn I like about the

1:20:11.280,1:20:14.790
Chinese I'm like some of the other diets

1:20:12.690,1:20:16.860
we've seen today they are studied and

1:20:14.790,1:20:19.680
very methodical the way they do things

1:20:16.860,1:20:23.250
they don't rush into a tie they take all

1:20:19.680,1:20:31.650
the time it's allowed to them its forth

1:20:23.250,1:20:33.900
after round three well that is still

1:20:31.650,1:20:37.740
very very good but I'm a little

1:20:33.900,1:20:41.670
surprised it was splashy on the entry as

1:20:37.740,1:20:43.860
we saw there from her tongue normally

1:20:41.670,1:20:46.530
drilling his entries with such precision

1:20:43.860,1:20:48.150
and this one he's attempting to empty

1:20:46.530,1:20:49.500
the pool maybe empty in the pools a

1:20:48.150,1:20:51.870
little bit harsh but he's throwing up

1:20:49.500,1:20:53.310
much more splash than we're used to so

1:20:51.870,1:20:54.930
he might struggle to get eights on that

1:20:53.310,1:20:58.050
he did all the hard work and then just

1:20:54.930,1:21:00.870
letting the dive go over just not happy

1:20:58.050,1:21:01.560
not happy without not happy her what do

1:21:00.870,1:21:06.210
we think

1:21:01.560,1:21:07.830
eight and 7.5 about right definitely

1:21:06.210,1:21:10.290
okay well one of the eights will count

1:21:07.830,1:21:12.270
as we move on to Afghani Kuznets off

1:21:10.290,1:21:16.230
forward two and a half seven sorts to

1:21:12.270,1:21:18.960
twist three point four he's got to get

1:21:16.230,1:21:20.580
his dig his heels in and take its toes

1:21:18.960,1:21:22.800
and actually and start getting back up

1:21:20.580,1:21:25.910
this field twenty-second not as he xx

1:21:22.800,1:21:28.530
after yeah xx after the third round dive

1:21:25.910,1:21:30.630
third round I've let him down this one

1:21:28.530,1:21:32.220
will help they will probably get sevens

1:21:30.630,1:21:34.260
but I would have imagined it way

1:21:32.220,1:21:36.600
definitely needs more than seven Stu to

1:21:34.260,1:21:39.270
make his comeback could we see an upset

1:21:36.600,1:21:41.700
happening team GP with some work to do

1:21:39.270,1:21:45.360
and Russian number two with some work to

1:21:41.700,1:21:46.710
do still xx after round three that would

1:21:45.360,1:21:50.640
not improve his situation let's

1:21:46.710,1:21:53.960
everybody else screwed up on their dive

1:21:50.640,1:21:58.290
and see what we can get from the Mexican

1:21:53.960,1:21:59.460
who's next up and you know rope verse

1:21:58.290,1:22:00.489
three and a half so I'm supposed to be

1:21:59.460,1:22:02.170
tucked

1:22:00.489,1:22:04.239
well it's the biggest die from the young

1:22:02.170,1:22:06.730
Mexican a shame really

1:22:04.239,1:22:09.370
he managed to get the aerial work all in

1:22:06.730,1:22:11.200
the right place all he needed to do was

1:22:09.370,1:22:12.910
push his feet up a little bit higher up

1:22:11.200,1:22:14.980
as he entered the water let's have a

1:22:12.910,1:22:17.200
look he just lets go a little bit early

1:22:14.980,1:22:21.040
turned into a bit of a banana back and

1:22:17.200,1:22:22.360
goes into the water 6 is a shame really

1:22:21.040,1:22:25.360
because he did all the hard work and

1:22:22.360,1:22:28.450
they just miss miss ya miscalculated his

1:22:25.360,1:22:30.070
exit from the dive and gets for his

1:22:28.450,1:22:33.910
pains it might have been quite painful

1:22:30.070,1:22:36.370
about 160 8.25 that's not gonna help him

1:22:33.910,1:22:40.930
it was 27th before damn he's gonna move

1:22:36.370,1:22:45.010
up a great deal after that well let's

1:22:40.930,1:22:48.060
see how the crowd reacts to the next man

1:22:45.010,1:22:51.880
on the board Contreras Bradshaw of

1:22:48.060,1:22:54.880
Venezuela because he's in that kind of

1:22:51.880,1:22:56.830
territory with Chris Meers and Jaco in

1:22:54.880,1:22:58.540
particular moment back two and half

1:22:56.830,1:23:01.390
summer sorts with Mike for the

1:22:58.540,1:23:03.340
Venezuelan well if you if you're

1:23:01.390,1:23:05.410
expecting Stephane fake he's obviously

1:23:03.340,1:23:07.660
pulled out of the competition because

1:23:05.410,1:23:09.310
we've just skipped a dive up confused me

1:23:07.660,1:23:11.710
for a few seconds but now he moved on to

1:23:09.310,1:23:13.900
the Venezuelan so Stephan fact who

1:23:11.710,1:23:15.340
failed the dive obviously suffered a bit

1:23:13.900,1:23:17.440
of an injury when he slipped off the

1:23:15.340,1:23:18.790
diving board in dramatic fashion and

1:23:17.440,1:23:20.100
he's at the Venezuela and they're back

1:23:18.790,1:23:23.020
two and a half in the pike position

1:23:20.100,1:23:24.850
pretty middle-of-the-road sevens but

1:23:23.020,1:23:28.350
he's still you know performing

1:23:24.850,1:23:28.350
consistently 2021

1:23:30.130,1:23:35.170
marks are as follows all the lines

1:23:33.159,1:23:41.409
through those marks do not count so the

1:23:35.170,1:23:43.510
sevens all do and we have 63 just to

1:23:41.409,1:23:45.730
confirm for you to confuse me for a bit

1:23:43.510,1:23:47.949
as well seventh is no longer in this

1:23:45.730,1:23:50.020
competition he's gone but says our

1:23:47.949,1:23:51.880
Castro very much in it with his back two

1:23:50.020,1:23:53.550
and a half somersaults 12 after round

1:23:51.880,1:23:56.560
three

1:23:53.550,1:23:58.780
yep it's okay from stays up this is

1:23:56.560,1:24:01.510
lowest degree of difficulty so it needed

1:23:58.780,1:24:03.909
to be good 3.0 it's got a couple of Lodi

1:24:01.510,1:24:05.800
DS in there as we call them and this is

1:24:03.909,1:24:09.370
one of them a couple more to follow

1:24:05.800,1:24:10.780
actually finishing his list with his all

1:24:09.370,1:24:12.190
of his dives a little bit basic which

1:24:10.780,1:24:14.050
always makes it difficult for him to get

1:24:12.190,1:24:16.840
in unless of course he's diving

1:24:14.050,1:24:18.790
consistently which he is I expect him to

1:24:16.840,1:24:21.130
continue to do that and to sneak through

1:24:18.790,1:24:22.750
into the semi-final yeah more than

1:24:21.130,1:24:27.030
sinking at the moment but as plenty of

1:24:22.750,1:24:27.030
divers still to go third place for him

1:24:28.860,1:24:36.969
good know he continues to have a good

1:24:34.630,1:24:39.250
day and this is what it's all about dive

1:24:36.969,1:24:42.280
after dive consistency you can see lots

1:24:39.250,1:24:45.340
of divers faltering and the divers who

1:24:42.280,1:24:49.090
are the ones who continue to focus on

1:24:45.340,1:24:51.489
the job continue to land upright on

1:24:49.090,1:24:54.670
their heads just like Kenny's doing

1:24:51.489,1:24:56.710
there for us high 70s for that diver

1:24:54.670,1:24:59.139
would imagine three point three degree

1:24:56.710,1:25:01.929
of difficulty good work Kenny well I

1:24:59.139,1:25:04.420
gotta say 71 followed by an 81 followed

1:25:01.929,1:25:05.139
by a 72 full of - seventy nine point two

1:25:04.420,1:25:07.780
zero

1:25:05.139,1:25:09.639
we've had some consistent performers in

1:25:07.780,1:25:13.020
the competition so fine he's certainly

1:25:09.639,1:25:15.580
up there amongst them Patrick how's ding

1:25:13.020,1:25:16.900
comfortable top 10 at the moment in with

1:25:15.580,1:25:18.850
three and a half summer sorts with tuck

1:25:16.900,1:25:21.909
three point four four the only German

1:25:18.850,1:25:26.139
now remaining in the competition

1:25:21.909,1:25:29.679
you are precise steady unfaltering and

1:25:26.139,1:25:32.409
unwavering big Thai fervor for Patrick

1:25:29.679,1:25:34.419
three point four it's quite tall for a

1:25:32.409,1:25:37.419
diver so he needs to get his technique

1:25:34.419,1:25:40.590
spot-on and he does just that moving a

1:25:37.419,1:25:43.329
safe safe distance from the diving board

1:25:40.590,1:25:45.489
maybe a little bit too far away actually

1:25:43.329,1:25:47.409
struggled a little bit with his entry

1:25:45.489,1:25:49.959
into the water if he gets a bit nearer

1:25:47.409,1:25:52.030
and a bit higher could get nines seven

1:25:49.959,1:25:54.249
and a half so for that one seventy eight

1:25:52.030,1:25:58.329
point two zero the total Marco's over

1:25:54.249,1:26:00.309
the 300 points for Patrick housing likes

1:25:58.329,1:26:02.320
a bragger off starting with the very

1:26:00.309,1:26:03.909
high diver there's a high tower of 23.5

1:26:02.320,1:26:08.409
on the reverse three and a half summer

1:26:03.909,1:26:11.199
sorts almost crashing out at the

1:26:08.409,1:26:12.130
semi-finals there he did a great job

1:26:11.199,1:26:14.110
there in the end

1:26:12.130,1:26:16.539
let's have a look at this take off yet

1:26:14.110,1:26:17.829
just skips forward then you see that

1:26:16.539,1:26:20.499
skipping off at the knees and the hips

1:26:17.829,1:26:23.079
and hangs on for dear life and just a

1:26:20.499,1:26:24.760
bikes and nice and that is sneaky that

1:26:23.079,1:26:27.820
must have hurt yeah that'll definitely

1:26:24.760,1:26:29.919
job is back but as as divers we're used

1:26:27.820,1:26:32.079
to being beaten up by the gym in the

1:26:29.919,1:26:33.969
water and occasionally that's the way

1:26:32.079,1:26:37.119
you just is body Williams going in there

1:26:33.969,1:26:38.739
you know snapping you're spying the way

1:26:37.119,1:26:42.369
you just need to be tough for a newer

1:26:38.739,1:26:46.840
diver reverse right now have some

1:26:42.369,1:26:48.610
thoughts for Garcia of Spain better

1:26:46.840,1:26:50.919
effort there from javi needed a big one

1:26:48.610,1:26:52.360
and a good one to get it in and that's

1:26:50.919,1:26:54.610
certainly what he's done with his force

1:26:52.360,1:26:58.539
fourth mind a reverse three and a half

1:26:54.610,1:27:01.749
it's a big dive squeezing in beautiful

1:26:58.539,1:27:04.530
elevation pops his feet up and slips

1:27:01.749,1:27:11.250
into the water the night much of a trace

1:27:04.530,1:27:14.070
78 points yeah I think they're happy

1:27:11.250,1:27:15.810
I work out with a Canadian coach what

1:27:14.070,1:27:21.600
was he clapping that would be Spanish I

1:27:15.810,1:27:23.300
didn't notice which I did so my impale

1:27:21.600,1:27:25.860
in the week you're lucky

1:27:23.300,1:27:27.120
Chris go well reverse one-and-a-half

1:27:25.860,1:27:28.380
seven sawed three and half twist it's

1:27:27.120,1:27:30.480
the first time we've seen this dive

1:27:28.380,1:27:32.970
three point four is a degree of

1:27:30.480,1:27:34.920
difficulty in the free position again we

1:27:32.970,1:27:38.610
have seen a free dive can you explain

1:27:34.920,1:27:41.040
that after we've seen it it's very much

1:27:38.610,1:27:42.870
a classic dive for any multiple twisting

1:27:41.040,1:27:44.010
dive less than one and a half

1:27:42.870,1:27:46.470
somersaults or one and a half

1:27:44.010,1:27:48.150
somersaults all or less it is in the

1:27:46.470,1:27:50.700
free position because you don't hold a

1:27:48.150,1:27:52.980
position a pike or tuck for longer than

1:27:50.700,1:27:55.890
half a rotation so it just squares it up

1:27:52.980,1:27:57.540
nicely in the end 3.4 degree of

1:27:55.890,1:27:59.250
difficulty you don't see I think it

1:27:57.540,1:28:01.830
might be the only competitor choosing to

1:27:59.250,1:28:04.170
use this one and a game of tactics

1:28:01.830,1:28:07.860
working for Cole will their three point

1:28:04.170,1:28:09.990
four it's a good dive yeah what the

1:28:07.860,1:28:14.100
judges think new set of judges of course

1:28:09.990,1:28:21.720
they've gone with the 881 point a second

1:28:14.100,1:28:24.870
Macy Ross a is gone here he goes he made

1:28:21.720,1:28:27.120
a real hodgepodge of his second round

1:28:24.870,1:28:28.950
dive and now he's come out all guns

1:28:27.120,1:28:31.710
blazing this is the comeback King he's

1:28:28.950,1:28:35.220
gonna absolutely sail above 85 points

1:28:31.710,1:28:37.800
buries his entry there slipping into the

1:28:35.220,1:28:40.740
water he's hardly throwing up any splash

1:28:37.800,1:28:43.380
Wow this is the way to get yourself back

1:28:40.740,1:28:45.030
in contention I'm gonna have to hold up

1:28:43.380,1:28:47.580
a card say I'm not ready ask him to do

1:28:45.030,1:28:49.620
it again do it again

1:28:47.580,1:28:51.210
that was brilliant eighty seven point

1:28:49.620,1:28:53.940
five zero it was brilliant

1:28:51.210,1:28:57.900
Andros a has really recovered so well

1:28:53.940,1:28:59.760
Francois in BO du Lac his biggest dive

1:28:57.900,1:29:01.260
so far three point five degree of

1:28:59.760,1:29:04.410
difficulty reversed three and a half

1:29:01.260,1:29:09.810
somersaults with tuck yes some work to

1:29:04.410,1:29:10.710
do to the top 18 25th at the moment he's

1:29:09.810,1:29:13.320
done well with it

1:29:10.710,1:29:15.720
notice there he's three dive routine he

1:29:13.320,1:29:18.060
tends to stop there take a big breath

1:29:15.720,1:29:20.460
close his eyes potentially visualized

1:29:18.060,1:29:23.250
the dive and then he sets off very

1:29:20.460,1:29:24.990
composed he is a little bit tight to the

1:29:23.250,1:29:27.540
diving board here I might add

1:29:24.990,1:29:29.430
he's okay he turns into a bit of a fog

1:29:27.540,1:29:30.990
kick as he comes out the breaststrokers

1:29:29.430,1:29:33.360
would have been pleased with that one

1:29:30.990,1:29:36.240
anyway that's a good diamond it's his

1:29:33.360,1:29:37.650
highest degree of difficulty hanging on

1:29:36.240,1:29:41.840
to the top of his kneecaps oh look at

1:29:37.650,1:29:41.840
those Fox legs as he comes out rabbit

1:29:43.310,1:29:50.670
that's very unkind we start talking

1:29:46.830,1:29:52.410
about your personage in the moment now

1:29:50.670,1:29:54.150
Don - Ilya Zakharov

1:29:52.410,1:29:55.860
this man has been the model of

1:29:54.150,1:30:00.090
consistency stand by the commentators

1:29:55.860,1:30:03.150
curse no he is consistent even with a

1:30:00.090,1:30:06.630
dodgy takeoff no smiles from the Russian

1:30:03.150,1:30:08.340
coaches they're here to do business way

1:30:06.630,1:30:10.440
back from the end of the diving board

1:30:08.340,1:30:16.770
and I did think that he'd struggle with

1:30:10.440,1:30:18.540
that but he is superb that can be even

1:30:16.770,1:30:20.070
better he needs a better hurdle step on

1:30:18.540,1:30:22.790
his next dive because he adds in it

1:30:20.070,1:30:25.350
another twist to that dive which goes up

1:30:22.790,1:30:27.150
23.92 grave difficult anyway were tee

1:30:25.350,1:30:33.080
that out that's 81 I believe the

1:30:27.150,1:30:37.130
succession of scores 86 84 8281

1:30:33.080,1:30:37.130
just don't get measured up for that

1:30:38.540,1:30:44.430
Alexandre de Partie inward three and a

1:30:42.120,1:30:46.470
half somersaults we're tuck the top

1:30:44.430,1:30:51.030
Canadian three point four degree of

1:30:46.470,1:30:53.010
difficulty oh it's a good dive little

1:30:51.030,1:30:55.620
short vertical but this is the dive that

1:30:53.010,1:30:58.710
Alex hit his head on this is the dive

1:30:55.620,1:31:01.230
that six weeks ago he smacks his head

1:30:58.710,1:31:02.550
into the springboards it would have been

1:31:01.230,1:31:04.110
about this point that he would have

1:31:02.550,1:31:07.440
connected with the diving board and

1:31:04.110,1:31:11.250
scalped himself 21 stitches on his

1:31:07.440,1:31:14.130
forehead and he's here today six weeks

1:31:11.250,1:31:17.490
later showing true courage in true class

1:31:14.130,1:31:21.660
and he's still in the hunt to make it

1:31:17.490,1:31:23.400
through not enjoying it today but he's

1:31:21.660,1:31:25.980
not enjoying it look his face tells you

1:31:23.400,1:31:28.620
that when he's on top of his game it's

1:31:25.980,1:31:30.600
all smiles and waves but today it's just

1:31:28.620,1:31:32.550
get the job done in here kabocha

1:31:30.600,1:31:35.369
reversed three and a half somersaults

1:31:32.550,1:31:37.889
with tuck 3.5

1:31:35.369,1:31:41.880
or the Ukrainians rocking and rolling

1:31:37.889,1:31:44.940
alongside the Russians they got some big

1:31:41.880,1:31:48.869
big dives all of them have they are

1:31:44.940,1:31:51.389
busting it out today and yep nowhere to

1:31:48.869,1:31:51.780
hide and everyone needs to keep up with

1:31:51.389,1:31:53.760
them

1:31:51.780,1:31:56.040
Wow I wonder if they can hold this

1:31:53.760,1:31:57.449
consistency throughout the prelims and

1:31:56.040,1:31:59.460
the semis and into the final of course

1:31:57.449,1:32:01.619
the scores do not carry so whatever the

1:31:59.460,1:32:03.719
divers do today it's about shuffling the

1:32:01.619,1:32:04.710
pack and earning a berth into the

1:32:03.719,1:32:07.409
semi-finals

1:32:04.710,1:32:10.230
Russia won Ukraine 3 at the moment in

1:32:07.409,1:32:14.730
terms of the pecking order with China in

1:32:10.230,1:32:19.170
second with her charm via Castaneda

1:32:14.730,1:32:23.580
of Colombia a big tariff 93.5 the back

1:32:19.170,1:32:25.590
three and a half it's a big time really

1:32:23.580,1:32:27.239
big time standing back was it's 3.5

1:32:25.590,1:32:28.560
because you don't get the hurdle step to

1:32:27.239,1:32:30.690
assist you as you do on the reverse

1:32:28.560,1:32:33.929
three in half this is a standing start

1:32:30.690,1:32:36.090
if you will Wow he does very well there

1:32:33.929,1:32:38.369
squeezes in runs that lid runs out a

1:32:36.090,1:32:40.020
room a little bit well I'm very

1:32:38.369,1:32:44.400
impressed that's good he's got some big

1:32:40.020,1:32:47.239
decrease of difficulty coming up now

1:32:44.400,1:32:49.909
what the judges have to say about that

1:32:47.239,1:32:54.060
coach I say give him a cuddle already

1:32:49.909,1:32:56.010
sixty eight point two five is his total

1:32:54.060,1:32:58.980
marks well you might have guessed the

1:32:56.010,1:33:02.449
first of the two Brits yes Chris Meers

1:32:58.980,1:33:05.580
standing on the 3-meter springboard

1:33:02.449,1:33:07.199
waiting to perform here's a forward two

1:33:05.580,1:33:08.580
and a half somersaults were to twist and

1:33:07.199,1:33:14.960
we could most consistent of the two

1:33:08.580,1:33:14.960
Britain's today 21st

1:33:15.309,1:33:21.050
as decisive dive and he's nailed it when

1:33:18.110,1:33:23.239
he can't when he needed to yep

1:33:21.050,1:33:26.320
Tom likes it and I agree with Tom Daly

1:33:23.239,1:33:29.149
so I could die for mirs fourth round

1:33:26.320,1:33:31.539
needed to be good attacks it out into

1:33:29.149,1:33:34.699
the double twist down into the pike

1:33:31.539,1:33:37.669
ripping that entry that's it back in

1:33:34.699,1:33:41.019
contention maybe even fact in that

1:33:37.669,1:33:43.119
all-important top eighteen

1:33:41.019,1:33:45.199
super-slow-motion

1:33:43.119,1:33:48.320
can't even keep up with it in slow

1:33:45.199,1:33:51.110
motion can we know it's great really

1:33:48.320,1:33:54.079
great well done Chris good stuff eight

1:33:51.110,1:33:55.789
across the board eighty one point six

1:33:54.079,1:33:58.039
zero has given himself a really good

1:33:55.789,1:34:01.129
chance now with that it's two more round

1:33:58.039,1:34:03.289
still to go let's look at the former

1:34:01.129,1:34:04.789
Chinese now Malaysian going for a

1:34:03.289,1:34:08.719
reverse three and a half somersaults

1:34:04.789,1:34:11.389
with tuck he's ten years and years and

1:34:08.719,1:34:14.989
years of training he does look a little

1:34:11.389,1:34:16.239
bit look as sharp as he used to in his

1:34:14.989,1:34:18.590
here in his younger days

1:34:16.239,1:34:21.050
here we are reversed three and a half

1:34:18.590,1:34:22.429
thirty years old squeezing into that

1:34:21.050,1:34:24.289
touch shake popping his feet up just

1:34:22.429,1:34:26.360
needed to be a little bit higher for

1:34:24.289,1:34:28.489
that a rip entry into the water

1:34:26.360,1:34:30.860
it'll get over seventy five points so

1:34:28.489,1:34:35.510
and it'll certainly keep him in the mix

1:34:30.860,1:34:37.840
for a semifinal spot easily actually 77

1:34:35.510,1:34:42.430
for

1:34:37.840,1:34:45.580
thank one now jackal or you know as you

1:34:42.430,1:34:47.890
look around and take up the plaudits of

1:34:45.580,1:34:52.030
the crowd you have some work to do here

1:34:47.890,1:34:54.250
laddie 17 years of age of star in

1:34:52.030,1:34:55.840
Harrogate European junior champion just

1:34:54.250,1:35:02.410
a few years ago for three and a half

1:34:55.840,1:35:04.540
somersault this needs to be good yes may

1:35:02.410,1:35:06.400
be feeling the pressure it needs to be

1:35:04.540,1:35:08.470
better than that come on Jack your

1:35:06.400,1:35:10.690
double world junior champion double

1:35:08.470,1:35:12.580
junior European champion you've been in

1:35:10.690,1:35:14.770
these senior competitions now you are

1:35:12.580,1:35:15.430
the youngest competitor and there's more

1:35:14.770,1:35:17.560
to come

1:35:15.430,1:35:19.780
more to come from this young man he's

1:35:17.560,1:35:21.730
not going to move up the field with this

1:35:19.780,1:35:23.710
this is going to keep him outside the

1:35:21.730,1:35:26.230
top 18 that's gonna put a lot of

1:35:23.710,1:35:28.510
pressure on his two dives to come but

1:35:26.230,1:35:30.100
I'm confident that he can respond do you

1:35:28.510,1:35:32.320
know what I think I look on the face of

1:35:30.100,1:35:34.360
Jack tell she really all you need to

1:35:32.320,1:35:36.520
know at this stage I think he thinks I

1:35:34.360,1:35:37.900
was starting to think that perhaps he's

1:35:36.520,1:35:40.360
not gonna be returning tomorrow I hope

1:35:37.900,1:35:44.410
that's not the case now he will be so

1:35:40.360,1:35:47.080
far lost Papa RunAs 19th place it's a

1:35:44.410,1:35:49.660
really really poor start he's done a

1:35:47.080,1:35:52.000
good reparation job not quite completely

1:35:49.660,1:35:54.430
o yet in with three and a half

1:35:52.000,1:35:57.120
somersaults with tuck three point four

1:35:54.430,1:35:58.810
degree of difficulty he's in 19th place

1:35:57.120,1:36:03.430
after round three

1:35:58.810,1:36:06.250
oh here you go up the degree of

1:36:03.430,1:36:07.720
difficulty increase the risk and

1:36:06.250,1:36:10.690
obviously increase the probability of

1:36:07.720,1:36:13.810
error and that's what we see here from

1:36:10.690,1:36:15.610
the young diver of Greece squeezes into

1:36:13.810,1:36:19.690
the top just stays in it too long and

1:36:15.610,1:36:24.090
lands in a forward roll position yeah

1:36:19.690,1:36:25.870
over he goes and died and the marks go

1:36:24.090,1:36:27.850
mm well shame

1:36:25.870,1:36:30.670
well shame because he was doing so well

1:36:27.850,1:36:33.010
but not gonna miss two fallacies day I'm

1:36:30.670,1:36:35.380
afraid any of those marks that's gonna

1:36:33.010,1:36:38.800
take him pretty much out of contention

1:36:35.380,1:36:42.370
for a top place where's Tomas old

1:36:38.800,1:36:46.330
Rinaldi still has a chance again this

1:36:42.370,1:36:48.090
has to be a 3.0 as well reverse two and

1:36:46.330,1:36:50.590
a half seven sort with Mike

1:36:48.090,1:36:52.720
you always done really well there

1:36:50.590,1:36:56.010
sneaking the diamond look - so who's

1:36:52.720,1:36:58.510
gonna go over a vertical on the entry

1:36:56.010,1:37:00.490
the hips and bones that needs to get it

1:36:58.510,1:37:03.550
in all good so far great aerial work

1:37:00.490,1:37:06.280
beautiful Pike and Lincoln exit just

1:37:03.550,1:37:07.630
tips over but tries to sneak it in and

1:37:06.280,1:37:09.370
if the judges will let him get away with

1:37:07.630,1:37:11.740
that they might only give him sevens or

1:37:09.370,1:37:16.510
he might sneak some eights interesting

1:37:11.740,1:37:19.750
bodoni judging me seriously I just want

1:37:16.510,1:37:21.430
because you would be a hanger man flog

1:37:19.750,1:37:24.780
of joy to Anu be sticking in there guys

1:37:21.430,1:37:31.390
I spotted that I know your little tricks

1:37:24.780,1:37:34.980
the keyword Jun CAI for China in word

1:37:31.390,1:37:34.980
three and our seller sorts with tuck

1:37:37.170,1:37:50.830
today things going yep it's good and you

1:37:46.780,1:37:53.350
know well he likes it Chinese contingent

1:37:50.830,1:37:55.810
there many of them a big entourage to

1:37:53.350,1:37:58.060
support this team and they of course in

1:37:55.810,1:38:00.010
this contest in twenty five time will be

1:37:58.060,1:38:01.930
looking for six out of six at the moment

1:38:00.010,1:38:03.700
King Kai battling out with the

1:38:01.930,1:38:05.590
restaurant for those semi-final spots

1:38:03.700,1:38:07.330
and that's certainly going to help his

1:38:05.590,1:38:09.280
cause he'll sail over eighty points

1:38:07.330,1:38:10.750
without three point four I've seen it

1:38:09.280,1:38:12.130
better but it doesn't need to be any

1:38:10.750,1:38:17.200
better than that to make it through

1:38:12.130,1:38:19.390
today yeah number one but one in three

1:38:17.200,1:38:21.340
the Chinese now the order has changed

1:38:19.390,1:38:25.180
Acker off off the top spot for the first

1:38:21.340,1:38:29.350
time and China 103 Russia in number two

1:38:25.180,1:38:31.840
with zakharov now Troy do mate who is in

1:38:29.350,1:38:33.760
a very good position to be returning for

1:38:31.840,1:38:36.670
the top a team find nothing goes wrong

1:38:33.760,1:38:38.680
on the final two dives three dives he'll

1:38:36.670,1:38:42.940
be fine in with three and on our summer

1:38:38.680,1:38:44.800
sorts would tuck three point four yeah

1:38:42.940,1:38:46.840
it's good form to mate he is a little

1:38:44.800,1:38:48.790
low on the water some of the other

1:38:46.840,1:38:51.610
divers completing the dive with much

1:38:48.790,1:38:55.360
more time to spare to mate a little bit

1:38:51.610,1:38:56.800
low here we go squeeze one two three can

1:38:55.360,1:38:58.930
see way below the board as he finishes

1:38:56.800,1:39:02.020
but he's so neat and tidy and he sneaks

1:38:58.930,1:39:07.000
it in there well there you go 75 points

1:39:02.020,1:39:11.140
plus I think so we may as you know so

1:39:07.000,1:39:12.670
don't you inbuilt totalize a tour in

1:39:11.140,1:39:16.450
your and your brain doesn't and built

1:39:12.670,1:39:17.890
totally zeta seventy eight point two

1:39:16.450,1:39:19.020
zero I'm not quite sure where that came

1:39:17.890,1:39:23.800
from

1:39:19.020,1:39:25.750
yeah El Castillo cuenta Mexico yes

1:39:23.800,1:39:29.050
having a really good competition

1:39:25.750,1:39:31.620
third place after the last round reverse

1:39:29.050,1:39:37.570
three and a half some shots with tuck

1:39:31.620,1:39:39.730
3.50 yes it's good yes maybe going loose

1:39:37.570,1:39:42.400
in his lower back as he kicked out of

1:39:39.730,1:39:44.980
the dive there so he will not be getting

1:39:42.400,1:39:47.260
nines the aerial works good look at that

1:39:44.980,1:39:49.840
way above the five meter squeeze that

1:39:47.260,1:39:57.040
look just lower back arch there he does

1:39:49.840,1:40:00.970
sneak it in yep little safe passage

1:39:57.040,1:40:03.490
another two dives for yoga studio well

1:40:00.970,1:40:07.510
he's done all the hard work early on so

1:40:03.490,1:40:09.190
we've got a bit of not being quite on

1:40:07.510,1:40:12.610
top of his game now but that should be

1:40:09.190,1:40:15.190
fine it should be okay robert pirès

1:40:12.610,1:40:19.930
overawed Regas reverse three and have

1:40:15.190,1:40:22.720
some sorts for the venezuelan oh well

1:40:19.930,1:40:24.520
done Rodriguez moving around a little

1:40:22.720,1:40:26.140
bit there as he was coming into the end

1:40:24.520,1:40:27.820
I wasn't quite sure where he was going

1:40:26.140,1:40:30.340
to land on the end of the diving board

1:40:27.820,1:40:33.280
but he ended up all right maybe corner

1:40:30.340,1:40:35.560
board on the far side and he plays the

1:40:33.280,1:40:37.150
waiting game and just launched that one

1:40:35.560,1:40:38.920
on his head that'll be his biggest score

1:40:37.150,1:40:40.630
each dive look right on the corner whoa

1:40:38.920,1:40:42.700
we've seen what happens from there

1:40:40.630,1:40:45.910
sometimes but that's a good dive why

1:40:42.700,1:40:48.820
don't we guess see what the marks are

1:40:45.910,1:40:51.889
big smiles from the judges still waiting

1:40:48.820,1:40:53.659
for them to come up on our screen

1:40:51.889,1:40:56.690
and yeah that's a biggest score by a

1:40:53.659,1:40:58.820
long way 63 is previous best 18.5 so

1:40:56.690,1:40:59.630
been deci won't wait for me either well

1:40:58.820,1:41:01.909
no he won't

1:40:59.630,1:41:03.679
and neither should ii cuz he just wanted

1:41:01.909,1:41:05.480
to get that one in he's finishing up the

1:41:03.679,1:41:07.790
competition he's the guy us to wait the

1:41:05.480,1:41:10.280
longest and he just wants to get his

1:41:07.790,1:41:12.320
dives done every work is good on this

1:41:10.280,1:41:13.820
he's a little bit scruffy as he exits to

1:41:12.320,1:41:15.770
dive look at this losing his feet a

1:41:13.820,1:41:18.440
little bit but he does get it together

1:41:15.770,1:41:20.330
on the end it's okay if it gets over 70

1:41:18.440,1:41:23.540
points you'll stay there well there

1:41:20.330,1:41:26.239
abouts so some divers with some work to

1:41:23.540,1:41:31.400
do Michaela I think he'll be there is he

1:41:26.239,1:41:34.820
yeah 17th all right let's find out after

1:41:31.400,1:41:37.090
we see the Bend Ettie score yeah our

1:41:34.820,1:41:41.360
daily office isn't it really tough work

1:41:37.090,1:41:47.889
who's there who's anywhere and who's

1:41:41.360,1:41:50.449
nowhere at this stage after round four

1:41:47.889,1:41:52.969
Ching Kai moves into first place

1:41:50.449,1:41:54.679
Chong in third place Ilya Zakharov still

1:41:52.969,1:41:57.889
looking very consistent near the top

1:41:54.679,1:41:59.929
come ashore to of Ukraine that's the top

1:41:57.889,1:42:03.260
ten and they parties moving into the top

1:41:59.929,1:42:05.500
ten where he deserves to be now who else

1:42:03.260,1:42:08.060
is there and who is not Chris Meers is

1:42:05.500,1:42:11.360
now we don't at the moment see jack law

1:42:08.060,1:42:14.150
on that page Kuznetsov's moved outside

1:42:11.360,1:42:15.650
the top 18 after such a good start as

1:42:14.150,1:42:18.679
well just amazing how the second half

1:42:15.650,1:42:20.869
can undo all the good work Francois in

1:42:18.679,1:42:23.150
will do left has got some work to do as

1:42:20.869,1:42:26.150
have everybody on that scream

1:42:23.150,1:42:28.250
of course we've lost Stefan feck after

1:42:26.150,1:42:30.520
the last round he's not performing

1:42:28.250,1:42:30.520
anymore

1:42:33.480,1:42:40.539
you know idea of this rather beautiful

1:42:38.050,1:42:46.840
Aquatic Center they cost a lot of money

1:42:40.539,1:42:50.619
but it's very very different giving it

1:42:46.840,1:42:52.920
huge plaudits but the diving board is

1:42:50.619,1:42:55.510
exactly the same as it is anywhere else

1:42:52.920,1:42:58.770
three meters he comes

1:42:55.510,1:43:03.159
Ethan Warren's reverse three and a half

1:42:58.770,1:43:07.329
it's a good tie for Warren fit rind and

1:43:03.159,1:43:08.800
he's for dive so far being good diving

1:43:07.329,1:43:10.510
better in training didn't quite land

1:43:08.800,1:43:12.250
with his feet together on the end there

1:43:10.510,1:43:14.860
one foot in front of the other little

1:43:12.250,1:43:17.619
bit peculiar Blee he squares it up

1:43:14.860,1:43:20.349
alright in the end and yeah he just

1:43:17.619,1:43:22.059
needs to continue to get his last dive

1:43:20.349,1:43:22.570
in on his head and he will make it

1:43:22.059,1:43:24.820
through

1:43:22.570,1:43:26.860
steady diving for Warren more to come my

1:43:24.820,1:43:29.139
feet I think from this Australian yeah

1:43:26.860,1:43:32.230
just warming up and again a big smile

1:43:29.139,1:43:36.989
from the Australian so you know as a job

1:43:32.230,1:43:36.989
is virtually done if not quite done yet

1:43:37.170,1:43:45.639
Demi and Sealy of France 19th after

1:43:43.030,1:43:47.770
round four when I was just flirting with

1:43:45.639,1:43:50.289
danger I'm not returning for the top a

1:43:47.770,1:43:52.989
team back three and a half somersaults

1:43:50.289,1:43:56.760
with tuck and we're up there in the high

1:43:52.989,1:43:59.590
tariffs three point five on this one oh

1:43:56.760,1:44:02.409
it's a little bit scruffy and this could

1:43:59.590,1:44:04.449
be good for the home advantage of the

1:44:02.409,1:44:07.690
British boys both of which are fighting

1:44:04.449,1:44:09.610
with this young Frenchman to get into

1:44:07.690,1:44:13.900
the top 18 it's a big dive it's one of

1:44:09.610,1:44:15.550
his biggest 3.5 just a little turn as he

1:44:13.900,1:44:17.289
goes into the water I don't know whether

1:44:15.550,1:44:19.030
the judges will go to town on him and

1:44:17.289,1:44:21.280
buy go to town home I mean take marks

1:44:19.030,1:44:23.980
off if you get seven to seven point five

1:44:21.280,1:44:27.159
so you'll get over seventy which is very

1:44:23.980,1:44:28.420
good for this dive I don't know which

1:44:27.159,1:44:32.550
way it's gonna go for some of these

1:44:28.420,1:44:35.770
divers as expected tight judges think

1:44:32.550,1:44:38.139
seven seventy three point five zero

1:44:35.770,1:44:39.369
after you multiply that with the degree

1:44:38.139,1:44:43.180
of difficulty that's how you get that

1:44:39.369,1:44:45.370
total and just to recall and recap

1:44:43.180,1:44:50.410
you don't get those marks with the lines

1:44:45.370,1:44:53.380
through them included in the score from

1:44:50.410,1:44:58.090
bottom scores multiplied by the degree

1:44:53.380,1:45:03.190
of difficulty now perch on the big one

1:44:58.090,1:45:05.590
the 3.8 forward four and a half yeah

1:45:03.190,1:45:08.140
that's how you do it he makes it look so

1:45:05.590,1:45:10.990
easy and let me just be clear for you

1:45:08.140,1:45:12.910
all at home that is one of the most

1:45:10.990,1:45:14.770
difficult dives possible from the

1:45:12.910,1:45:17.560
3-meter springboard look how he almost

1:45:14.770,1:45:19.750
goes up to 7.5 meters how is that

1:45:17.560,1:45:22.750
possible well it is because her tongue

1:45:19.750,1:45:24.700
has always been that strong we liken him

1:45:22.750,1:45:26.590
to Sir Chris Hoy with the size of his

1:45:24.700,1:45:29.200
thighs in relation to the rest of his

1:45:26.590,1:45:34.380
body and that could get 90 points let's

1:45:29.200,1:45:37.480
see ninety one point two zero eight

1:45:34.380,1:45:40.000
still not happy with it but never happy

1:45:37.480,1:45:42.610
we haven't seen any tens yet any of the

1:45:40.000,1:45:44.500
competitions this week I'm sure we'll

1:45:42.610,1:45:48.130
see them I guess the same isn't final

1:45:44.500,1:45:49.990
surely now because Nets off last dive

1:45:48.130,1:45:52.390
might have done for his chances bass got

1:45:49.990,1:45:54.040
some chance to repair the damage here

1:45:52.390,1:45:57.430
back two and a half somersaults one the

1:45:54.040,1:45:59.530
hard twists that will help that will

1:45:57.430,1:46:01.330
help he's one of the well my

1:45:59.530,1:46:02.830
frontrunners I expected him to see him

1:46:01.330,1:46:04.570
well in the business end of the field

1:46:02.830,1:46:07.480
and instead he's flapping around outside

1:46:04.570,1:46:08.950
the semi-final places so the tape

1:46:07.480,1:46:10.810
holding him together one and a half

1:46:08.950,1:46:12.940
twist two and a half somersaults goes in

1:46:10.810,1:46:14.620
few people asking about the judges

1:46:12.940,1:46:16.270
you're going to D seven marks come up on

1:46:14.620,1:46:18.340
your screen the two highest and two

1:46:16.270,1:46:20.500
lowest are taken away those are the

1:46:18.340,1:46:22.180
marks with the lines through them those

1:46:20.500,1:46:24.040
three marks that count are added

1:46:22.180,1:46:26.170
together multiplied by the degree of

1:46:24.040,1:46:30.030
difficulty to give the total on this

1:46:26.170,1:46:32.710
case of seventy four point two five yes

1:46:30.030,1:46:34.600
questions about the tape as well a lot

1:46:32.710,1:46:35.920
of people ask you about why so many of

1:46:34.600,1:46:37.780
the divers going to be taped up today

1:46:35.920,1:46:39.670
and what the purpose of that is and what

1:46:37.780,1:46:41.800
kind of advantage that is but they all

1:46:39.670,1:46:44.680
address that little later on we've seen

1:46:41.800,1:46:46.060
Daniel a role for the inward three and a

1:46:44.680,1:46:49.390
half somersaults three-point-four

1:46:46.060,1:46:52.630
performed in the Tuck position this time

1:46:49.390,1:46:55.900
oh very nice indeed the young Mexican

1:46:52.630,1:46:57.220
diver coming into Wow I kind of formed

1:46:55.900,1:46:58.840
the Mexicans have been showing I mean

1:46:57.220,1:47:01.510
he's way off the pace at the moment but

1:46:58.840,1:47:02.860
that's a really good dive so let's see

1:47:01.510,1:47:04.510
him with three and a half in the Tuck

1:47:02.860,1:47:06.940
position very good time

1:47:04.510,1:47:10.030
so the taping as I understand is to add

1:47:06.940,1:47:11.500
you know stimulation to the area so if

1:47:10.030,1:47:13.870
you've got a weakness on the lower back

1:47:11.500,1:47:16.600
or a certain area is to add support to

1:47:13.870,1:47:19.030
keep the blood flow in the area and or

1:47:16.600,1:47:20.950
to stimulate it in such a way so the

1:47:19.030,1:47:23.140
diver is very aware of it so to add

1:47:20.950,1:47:24.910
support so much strain going through the

1:47:23.140,1:47:26.590
body that some of the divers need

1:47:24.910,1:47:28.000
holding together the anchors obviously

1:47:26.590,1:47:29.710
needs they're quite obvious you've got

1:47:28.000,1:47:34.990
to support the particular joints but

1:47:29.710,1:47:38.800
along the back just adding in trouble

1:47:34.990,1:47:40.420
well he he made it he made it now I

1:47:38.800,1:47:42.280
think this might be one of the dive

1:47:40.420,1:47:44.200
that's played again in the bloopers tape

1:47:42.280,1:47:46.300
because he swings his arms completely

1:47:44.200,1:47:48.460
the wrong way and I've not seen a diver

1:47:46.300,1:47:50.290
manage to do that before because his

1:47:48.460,1:47:51.970
technique went to absolute part he was

1:47:50.290,1:47:55.960
completely out of balance let's look at

1:47:51.970,1:47:58.210
this jumps here we go Oh arms go forward

1:47:55.960,1:48:00.610
double arm swing and then manages to

1:47:58.210,1:48:03.490
steady himself she asked about gets in

1:48:00.610,1:48:06.460
the tuck and he makes it we saw Steven

1:48:03.490,1:48:09.520
feck absolutely bomb out this young man

1:48:06.460,1:48:10.390
is managed to save it looks like it is

1:48:09.520,1:48:12.400
open

1:48:10.390,1:48:15.070
Wow I'm super impressed well done that

1:48:12.400,1:48:17.040
man wow that's a big dive and he manages

1:48:15.070,1:48:19.480
to make it with a very peculiar

1:48:17.040,1:48:21.190
unorthodox technique really isn't the

1:48:19.480,1:48:25.020
time to do sort must have vinegar pepper

1:48:21.190,1:48:25.020
is it a diving board

1:48:31.330,1:48:37.480
now on Tuesdays our cast rope our Brazil

1:48:35.310,1:48:41.740
here were two and a half several sorts

1:48:37.480,1:48:44.650
with pike yeah say so I'll finish it

1:48:41.740,1:48:47.020
strongly only 3.0 is freeze last Ivan

1:48:44.650,1:48:49.630
for the next two including this one or

1:48:47.020,1:48:51.280
this one in the next one obviously 3.0

1:48:49.630,1:48:53.950
in word two and a half in the pike

1:48:51.280,1:48:56.260
position straight up and down his

1:48:53.950,1:48:58.180
certainly make it through to the

1:48:56.260,1:49:04.120
semi-finals easy dives to finish and

1:48:58.180,1:49:06.280
he's up there over 70 points again yep

1:49:04.120,1:49:08.850
he said well he's a model of consistency

1:49:06.280,1:49:11.140
hasn't really dropped below 70 anyone's

1:49:08.850,1:49:13.300
otherwise everything has been above 70

1:49:11.140,1:49:17.260
in his program so far that's why he'll

1:49:13.300,1:49:23.020
be returning for the semi finals as we

1:49:17.260,1:49:26.500
see in the yoke Malaysian similarly with

1:49:23.020,1:49:28.900
quite the high marks he has been very

1:49:26.500,1:49:33.130
consistent all the way through looking

1:49:28.900,1:49:35.230
to return for a top 18 place oh yes

1:49:33.130,1:49:37.870
certainly will be and obviously still

1:49:35.230,1:49:38.950
one more dive to go for Kenny and that

1:49:37.870,1:49:41.110
went in with three now that's his

1:49:38.950,1:49:43.770
biggest one three point four and he's

1:49:41.110,1:49:43.770
nailed it

1:49:44.490,1:49:49.360
squeezing into that tight shape wow the

1:49:46.690,1:49:52.470
consistency and the quality of diving as

1:49:49.360,1:49:54.730
I expected is through the roof

1:49:52.470,1:49:56.380
making it very tough to make it through

1:49:54.730,1:49:56.980
there's a few of the key players who

1:49:56.380,1:49:58.990
were struggling

1:49:56.980,1:50:00.070
Kenny Yeo is not one of them well he's

1:49:58.990,1:50:04.210
not straight he's a key player and he's

1:50:00.070,1:50:07.480
not struggling he's in the mix and he

1:50:04.210,1:50:09.850
gets 70 6.50 and again he's not been

1:50:07.480,1:50:13.000
lower than seventy one point three and

1:50:09.850,1:50:16.510
any of his dives today Patrick housing

1:50:13.000,1:50:17.980
for Germany 18 Beijing reversed three

1:50:16.510,1:50:18.580
and a half three point five this is

1:50:17.980,1:50:25.830
worth

1:50:18.580,1:50:28.180
oh what a dive yep Patrick as expected

1:50:25.830,1:50:29.830
world-class in everything he does so

1:50:28.180,1:50:32.380
competes on the platform as well as a

1:50:29.830,1:50:34.690
springboard so not many divers do that

1:50:32.380,1:50:37.650
anymore not in this era people tend to

1:50:34.690,1:50:41.650
specialize but Patrick very versatile

1:50:37.650,1:50:44.560
exceptionally talented diver and proving

1:50:41.650,1:50:46.760
so today here on the springboard

1:50:44.560,1:50:50.720
let's see what the judges think about

1:50:46.760,1:50:53.330
that I think it's gonna be waiting for

1:50:50.720,1:50:54.470
confirmation of guess but it gives me a

1:50:53.330,1:50:57.830
confirmation I was looking for eighty

1:50:54.470,1:50:59.780
nine point two five that's by fives best

1:50:57.830,1:51:01.910
dive in terms of marks and likes a

1:50:59.780,1:51:05.510
bragger offs forward two and a half two

1:51:01.910,1:51:08.630
twins yeah it's good pick you off is

1:51:05.510,1:51:09.980
diving consistently look for a moment

1:51:08.630,1:51:11.750
there they needed a little bit more

1:51:09.980,1:51:14.420
height and rotation on that dive but he

1:51:11.750,1:51:16.570
manages to squeeze it in here we are one

1:51:14.420,1:51:22.300
and a half summer sauce up double twist

1:51:16.570,1:51:25.040
and down into the water it's good sevens

1:51:22.300,1:51:28.420
seven point five maybe things a little

1:51:25.040,1:51:28.420
bit lower the water for more than that

1:51:29.290,1:51:35.390
and the marks are seventy four point

1:51:32.390,1:51:36.830
eight zero for procore off thank you

1:51:35.390,1:51:39.910
Andy Walker by the way for the bit of

1:51:36.830,1:51:44.060
information I required the reason that

1:51:39.910,1:51:46.070
Xavier Garcia was getting great applause

1:51:44.060,1:51:48.050
and so much commendation from the

1:51:46.070,1:51:49.940
Canadians he is training in Canada these

1:51:48.050,1:51:52.850
days that will be why even they

1:51:49.940,1:51:54.380
represent Spain thank you for that in

1:51:52.850,1:51:57.020
with three and a half somersaults with

1:51:54.380,1:51:59.500
tuck three point four is the degree of

1:51:57.020,1:51:59.500
difficulty

1:52:00.760,1:52:08.600
nice let's go javi that's really good

1:52:04.300,1:52:11.680
working hard and it's paying off he's in

1:52:08.600,1:52:14.600
good shape so good performances all year

1:52:11.680,1:52:17.120
squeezing in tuck shape bending at the

1:52:14.600,1:52:18.350
hips bending at the knees in these kind

1:52:17.120,1:52:20.240
of spins it's really important that the

1:52:18.350,1:52:22.040
divers dry their hands you see the small

1:52:20.240,1:52:23.960
towels that you see them throwing about

1:52:22.040,1:52:25.400
the place that's for drying their hands

1:52:23.960,1:52:27.260
and their bodies to keep the warm in

1:52:25.400,1:52:28.790
between dives but also to keep their

1:52:27.260,1:52:30.260
grip on the legs when they're spinning

1:52:28.790,1:52:32.510
around because you do not want to slip

1:52:30.260,1:52:35.270
out that's a good dive eighty-one yep

1:52:32.510,1:52:37.190
and I'll see the training regime he

1:52:35.270,1:52:38.990
seemed to have him kind of looks working

1:52:37.190,1:52:41.300
tears benefit because he's in a

1:52:38.990,1:52:44.300
comfortable position right now

1:52:41.300,1:52:45.830
after that dive now Chris Cole well in

1:52:44.300,1:52:48.800
with three and a half somersaults with

1:52:45.830,1:52:50.420
tuck three point four smile disappearing

1:52:48.800,1:52:52.940
just for a moment for the Americans face

1:52:50.420,1:52:55.810
but he's really been enjoying his

1:52:52.940,1:52:55.810
campaign so far

1:52:56.349,1:53:02.510
yep smiling at the back of the board in

1:52:59.109,1:53:04.090
concentration as soon as you set foot to

1:53:02.510,1:53:07.189
walk to the end of the diving board

1:53:04.090,1:53:09.289
concentration face game face Carl will

1:53:07.189,1:53:11.030
probably one of his more difficult with

1:53:09.289,1:53:12.439
in fact his more difficult dive but he's

1:53:11.030,1:53:15.649
just struggle with this one a little bit

1:53:12.439,1:53:18.469
because he's so tall he does a good job

1:53:15.649,1:53:20.269
that he'll only squeeze sevens I think

1:53:18.469,1:53:21.649
he want more than that as he progresses

1:53:20.269,1:53:22.550
but he'll certainly be featuring in the

1:53:21.649,1:53:24.619
semi-final

1:53:22.550,1:53:26.599
yeah just case of booking your place

1:53:24.619,1:53:28.849
from the top 18 none of these marks get

1:53:26.599,1:53:30.289
carried forward to the semi-finals and

1:53:28.849,1:53:32.780
indeed the same applies to the

1:53:30.289,1:53:36.079
semi-final to the final there just a

1:53:32.780,1:53:38.689
case of hooking your place to return

1:53:36.079,1:53:42.109
tomorrow so if you're hearing noises off

1:53:38.689,1:53:43.780
from the ecology box distracting for us

1:53:42.109,1:53:46.459
I'm sure for the divers as well

1:53:43.780,1:53:50.030
ITA Ross eight back two and a half

1:53:46.459,1:53:52.820
summer sorts with Mike yeah Ross a is

1:53:50.030,1:53:54.169
such a performer I'm sure if you can

1:53:52.820,1:53:56.840
cast your mind back to earlier in this

1:53:54.169,1:53:58.879
contest where it was nearly all over for

1:53:56.840,1:54:02.359
this young Frenchman he has come back

1:53:58.879,1:54:05.209
and for dive after dive yeah he's a

1:54:02.359,1:54:08.809
strong diver this is only 3.0 to grave

1:54:05.209,1:54:11.809
difficulty but he does it very well

1:54:08.809,1:54:13.489
indeed and he'll certainly be going

1:54:11.809,1:54:15.879
through to the semi-finals and he's one

1:54:13.489,1:54:15.879
to watch

1:54:17.139,1:54:26.619
69 for Ross a 8.02 7.5 look overly tough

1:54:24.520,1:54:29.110
with it but it's good enough and he'll

1:54:26.619,1:54:30.760
be back for more in the semi-finals this

1:54:29.110,1:54:35.500
man that moment though will not France

1:54:30.760,1:54:37.239
why in BO du Lac of Canada for two and

1:54:35.500,1:54:39.159
half somersaults two twists Pike

1:54:37.239,1:54:47.500
position three point four degree of

1:54:39.159,1:54:49.179
difficulty 21st after round oh that's

1:54:47.500,1:54:51.219
one of his Bennett dives and I should

1:54:49.179,1:54:53.770
think so too because he actually ups the

1:54:51.219,1:54:55.449
ante on his final round dive this is the

1:54:53.770,1:54:58.389
forward two and a half somersaults with

1:54:55.449,1:54:59.500
two twists let's look at the replay into

1:54:58.389,1:55:01.420
the end of the time for one and a half

1:54:59.500,1:55:04.030
somersaults to twist really quickly

1:55:01.420,1:55:05.469
easily done into the water he saw before

1:55:04.030,1:55:07.869
he goes there closing his eyes

1:55:05.469,1:55:09.730
visualizing his dive leaving his

1:55:07.869,1:55:11.199
visualization quite late lots of divers

1:55:09.730,1:55:12.850
use visualization but I've never seen

1:55:11.199,1:55:15.580
someone do it right on the diving board

1:55:12.850,1:55:18.250
just before they go anyway that's one of

1:55:15.580,1:55:19.960
his best performances so far because I

1:55:18.250,1:55:22.980
should say round after round four he was

1:55:19.960,1:55:24.940
in 21st place is now in 10th place

1:55:22.980,1:55:26.530
zakharov prepares for his for

1:55:24.940,1:55:27.219
two-and-a-half summer sorts with three

1:55:26.530,1:55:30.159
twists

1:55:27.219,1:55:33.090
oh it's a big dive it is the world's

1:55:30.159,1:55:35.290
most difficult dive on the springboard

1:55:33.090,1:55:37.570
3.92 grave difficulty you're only good

1:55:35.290,1:55:40.210
to see a a couple of the guys doing this

1:55:37.570,1:55:41.920
with one two three twists oh I don't

1:55:40.210,1:55:44.409
know how you get out of that alive but

1:55:41.920,1:55:45.969
he does little bit short of vertical bit

1:55:44.409,1:55:48.460
because of the degree of difficulty that

1:55:45.969,1:55:51.130
could get him 80 points seven six and a

1:55:48.460,1:55:53.619
half seven but it's a big big degree of

1:55:51.130,1:55:55.630
difficulty high risk and he him/her

1:55:53.619,1:55:57.369
Chong and one of two others are going to

1:55:55.630,1:55:58.780
attempt that dive and he really rushed

1:55:57.369,1:56:00.429
into there as well though there was no

1:55:58.780,1:56:02.080
preparation diverse as soon as he got

1:56:00.429,1:56:04.780
the the go from the ref he was he was

1:56:02.080,1:56:06.760
off there and surprise me with it with a

1:56:04.780,1:56:08.770
degree of difficulty that that has

1:56:06.760,1:56:10.570
attached to it 3.9 that he wouldn't have

1:56:08.770,1:56:13.719
actually spent a bit more time over it

1:56:10.570,1:56:16.090
but she dives it his way now Alex de

1:56:13.719,1:56:20.110
Partie for three and a half somersaults

1:56:16.090,1:56:22.059
Pike 3.1 Alex up into 10th he prepares

1:56:20.110,1:56:26.770
to dive number 5

1:56:22.059,1:56:28.480
yeah it's good font a party does he have

1:56:26.770,1:56:30.369
enough degree of difficulty to challenge

1:56:28.480,1:56:31.449
again for his third Olympic medal only

1:56:30.369,1:56:34.360
time will tell

1:56:31.449,1:56:36.070
this is simple lots of the divers still

1:56:34.360,1:56:38.710
using this so for three and a half in

1:56:36.070,1:56:40.420
the pike position that's tipping over a

1:56:38.710,1:56:43.030
vertical as he goes in there it'll still

1:56:40.420,1:56:47.889
get eight eight and a half's I think so

1:56:43.030,1:56:50.980
technically proficient really really

1:56:47.889,1:56:53.170
good yeah it was a kid you saw in 1998

1:56:50.980,1:56:56.440
the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia being

1:56:53.170,1:56:58.119
carried head high by Tony Ali remember

1:56:56.440,1:57:00.130
that yeah well I came third in that

1:56:58.119,1:57:02.110
competition and he was the winner so yes

1:57:00.130,1:57:04.570
I do remember how pretty toy sorry to

1:57:02.110,1:57:07.389
bring that early on that's dinner offer

1:57:04.570,1:57:11.889
tonight them seventy seven point five

1:57:07.389,1:57:14.349
zero four day party Ilya Kumasi back two

1:57:11.889,1:57:18.099
and a half somersaults to Round four he

1:57:14.349,1:57:20.650
was in fourth place 3.0 attached to it

1:57:18.099,1:57:22.510
oh it needed to be a little bit better

1:57:20.650,1:57:24.610
than that you can see the taping on the

1:57:22.510,1:57:26.530
back there was another diver just jumps

1:57:24.610,1:57:28.690
into well that's Jack actually preparing

1:57:26.530,1:57:31.329
himself for his next dive here we are on

1:57:28.690,1:57:33.010
the replay no need to squeeze into the

1:57:31.329,1:57:34.599
pike a little bit deeper there just let

1:57:33.010,1:57:35.980
him go a little early arching through

1:57:34.599,1:57:38.650
the lower back obviously quite a

1:57:35.980,1:57:41.170
sensitive area taping on the feet as

1:57:38.650,1:57:44.289
well it's like action men being held

1:57:41.170,1:57:47.050
together by duct tape anyway he's still

1:57:44.289,1:57:49.059
in and still with a fighting chance yeah

1:57:47.050,1:57:51.250
I think it'd be okay wasn't a great mark

1:57:49.059,1:57:54.280
but it's pretty much done all the hard

1:57:51.250,1:57:58.109
work up to this stage and providing he

1:57:54.280,1:57:59.949
doesn't do a Stefan effect he's okay

1:57:58.109,1:58:03.069
sebastien Castaneda

1:57:59.949,1:58:07.260
is upping his degree of difficulty a 3.5

1:58:03.069,1:58:10.149
reverse three and a half with 22nd oh

1:58:07.260,1:58:12.309
what a dive very good from the young

1:58:10.149,1:58:14.709
Colombian only 20 years old this is his

1:58:12.309,1:58:16.839
big dive this is the one where all the

1:58:14.709,1:58:18.999
risk is going to be and actually that's

1:58:16.839,1:58:21.099
his best diver of the contest squeezing

1:58:18.999,1:58:24.159
into that touch shape rotating very

1:58:21.099,1:58:28.260
quickly pops it on his head that will

1:58:24.159,1:58:33.620
probably be his high scoring dive so far

1:58:28.260,1:58:37.049
and it is seventy five point two five

1:58:33.620,1:58:40.059
[Applause]

1:58:37.049,1:58:46.209
you heard the noise before you see the

1:58:40.059,1:58:48.729
diver diver bring the team gb trunks yes

1:58:46.209,1:58:51.909
Chris Meers it was enjoying this and

1:58:48.729,1:58:55.359
enjoy even more if he gets through in

1:58:51.909,1:59:00.039
the top 18 at the moment he is in 16th

1:58:55.359,1:59:05.559
place Christmas in word three and a half

1:59:00.039,1:59:08.499
somersaults with tuck around right

1:59:05.559,1:59:10.989
steady it's a little bit short as he

1:59:08.499,1:59:14.439
goes in everyone's on their feet though

1:59:10.989,1:59:17.739
the Team GB scarf the Union flag being

1:59:14.439,1:59:21.189
waved massive support here for Chris

1:59:17.739,1:59:24.489
Meers inward three and a half squeezes

1:59:21.189,1:59:27.099
in seven 7.5 s it could have been eight

1:59:24.489,1:59:28.319
and eight point five C Peter just waited

1:59:27.099,1:59:31.059
a little bit longer

1:59:28.319,1:59:34.209
dives in Southampton with Lindsey phrase

1:59:31.059,1:59:36.639
the same coaches Peter Waterfield so

1:59:34.209,1:59:40.029
could dive from Christmas he'll stay in

1:59:36.639,1:59:41.319
the all-important top 18 yes yeah 13th

1:59:40.029,1:59:45.249
of the moment but there's quite a few

1:59:41.319,1:59:50.499
divers still to go good lock him down a

1:59:45.249,1:59:54.909
peg or two to the Malaysian as we

1:59:50.499,1:59:56.289
mentioned used to die for China going

1:59:54.909,1:59:58.179
towards the end of his career has

1:59:56.289,2:00:00.129
switched to relays as part of the

1:59:58.179,2:00:03.219
synchro team the other day in with three

2:00:00.129,2:00:04.869
and a half I said pick one when he

2:00:03.219,2:00:08.739
needed it

2:00:04.869,2:00:11.440
big dive 3.4 and that's his best I've so

2:00:08.739,2:00:14.280
far showing his experience performing

2:00:11.440,2:00:18.130
under pressure the weight of expectation

2:00:14.280,2:00:22.570
that'll get close to 80 points high 70s

2:00:18.130,2:00:26.619
at least it's a good dive stepping up

2:00:22.570,2:00:29.080
when he needs to why the old memory bank

2:00:26.619,2:00:33.250
works doesn't it who did that

2:00:29.080,2:00:36.179
all that I was diving for China and now

2:00:33.250,2:00:39.670
he's doing it for Malaysia as well

2:00:36.179,2:00:41.800
Michael Oher time is running out for

2:00:39.670,2:00:45.699
qualification for him just two more

2:00:41.800,2:00:47.460
rounds 3.5 degree of difficulty back

2:00:45.699,2:00:51.760
three and a half somersaults with tuck

2:00:47.460,2:00:56.320
jack not quite cast adrift yet 25th

2:00:51.760,2:01:02.770
place study concentration on this and

2:00:56.320,2:01:05.020
not what dive for Jack law oh he's

2:01:02.770,2:01:07.540
having such a tough day it's one of his

2:01:05.020,2:01:11.260
better ties but really this young man

2:01:07.540,2:01:13.960
young boy 17 years old is so much better

2:01:11.260,2:01:15.880
than this this is straighting watching I

2:01:13.960,2:01:20.139
can only imagine what his coach Haidee

2:01:15.880,2:01:22.179
is feeling oh it's a big dive it's on

2:01:20.139,2:01:24.639
his head it's gonna sneak sevens it's

2:01:22.179,2:01:27.010
gonna get close to 70 points maybe just

2:01:24.639,2:01:29.619
over 70 points but it's not good enough

2:01:27.010,2:01:32.290
to move him up the field enough to get

2:01:29.619,2:01:36.690
in the top 80 what a tough day for Jack

2:01:32.290,2:01:43.780
oh come on he's only got one more dive

2:01:36.690,2:01:49.179
to come on time and dives marks running

2:01:43.780,2:01:56.440
out rapidly for him Savannah's Poppa

2:01:49.179,2:01:58.000
RunAs grease qualification went wrong in

2:01:56.440,2:01:59.440
the previous route here is with his

2:01:58.000,2:02:05.260
reverse three and a half several sorts

2:01:59.440,2:02:08.679
with tuck get your surfboard tape the

2:02:05.260,2:02:10.150
surf is up yeah the coach said no and

2:02:08.679,2:02:10.770
that's what happens these are difficult

2:02:10.150,2:02:13.179
dives

2:02:10.770,2:02:15.340
such a shame here we go on the end of

2:02:13.179,2:02:17.080
the diving board squeezing into the Tuck

2:02:15.340,2:02:18.550
shape as he spins backwards towards a

2:02:17.080,2:02:22.239
diving board just lets go where

2:02:18.550,2:02:25.929
too late here comes the splash maybe

2:02:22.239,2:02:30.550
back towards the diving board there we

2:02:25.929,2:02:33.909
go whoops-a-daisy not going to be his

2:02:30.550,2:02:39.579
date no representation for Greece in the

2:02:33.909,2:02:41.770
Sony files it would seem now the Italian

2:02:39.579,2:02:46.719
here also has some work to do in that

2:02:41.770,2:02:48.190
part of the field out where to pick up

2:02:46.719,2:02:49.869
big marks reverse two-and-a-half

2:02:48.190,2:02:56.949
somersaults one and a half twist for an

2:02:49.869,2:02:58.750
Aldi Bernal DS okay really afford to be

2:02:56.949,2:03:00.309
giving away any points and he's a little

2:02:58.750,2:03:01.869
short as he goes in the water there this

2:03:00.309,2:03:03.489
is one of his bigger ties three point

2:03:01.869,2:03:07.869
three there's a one and a half twist

2:03:03.489,2:03:09.130
into the two and a half somersaults yeah

2:03:07.869,2:03:10.719
needed to be a little bit better than

2:03:09.130,2:03:16.210
seventh I think and that's what you'll

2:03:10.719,2:03:19.739
get for that short just a little bit you

2:03:16.210,2:03:24.579
say real Cheltenham then R you said sure

2:03:19.739,2:03:27.150
that's a mouse-over and LD with yeah I

2:03:24.579,2:03:30.610
kind of look that says might not be

2:03:27.150,2:03:32.559
tomorrow for me there we go a big dive

2:03:30.610,2:03:34.119
this is huge three point eight two

2:03:32.559,2:03:35.889
forward four and a half quite the three

2:03:34.119,2:03:37.239
point nine we saw previously but three

2:03:35.889,2:03:46.179
point eight four with four and a half

2:03:37.239,2:03:50.250
watching kya current leader just goes to

2:03:46.179,2:03:52.659
show that even the Chinese can go

2:03:50.250,2:03:55.059
disastrously wrong you do not see that

2:03:52.659,2:03:57.280
very often making a real mess up of his

2:03:55.059,2:03:58.570
hurdle step she asked about stays on the

2:03:57.280,2:04:00.550
end of the diving board one foot

2:03:58.570,2:04:02.650
slipping off this is three point eight

2:04:00.550,2:04:04.030
you can't do this off a poor start oh

2:04:02.650,2:04:06.460
there we go

2:04:04.030,2:04:07.960
Wow did he complete the dive he did

2:04:06.460,2:04:10.000
complete the dive it's fine it's only

2:04:07.960,2:04:12.309
gonna get sore I don't know I give that

2:04:10.000,2:04:13.719
a - two and a half maybe interesting to

2:04:12.309,2:04:16.510
see what the judges do that because they

2:04:13.719,2:04:19.119
would not be expecting that one and a

2:04:16.510,2:04:21.219
half to four come on Joe it's ridiculous

2:04:19.119,2:04:23.170
that is a ridiculous spread I'm sorry

2:04:21.219,2:04:26.020
are you watching that is a ridiculous

2:04:23.170,2:04:28.079
spread that doesn't make any sense you

2:04:26.020,2:04:32.320
know the judges were confused but anyway

2:04:28.079,2:04:35.450
let's see I'm confused by the judges

2:04:32.320,2:04:37.610
Troy do make reverse three and a half

2:04:35.450,2:04:43.820
summer sorts we're tuck anything could

2:04:37.610,2:04:46.400
happen of this competitions too may

2:04:43.820,2:04:49.340
bring it back on track nailing his

2:04:46.400,2:04:52.370
reverse three and a half yeah it's all

2:04:49.340,2:04:54.740
about consistency and that is what Troy

2:04:52.370,2:04:57.050
to me has been displaying every time he

2:04:54.740,2:04:59.270
set foot on the diving board so far

2:04:57.050,2:05:03.920
these Olympic Games that's another good

2:04:59.270,2:05:05.990
dive they'll get way over 80 points and

2:05:03.920,2:05:07.550
so it should well here we go what's

2:05:05.990,2:05:09.740
gonna happen in the final round just a

2:05:07.550,2:05:11.840
few more divers of this round and then

2:05:09.740,2:05:13.610
the drama of the final round

2:05:11.840,2:05:15.020
well he's said all right he's been quite

2:05:13.610,2:05:17.000
consistent all the way through us his

2:05:15.020,2:05:21.230
biggest mark of the day eighty five

2:05:17.000,2:05:23.570
point seven five four troy do make such

2:05:21.230,2:05:29.450
a poetic doesn't realize that yeah he

2:05:23.570,2:05:30.530
Castillo well top of Mexico hope is back

2:05:29.450,2:05:32.180
somewhere I can get chance to say it

2:05:30.530,2:05:33.860
again backward two-and-a-half summer

2:05:32.180,2:05:37.490
sorts with bike I need three point zero

2:05:33.860,2:05:40.070
on this one yeah this is one of his

2:05:37.490,2:05:41.900
weaker dives all divers have to do a

2:05:40.070,2:05:43.880
dive in a different direction so all

2:05:41.900,2:05:46.160
five groups must be covered this is the

2:05:43.880,2:05:49.250
backwards group backward two and a half

2:05:46.160,2:05:50.960
somersaults the owl opting for only 3.0

2:05:49.250,2:05:53.360
lots of the divers opting for this one

2:05:50.960,2:05:55.040
and I've seen it better than that but

2:05:53.360,2:05:57.500
I've also seen it a lot worse so I don't

2:05:55.040,2:05:59.120
think that's gonna break 70 points which

2:05:57.500,2:06:04.370
is where he really needs to be if he

2:05:59.120,2:06:08.930
wants to stay with the big boys at sixty

2:06:04.370,2:06:09.920
seven point five zero for wetter I'll

2:06:08.930,2:06:13.580
show you what you're talking about half

2:06:09.920,2:06:15.890
the time well Robert spires of Rodriguez

2:06:13.580,2:06:18.740
going for a reverse two and a half some

2:06:15.890,2:06:23.000
thoughts one artists from Venezuela 28th

2:06:18.740,2:06:24.760
after Round four and that's not going to

2:06:23.000,2:06:28.610
see him move up from that kind of

2:06:24.760,2:06:31.190
placing in the standings he's only 18

2:06:28.610,2:06:33.140
years old the second youngest only

2:06:31.190,2:06:35.330
person young and enemies Jack Jack lore

2:06:33.140,2:06:35.780
from Team GB who's having a tough day at

2:06:35.330,2:06:38.480
the office

2:06:35.780,2:06:40.130
this guy's a bit well all over the place

2:06:38.480,2:06:43.639
in the nicest possible way but he's

2:06:40.130,2:06:46.369
young and he's got plenty of learning

2:06:43.639,2:06:51.079
plenty of training to go before he gets

2:06:46.369,2:06:52.729
that consistency 57 point 75 and he's

2:06:51.079,2:06:56.860
got one more dive to come and that will

2:06:52.729,2:06:59.389
be it and it will be goodbye for him

2:06:56.860,2:07:01.340
Michaela been detie give me a bit more

2:06:59.389,2:07:02.989
time to introduce him this time reverse

2:07:01.340,2:07:05.059
two and a half somersaults with one

2:07:02.989,2:07:08.989
after us Mike position three point three

2:07:05.059,2:07:12.079
degree of difficulty as a crucial dive

2:07:08.989,2:07:14.389
for Michaela and he's made it kind

2:07:12.079,2:07:16.070
always difficult right at the end of the

2:07:14.389,2:07:18.229
field you have to wait and wait and wait

2:07:16.070,2:07:20.389
and wait and watch all the other divers

2:07:18.229,2:07:21.979
Lodge their scores and then you need to

2:07:20.389,2:07:25.340
come out and responded Mickey has done

2:07:21.979,2:07:28.300
just that he's landed on his head he'll

2:07:25.340,2:07:34.159
get 7008 and so he should

2:07:28.300,2:07:35.599
it's a good dive like electrode pads on

2:07:34.159,2:07:38.149
his lower back suffering a little bit

2:07:35.599,2:07:40.550
with lower back pain so plug him into

2:07:38.149,2:07:43.219
the electricity and and help him out I

2:07:40.550,2:07:45.559
think he's a bit of a battery charge but

2:07:43.219,2:07:47.539
that might be okay 18th place so he's in

2:07:45.559,2:07:53.719
the very last qualification place after

2:07:47.539,2:07:55.149
that dive end of round five and here is

2:07:53.719,2:07:58.429
how it looks

2:07:55.149,2:08:00.079
Chong did you see what they were the

2:07:58.429,2:08:03.739
other Chinese is now after that last

2:08:00.079,2:08:06.469
dive russia USA germany mexico ukraine

2:08:03.739,2:08:09.169
USA again malaysia Canada Spain now

2:08:06.469,2:08:13.909
where's the second Chinese there they go

2:08:09.169,2:08:15.949
in Levin and Chris Mears is in as you

2:08:13.909,2:08:19.130
see on your screen no place and them

2:08:15.949,2:08:21.349
over Jack lon McKenney Ben Betty is

2:08:19.130,2:08:24.619
getting the last arm the position to the

2:08:21.349,2:08:26.599
moment but that's quite tight because

2:08:24.619,2:08:29.479
that stuff won't be back when we think

2:08:26.599,2:08:31.969
stand or caster dado Renaldi or indeed

2:08:29.479,2:08:33.079
jack law of Great Britain and step in

2:08:31.969,2:08:34.189
fact in case you're wondering why he

2:08:33.079,2:08:38.199
didn't see him he pulled out the

2:08:34.189,2:08:38.199
competition after round two

2:08:39.719,2:08:43.950
that's after round three I think it was

2:08:47.340,2:08:52.110
lots of the crowds still here and Jack

2:08:49.410,2:08:54.090
lore has got a lot to do on his last

2:08:52.110,2:08:55.710
dive I think he might have left himself

2:08:54.090,2:08:57.750
too much to do

2:08:55.710,2:08:59.370
he needs to dive of his life to

2:08:57.750,2:09:04.110
entertain this home crowd Christmas

2:08:59.370,2:09:07.290
still in the mix this is the first I've

2:09:04.110,2:09:10.230
final round of the men's 3-meter

2:09:07.290,2:09:12.240
springboard preliminary it's Ethan

2:09:10.230,2:09:15.600
Warren on Australia for two and a half

2:09:12.240,2:09:19.350
somersaults to twist pike 3.4 degree of

2:09:15.600,2:09:22.230
difficulty yet he's been steady this

2:09:19.350,2:09:25.110
evening the challenges these divers all

2:09:22.230,2:09:28.140
now need to well go back to the Olympic

2:09:25.110,2:09:29.790
Village have a bite to eat go to bed

2:09:28.140,2:09:31.350
try and get to sleep because they've got

2:09:29.790,2:09:33.210
to do it all again the next morning well

2:09:31.350,2:09:35.460
18 of them have and I'm pretty sure that

2:09:33.210,2:09:39.990
this young man Ethan Warren of Australia

2:09:35.460,2:09:43.230
will be one of those we'll see he has

2:09:39.990,2:09:45.720
this round progresses when the big Q

2:09:43.230,2:09:47.490
comes alongside their name who's

2:09:45.720,2:09:48.480
qualified will tell you that as it

2:09:47.490,2:09:49.860
appears on our screen

2:09:48.480,2:09:53.070
Ethan Warren is pretty much in there

2:09:49.860,2:09:57.420
without too much difficulty for 41.50

2:09:53.070,2:10:00.720
should get it done for him Tammy and C D

2:09:57.420,2:10:02.220
of France though in 20th place needs to

2:10:00.720,2:10:05.240
improve with the reverse two-and-a-half

2:10:02.220,2:10:08.070
summer sorts from one and a half twists

2:10:05.240,2:10:10.380
well like he was driving a bus a little

2:10:08.070,2:10:12.390
bit then so arms going everywhere

2:10:10.380,2:10:14.340
swinging around a little bit in his Pike

2:10:12.390,2:10:15.780
shape it wasn't the elegant twist and

2:10:14.340,2:10:17.880
into the pike that were used to seeing

2:10:15.780,2:10:20.850
here we go look one and a half twist

2:10:17.880,2:10:23.370
just walk shoulders shoulders shoulders

2:10:20.850,2:10:26.070
and he goes and that may help jack law

2:10:23.370,2:10:28.950
because he is level pegging with him

2:10:26.070,2:10:31.050
currently a little weak dive to finish

2:10:28.950,2:10:35.550
there a weaker dive to finish there from

2:10:31.050,2:10:38.810
this Frenchman Wow drama his case no

2:10:35.550,2:10:38.810
more room on top

2:10:40.170,2:10:45.870
60 1.05 that could be a wave goodbye

2:10:43.440,2:10:50.850
because he looks like he's not going to

2:10:45.870,2:10:54.090
be returning for the top 18 her chunk

2:10:50.850,2:10:57.960
thought about is actually it really

2:10:54.090,2:10:59.040
flunking in that fifth round I've got a

2:10:57.960,2:11:01.560
concern himself well that's an

2:10:59.040,2:11:04.080
individual competition and he's doing

2:11:01.560,2:11:07.320
pretty fine thank you in first place

2:11:04.080,2:11:09.330
after around five yeses for

2:11:07.320,2:11:15.540
two-and-a-half somersaults with three

2:11:09.330,2:11:17.790
twists in the pike position oh it's yeah

2:11:15.540,2:11:20.400
it's good I'm so impressed with this

2:11:17.790,2:11:21.810
dive he does always just split his legs

2:11:20.400,2:11:23.400
just before he goes here women show

2:11:21.810,2:11:25.620
their sixth time in Olympic medal it's

2:11:23.400,2:11:27.420
just a little bit confused as to why her

2:11:25.620,2:11:28.560
teammate did that he's the triple twist

2:11:27.420,2:11:30.989
just to might get it done and then

2:11:28.560,2:11:32.730
splits his legs they guys a bit here and

2:11:30.989,2:11:34.920
there on the finish it might get over 80

2:11:32.730,2:11:39.390
points I think you'll need to be better

2:11:34.920,2:11:41.880
than that that's a little bit of a safe

2:11:39.390,2:11:43.140
so he kind of gets in and then rolls in

2:11:41.880,2:11:44.820
the water there to give the impression

2:11:43.140,2:11:48.060
of being up by but he asked you if as he

2:11:44.820,2:11:50.340
goes in yeah he doesn't like it like

2:11:48.060,2:11:53.489
that does he temper temper eighty three

2:11:50.340,2:11:55.199
point eight five for her Chong so always

2:11:53.489,2:11:58.650
perfection with a Chinese anything less

2:11:55.199,2:12:01.910
is not acceptable okay because that's

2:11:58.650,2:12:01.910
off 21st

2:12:02.360,2:12:08.730
oh and he's gone for it he has been a

2:12:07.199,2:12:10.199
bit here and there during this

2:12:08.730,2:12:14.010
preliminary and that's his biggest dive

2:12:10.199,2:12:16.290
three point eight and he's done a very

2:12:14.010,2:12:18.510
good job on it now will it be enough

2:12:16.290,2:12:19.730
he's got that blue tape holding him

2:12:18.510,2:12:22.860
together

2:12:19.730,2:12:24.660
now has he held it together enough to

2:12:22.860,2:12:27.690
get through that's gonna be a big big

2:12:24.660,2:12:30.330
score to finish let's see how that

2:12:27.690,2:12:31.860
affects his total marks now we get to

2:12:30.330,2:12:33.630
see the mark just before he comes up on

2:12:31.860,2:12:35.280
your screen that's why I went oh sorry

2:12:33.630,2:12:38.989
kind of preempted the ninety one point

2:12:35.280,2:12:38.989
two zero you see on the screen I think

2:12:39.770,2:12:47.390
four fourteen forty that is good so that

2:12:43.230,2:12:49.770
may will be enough Daniel Arroyo of

2:12:47.390,2:12:51.449
Mexico however need something similar

2:12:49.770,2:12:53.150
and he's got a forward four and a half

2:12:51.449,2:12:56.690
somersaults

2:12:53.150,2:13:01.270
point-eight tuck 24th after around 5:00

2:12:56.690,2:13:03.710
this has to be pretty much spot-on oh

2:13:01.270,2:13:05.990
it's a good day I've just letting the

2:13:03.710,2:13:08.060
dive go over as he goes into the water

2:13:05.990,2:13:11.060
but that's not a surprise because it's

2:13:08.060,2:13:12.830
so difficult to do good hurdle step

2:13:11.060,2:13:15.650
landing right on the end up up and away

2:13:12.830,2:13:18.400
way above the five meter beautiful TUC

2:13:15.650,2:13:20.720
shape and that's one of his best dives

2:13:18.400,2:13:22.280
just letting the dive get over a

2:13:20.720,2:13:26.690
vertical which means you'll get less

2:13:22.280,2:13:30.560
than sevens probably judges say the

2:13:26.690,2:13:31.790
spread they're five up to seven when

2:13:30.560,2:13:36.350
judge didn't like it the rest of the

2:13:31.790,2:13:41.240
judges were in were consistent where's

2:13:36.350,2:13:43.940
Brad job or Venezuela 27th and again I'm

2:13:41.240,2:13:45.800
likely to return this is spectacular

2:13:43.940,2:13:47.180
three point three your verse two and a

2:13:45.800,2:13:49.790
half somersaults one and a half -

2:13:47.180,2:13:52.460
where's he's gone again now what happens

2:13:49.790,2:13:54.290
now okay so that is a technical restart

2:13:52.460,2:13:56.300
you can see the crowd getting behind the

2:13:54.290,2:13:59.630
athletes and what will happen the diver

2:13:56.300,2:14:01.550
will perform the dive as stated he will

2:13:59.630,2:14:03.020
be marked out of ten by each of the

2:14:01.550,2:14:05.300
judges and then there will be a

2:14:03.020,2:14:08.360
two-point deduction from each of the

2:14:05.300,2:14:10.100
judges before it's multiplied by the

2:14:08.360,2:14:11.480
degree of difficulty so you will not see

2:14:10.100,2:14:13.640
that on screen you would just see it in

2:14:11.480,2:14:15.500
the total score the reason he stopped is

2:14:13.640,2:14:18.380
because he was all over the shop again

2:14:15.500,2:14:20.120
on his hurdle step we have seen some

2:14:18.380,2:14:22.670
drama haven't we hear from this guy in

2:14:20.120,2:14:27.890
particular the last dive he made it

2:14:22.670,2:14:33.470
without this arm swing hurdle step again

2:14:27.890,2:14:35.120
oh that is a real calamity an absolute

2:14:33.470,2:14:36.320
shambles actually let's call it what it

2:14:35.120,2:14:38.390
is he's going to get two points

2:14:36.320,2:14:40.760
deduction from the war scores which are

2:14:38.390,2:14:42.440
going to be really really low what an

2:14:40.760,2:14:45.470
absolute shame we've seen it all today

2:14:42.440,2:14:46.880
we've seen Steven feck have to pull out

2:14:45.470,2:14:48.380
of the competition because he slipped

2:14:46.880,2:14:51.620
off the diving board and failed his dive

2:14:48.380,2:14:54.290
we've seen this guy stop get the restart

2:14:51.620,2:14:56.000
and then Wow because he got the tension

2:14:54.290,2:14:58.520
on the board wrong this is me way too

2:14:56.000,2:15:01.130
much movement on that no no no he's just

2:14:58.520,2:15:03.590
an awful take off nope he said yeah look

2:15:01.130,2:15:05.780
at that a total of four point nine five

2:15:03.590,2:15:06.050
I've not seen a dive score that low he's

2:15:05.780,2:15:08.570
too

2:15:06.050,2:15:13.400
draw ever that's actually ok of course

2:15:08.570,2:15:18.559
oh you got a feel for him absolutely

2:15:13.400,2:15:22.659
distraught hmm the ups and downs

2:15:18.559,2:15:22.659
literally of diving

2:15:22.909,2:15:29.210
I think you'll be consolable for quite

2:15:25.580,2:15:32.210
some time competition moves on however

2:15:29.210,2:15:33.949
we assess our caste rope our Brazil

2:15:32.210,2:15:38.690
reverse two-and-a-half summer sorts with

2:15:33.949,2:15:40.820
pike oh it's a very good dive to finish

2:15:38.690,2:15:44.449
from stays I needed to be he's only just

2:15:40.820,2:15:46.210
in the semi-final spot if you like so he

2:15:44.449,2:15:50.719
was 15 after the five rounds

2:15:46.210,2:15:52.820
this is 3.0 he is doing his dives very

2:15:50.719,2:15:54.650
well indeed it he needs to low degree of

2:15:52.820,2:15:59.300
difficulty in comparison to some of the

2:15:54.650,2:16:01.610
other divers very elegant quite a tall

2:15:59.300,2:16:03.710

2:16:05.719,2:16:11.830
441 there's a lot of iron that school

2:16:31.010,2:16:35.179
Kenny he's rocking and rolling he's

2:16:33.320,2:16:39.080
straight through to the semi-finals

2:16:35.179,2:16:41.510
eight after the fifth round and yeah

2:16:39.080,2:16:44.090
good performance from this young man

2:16:41.510,2:16:45.769
today I say young man young man of 29

2:16:44.090,2:16:47.710
years old one of the oldest competitors

2:16:45.769,2:16:52.550
that he was on the money today

2:16:47.710,2:16:56.149
consistent that's what you need to be he

2:16:52.550,2:17:00.939
has been a model of consistency 71 81 70

2:16:56.149,2:17:04.099
to 79 76 and another 72 to round it off

2:17:00.939,2:17:06.260
we welcoming Ken back to the semi-finals

2:17:04.099,2:17:08.149
as I think we will be providing goes

2:17:06.260,2:17:13.120
untoward here Patrick how's things

2:17:08.149,2:17:13.120
reverse two and a half somersaults twist

2:17:13.479,2:17:18.830
Wow water dive should have made a bit

2:17:16.700,2:17:20.599
more of a fuss of this one three point

2:17:18.830,2:17:22.670
seven degree of difficulty he's actually

2:17:20.599,2:17:24.740
adding a twist to what a lot of the

2:17:22.670,2:17:27.649
other divers here two and a half twist

2:17:24.740,2:17:30.439
two and a half somersaults three point

2:17:27.649,2:17:32.899
seven it's a huge dive and that'll

2:17:30.439,2:17:35.240
easily get over 80 points because of the

2:17:32.899,2:17:37.219
degree of difficulty and that's housing

2:17:35.240,2:17:39.830
through Stephen feck

2:17:37.219,2:17:41.510
out yeah waiting for the cues to come

2:17:39.830,2:17:43.099
beside the names I haven't actually

2:17:41.510,2:17:45.349
happened as yet but well because we've

2:17:43.099,2:17:47.210
got so many competitors 29 of them but I

2:17:45.349,2:17:49.399
think you can safely assume that Patrick

2:17:47.210,2:17:56.109
Houston will return I'll go out on a

2:17:49.399,2:18:00.080
limb and actually rig or off 13th place

2:17:56.109,2:18:02.689
margin for error on this one boy looked

2:18:00.080,2:18:04.489
like he was gonna do a bit of a marginal

2:18:02.689,2:18:07.099
error but he managed to hang on played

2:18:04.489,2:18:09.769
the waiting game he could sense that his

2:18:07.099,2:18:11.330
rotation was a little bit slow here we

2:18:09.769,2:18:12.620
go up here's the one and a half twist

2:18:11.330,2:18:13.910
and then he squeezed didn't think so

2:18:12.620,2:18:16.429
hang on a minute I'm spinning slow I

2:18:13.910,2:18:19.059
better bury my face in my shins and hang

2:18:16.429,2:18:22.819
on for the ride which is what he does

2:18:19.059,2:18:32.000
just about gets in there up he diverts

2:18:22.819,2:18:33.410
anything 69 point three zero what you go

2:18:32.000,2:18:35.630
through on the poor side watching your

2:18:33.410,2:18:37.130
teammates or your sons or daughters yes

2:18:35.630,2:18:43.729
you can't influence what's going on up

2:18:37.130,2:18:46.880
there just Garcia's last dive nice dive

2:18:43.729,2:18:48.979
to finish from have a reverse one and a

2:18:46.880,2:18:50.809
half somersaults three and a half twist

2:18:48.979,2:18:54.139
this is a classic dive this is what we

2:18:50.809,2:18:55.609
used to see ten years ago longer before

2:18:54.139,2:18:57.290
the multiple somersault multiple twists

2:18:55.609,2:18:58.849
came in but this is a beautiful dive it

2:18:57.290,2:19:01.099
is three point four now degree of

2:18:58.849,2:19:03.109
difficulty and have he making it count

2:19:01.099,2:19:04.429
there nice dive to finish would've been

2:19:03.109,2:19:06.290
that long ago 20 years ago all the

2:19:04.429,2:19:10.870
divers would have used this dive last

2:19:06.290,2:19:14.960
two dives both the same mark 81 0.26 0

2:19:10.870,2:19:19.910
no product placement here thank you for

2:19:14.960,2:19:21.800
60 point 3 5 from him Crisco will hate

2:19:19.910,2:19:23.540
the room knife here in February when he

2:19:21.800,2:19:25.910
took power this competition 1 Grand Prix

2:19:23.540,2:19:26.870
win this year in Fort Lauderdale on his

2:19:25.910,2:19:28.849
way to the semis

2:19:26.870,2:19:31.969
if the reverse three and a half works to

2:19:28.849,2:19:35.300
his advantage 3.5 degree of difficulty

2:19:31.969,2:19:38.510
oh yeah what a die foam core will to

2:19:35.300,2:19:40.609
finish it's a big one reverse three and

2:19:38.510,2:19:41.840
a half lot can go wrong and we've seen

2:19:40.609,2:19:45.050
that already for many of the other

2:19:41.840,2:19:47.469
competitors but core will making no

2:19:45.050,2:19:49.100
mistakes there on his final dive

2:19:47.469,2:19:51.229
beautiful dive

2:19:49.100,2:19:58.010
will it get 80 points and

2:19:51.229,2:20:00.590
you'll be too far away yes it does

2:19:58.010,2:20:02.569
eighty point five zero eight ten seven

2:20:00.590,2:20:04.970
point five remind you if you are late

2:20:02.569,2:20:07.159
coming to this all the marks with lines

2:20:04.970,2:20:08.630
through them do not count bottom marks

2:20:07.159,2:20:10.909
top marks disappear

2:20:08.630,2:20:12.800
it's the ones in the middle row say his

2:20:10.909,2:20:15.829
final forward two and a half seven sort

2:20:12.800,2:20:17.840
to twist well well say they come back

2:20:15.829,2:20:20.359
King just missing his hands he goes in

2:20:17.840,2:20:22.039
there throwing up too much splash but he

2:20:20.359,2:20:25.310
fought his way back into the top

2:20:22.039,2:20:27.109
eighteen after a complete calamity on

2:20:25.310,2:20:29.810
his second round I've I think it was

2:20:27.109,2:20:31.220
it's unusual to get the charges missing

2:20:29.810,2:20:32.840
his hands as he went in throwing up a

2:20:31.220,2:20:36.109
bit of splash on his forward two and a

2:20:32.840,2:20:37.850
half there to twist this guy has got

2:20:36.109,2:20:39.350
lots to offer and I'm glad to see him

2:20:37.850,2:20:41.149
going through to the semi-final cuz if

2:20:39.350,2:20:42.590
he's on he's gonna be up there look at

2:20:41.149,2:20:44.329
that just saying to his coach he clapped

2:20:42.590,2:20:47.420
his hands he went in that's why there

2:20:44.329,2:20:49.489
was lots of splash 4:45 not the most

2:20:47.420,2:20:51.050
animated of divers doesn't need to meet

2:20:49.489,2:20:52.819
and save all that kind of stuff for

2:20:51.050,2:20:54.890
tomorrow once he knows he's through and

2:20:52.819,2:20:59.300

five made up a couple of places so knows

2:21:01.220,2:21:06.800
he's almost there but this is huge

2:21:02.930,2:21:11.109
3.9 degree of difficulty for two and a

2:21:06.800,2:21:14.890
half somersaults three twists hold on

2:21:11.109,2:21:14.890
this could be a bumpy ride

2:21:16.601,2:21:25.240
oh I do not believe it that is

2:21:21.000,2:21:26.860

2:21:33.670,2:21:37.330
triple twist he's at least saved his

2:21:35.740,2:21:40.721
best til last and that's gonna get

2:21:37.330,2:21:42.551
massive score wow I was not expecting

2:21:40.721,2:21:43.990
that I was expecting to how I could hear

2:21:42.551,2:21:45.551
the helicopters overhead and I was

2:21:43.990,2:21:48.070
thinking of a helicopter joke to poop

2:21:45.551,2:21:50.051
but no need for a helicopter joke

2:21:48.070,2:21:52.240

Olympic silver medalist in this event he

2:22:59.110,2:23:05.051
knows he needs to dive better that'll

2:23:01.301,2:23:06.940
get him enough to get through and if he

a great deal of pluck and vigour and

2:23:19.990,2:23:25.990
courage as he always does and he'll be

2:23:39.670,2:23:44.760
really good dive yeah attack in the end

2:23:42.460,2:23:50.311
of the diving board really really strong

2:23:44.760,2:23:52.570
out doubleTwist completing the dive

2:23:50.311,2:23:55.960
super smooth entry into the water with a

2:23:52.570,2:23:58.480
rip 80 points plus and a secure place in

2:23:55.960,2:23:59.830
the semi-final early tomorrow morning

2:23:58.480,2:24:02.320
it's pretty harsh isn't it tomorrow

2:23:59.830,2:24:06.101
morning let's confirm who's there Zakhar

2:24:02.320,2:24:09.971
off her Chong house ding kabocha Colwell

2:24:06.101,2:24:11.681
garcia de Partie all with queues beside

2:24:09.971,2:24:13.630
their names there will be many more

2:24:11.681,2:24:16.510
shortly but they are all definitely

2:24:13.630,2:24:18.880
through mathematically they cannot be

2:24:16.510,2:24:24.730
overtaken so all those seven have made

2:24:18.880,2:24:26.710
it through now cast Anita 22nd in with

2:24:24.730,2:24:28.420
three and a half somersaults with tuck

2:24:26.710,2:24:30.340
three point four degree of difficulty

2:24:28.420,2:24:32.101
Mike just agreed himself a little bit

2:24:30.340,2:24:35.230
too much to do

2:24:32.101,2:24:36.580
yeah just rolling over the diaper this

2:24:35.230,2:24:39.400
is what happens these competitions are

2:24:36.580,2:24:40.900
so long people start to to lose it a

2:24:39.400,2:24:44.170
little bit maybe it's concentration

2:24:40.900,2:24:46.391
maybe it's fatigue some divers raising

2:24:44.170,2:24:48.490
their game others faltering this young

2:24:46.391,2:24:50.681
man only 20 years old he'll be back

2:24:48.490,2:24:53.471
again and you could sit here the crowd

2:24:50.681,2:24:54.250
behind me as I'm speaking because who's

2:24:53.471,2:25:02.400
up next

2:24:54.250,2:25:04.570
can you guess destiny no fishes in 300

2:25:02.400,2:25:05.830
checking those marks again was to get

2:25:04.570,2:25:09.971
off the screen forget chance given to

2:25:05.830,2:25:12.880
you 400 sorry 413 at point six zero now

2:25:09.971,2:25:14.351
Chris Meers this is the big one a very

2:25:12.880,2:25:16.650
big one this will be the difference

2:25:14.351,2:25:21.971
between you making that semi final and

2:25:16.650,2:25:24.130
not I can hardly watch forward four and

2:25:21.971,2:25:29.410
a half somersaults we talk big degree of

2:25:24.130,2:25:30.670
difficulty 3.8 Christmas oh yes I think

2:25:29.410,2:25:33.431
it's going to be good enough

2:25:30.670,2:25:36.460
the Crider behind him Tom and Stacey

2:25:33.431,2:25:38.650
Sarah fellow teammates on their feet

2:25:36.460,2:25:42.070
that's a good dive it's his biggest

2:25:38.650,2:25:43.730
degree of difficulty 3.8 we've seen lot

2:25:42.070,2:25:46.250
for the other divers naylet we've seen

2:25:43.730,2:25:48.801
some of the divers falter Chris does tip

2:25:46.250,2:25:50.961
over vertical so in the splash up a

2:25:48.801,2:25:51.471
little bit away from you he does a good

2:25:50.961,2:25:54.381
job

2:25:51.471,2:25:58.030
hopefully that is enough it's not going

2:25:54.381,2:26:01.480
to get more than seven unfortunately but

2:25:58.030,2:26:05.740
I'm hoping that it doesn't get sevens

2:26:01.480,2:26:08.750
6.5 for Chris Meers doesn't get seventh

2:26:05.740,2:26:12.700
mmm got mark down there maybe just a tad

2:26:08.750,2:26:23.181
maybe worse being a bit term jingoistic

2:26:12.700,2:26:26.591
good word nice finishing strongly was in

2:26:23.181,2:26:29.181
17th yes 17th after the fifth round

2:26:26.591,2:26:32.360
functions experience is a big dive three

2:26:29.181,2:26:34.011
point four oh wow

2:26:32.360,2:26:36.650
this is going to be tight for those

2:26:34.011,2:26:39.971
remaining spots and this guy is

2:26:36.650,2:26:42.471
certainly in the hunt for one of those

2:26:39.971,2:26:43.671
well let's see is mark so now tell me

2:26:42.471,2:26:48.320
who else has definitely made the

2:26:43.671,2:26:51.261
semi-finals after this seventy-three

2:26:48.320,2:26:53.841
point one zero in boudu lakh and Ross a

2:26:51.261,2:26:58.761
latest names with a queue beside their

2:26:53.841,2:27:03.620
names I mean say top 10 are confirmed

2:26:58.761,2:27:06.921
eight places still to go for definite or

2:27:03.620,2:27:10.030
slightly forlorn look on his face

2:27:06.921,2:27:12.771
because something three point four

2:27:10.030,2:27:14.721
really has to be at the top of his game

2:27:12.771,2:27:15.230
here for two and a half somersaults to

2:27:14.721,2:27:17.681
twist

2:27:15.230,2:27:17.681
oh dear

2:27:21.290,2:27:26.270
he's just had well what happened there

2:27:24.189,2:27:30.250
landed on the end of the diving board

2:27:26.270,2:27:33.470
completely almost slipped off mistimed

2:27:30.250,2:27:35.149
there we go just buckles knees buckle

2:27:33.470,2:27:37.939
web for the big one there's no rotation

2:27:35.149,2:27:41.450
nothing he can do he just wants to swim

2:27:37.939,2:27:43.970
away wants to to disappear I really

2:27:41.450,2:27:46.580
really feel from he's only 17 he's got

2:27:43.970,2:27:48.680
so much potential that happens in

2:27:46.580,2:27:52.850
training you could Annie buckle

2:27:48.680,2:27:54.140
completely and I I really feel fun

2:27:52.850,2:27:56.779
there's nothing he could do

2:27:54.140,2:28:00.200
he's had a really bad day he's had an

2:27:56.779,2:28:02.270
awful day of diving he failed his failed

2:28:00.200,2:28:04.939
his last dive my goodness can't wait to

2:28:02.270,2:28:07.100
go chasing after him I think he'll be

2:28:04.939,2:28:09.979
long gone because he just want to get

2:28:07.100,2:28:16.640
out of here you have to understand why

2:28:09.979,2:28:18.020
that would be mr. fallows pepper unas in

2:28:16.640,2:28:21.439
with two and a half somersaults with

2:28:18.020,2:28:23.689
Pike for the Greek it's a wonderful dive

2:28:21.439,2:28:27.109
for the Greek to finish on one of his

2:28:23.689,2:28:29.300
easier dives again the 3.0 and he's

2:28:27.109,2:28:30.080
executed it just with precision this is

2:28:29.300,2:28:32.990
what we're looking for

2:28:30.080,2:28:35.090
rip entries into the water his aerial

2:28:32.990,2:28:36.920
work is good you can't see any light or

2:28:35.090,2:28:38.750
daylight in between the chest and the

2:28:36.920,2:28:39.380
thighs and he rips the entries going to

2:28:38.750,2:28:44.060
get eights

2:28:39.380,2:28:46.640
it's good but not good for Jack wow I'm

2:28:44.060,2:28:49.819
still reeling after watching that Castro

2:28:46.640,2:28:51.620
and Warren are the latest ones have cues

2:28:49.819,2:28:53.930
beside their name so they are through as

2:28:51.620,2:28:56.720
well so we now know 12 of the 18 for

2:28:53.930,2:28:59.000
definite so the few more competitors to

2:28:56.720,2:29:02.600
go yet boat before we can confirm the 18

2:28:59.000,2:29:05.689
but up to Warren they are all definitely

2:29:02.600,2:29:07.010
back few people waiting to see what

2:29:05.689,2:29:12.160
happens when the remaining dives

2:29:07.010,2:29:13.939
including Chris Meers Tommaso Rinaldi of

2:29:12.160,2:29:15.800
Italy in with three and a half

2:29:13.939,2:29:19.040
somersaults with top 20 third place

2:29:15.800,2:29:20.561
after dive number five here's his final

2:29:19.040,2:29:24.790
attempt

2:29:20.561,2:29:27.511
I think that's more he's left himself a

2:29:24.790,2:29:30.521
bit much to do that needed to be more

2:29:27.511,2:29:32.771
more points and it's gonna get just

2:29:30.521,2:29:34.630
running out of room in with three and a

2:29:32.771,2:29:36.370
half is his biggest dive you can just

2:29:34.630,2:29:38.800
see here finishing low on the water not

2:29:36.370,2:29:40.690
quite straightening out enough what will

2:29:38.800,2:29:44.200
he get I don't know five and a half six

2:29:40.690,2:29:46.120
and a half seven maybe I don't know it's

2:29:44.200,2:29:48.790
yeah I'm gonna say with this election of

2:29:46.120,2:29:50.800
judges anything's possible let's see

2:29:48.790,2:29:52.450
what they think five point five up to

2:29:50.800,2:29:53.830
seven point five looking at two point

2:29:52.450,2:30:00.820
differential there but anything ones

2:29:53.830,2:30:02.530
without what I said over them count cuz

2:30:00.820,2:30:04.000
that's not by the way he's got another

2:30:02.530,2:30:09.790
one of the berths

2:30:04.000,2:30:13.050
for the semi-finals chink I unbelievably

2:30:09.790,2:30:17.261
after round fun after almost failed dive

2:30:13.050,2:30:18.700
that wasn't his best either but it's

2:30:17.261,2:30:20.170
good enough eleventh he'll make it

2:30:18.700,2:30:21.730
through to the top eighteen some of his

2:30:20.170,2:30:23.771
teammates they're a bit confused as to

2:30:21.730,2:30:27.190
what's going on as we were in the

2:30:23.771,2:30:28.721
commentary box taping on the toes the

2:30:27.190,2:30:30.311
explanation for that is that toes get

2:30:28.721,2:30:31.570
worn out the diving board has actually

2:30:30.311,2:30:33.490
got a lot of grip on it's a bit like

2:30:31.570,2:30:35.351
sandpaper not quite as harsh as

2:30:33.490,2:30:37.450
sandpaper but when you're doing dive

2:30:35.351,2:30:39.460
after dive after dive after dive it does

2:30:37.450,2:30:41.261
rub away at you toes so a lot of the

2:30:39.460,2:30:44.261
divers using tape on their toes just to

2:30:41.261,2:30:47.261
replace the skin I guess seventy four

2:30:44.261,2:30:50.510
point two five not a happy bunny at all

2:30:47.261,2:30:52.550
but he's gonna be back for more

2:30:50.510,2:30:55.610
an improvement definitely required from

2:30:52.550,2:31:00.970
Ching Kai for a medal and the final

2:30:55.610,2:31:03.470
takes place on Tuesday night Troy Dumais

2:31:00.970,2:31:06.290
forward to and a half somersaults two

2:31:03.470,2:31:08.270
twists Pike position three point four

2:31:06.290,2:31:13.840
he's done pretty much all the hard works

2:31:08.270,2:31:16.690
just to the ended on his qualification

2:31:13.840,2:31:19.700
well he certainly does it in fine style

2:31:16.690,2:31:21.440
puts the tin lid on his qualification I

2:31:19.700,2:31:22.970
like that saying I put that into my

2:31:21.440,2:31:25.160
repertoire

2:31:22.970,2:31:27.200
here we go Fordham a very consistent

2:31:25.160,2:31:30.010
he'll be right up there in the top three

2:31:27.200,2:31:32.540
with that fantastic diving from the

2:31:30.010,2:31:35.570
already cried Olympic medalist earlier

2:31:32.540,2:31:37.340
in the week and he certainly deserves

2:31:35.570,2:31:42.830
his spot through in the semi finals

2:31:37.340,2:31:45.950
tomorrow morning yeah the chink I try do

2:31:42.830,2:31:48.770
mate is also qualified so we know 15 of

2:31:45.950,2:31:51.530
them now only three more to be or this

2:31:48.770,2:31:54.350
is agony for Chris Meers agony because

2:31:51.530,2:31:58.130
he knows he's not definitely guaranteed

2:31:54.350,2:32:01.940
a place yet it was semi-finals yeah

2:31:58.130,2:32:05.510
Castillo Webster two and a half twist

2:32:01.940,2:32:08.350
Pike three point three to finish yep

2:32:05.510,2:32:11.690
he's in no worries for y'all

2:32:08.350,2:32:13.220
I've seen him dive better two years ago

2:32:11.690,2:32:14.450
I thought he was gonna be the next big

2:32:13.220,2:32:18.580
thing hasn't quite lived up to his

2:32:14.450,2:32:20.870
potential as yet so let's wait and see

2:32:18.580,2:32:22.880
what he's got in store for us tomorrow

2:32:20.870,2:32:25.490
morning at the semi-finals and then if

2:32:22.880,2:32:28.880
that all goes well in the final later on

2:32:25.490,2:32:32.000
tomorrow night local time easily making

2:32:28.880,2:32:35.300
it through steady set of dives yeah very

2:32:32.000,2:32:38.120
impressive serve dives indeed good

2:32:35.300,2:32:40.190
effort by the Mexican and he is through

2:32:38.120,2:32:46.820
to the moment Chris Meers is an 18th

2:32:40.190,2:32:48.530
place he's got the last one I enrolled

2:32:46.820,2:32:51.140
is Rodriguez doesn't do something

2:32:48.530,2:32:53.300
spectacular should remain in 18th place

2:32:51.140,2:32:57.090
for two and a half somersaults two

2:32:53.300,2:33:00.240
twists Mike position for him

2:32:57.090,2:33:06.270
I finishes on a good one the young 18

2:33:00.240,2:33:07.439
year old from Venezuela I think he's had

2:33:06.270,2:33:10.080
a really good time today I've been

2:33:07.439,2:33:13.080
watching him in between dives smiling

2:33:10.080,2:33:15.300
away just taking in going wow I am in

2:33:13.080,2:33:17.760
the Olympic Games I'm doing what I love

2:33:15.300,2:33:19.590
to do I'm diving you know I'm not gonna

2:33:17.760,2:33:21.689
make it through maybe but I'm gonna give

2:33:19.590,2:33:26.760
it my all and that's exactly what

2:33:21.689,2:33:29.910
Rodriguez has done today it's only 1.40

2:33:26.760,2:33:38.460
and I think Chris Meers is gonna be just

2:33:29.910,2:33:42.270
about okay well not quite because if

2:33:38.460,2:33:44.460
this is around 74 Vendetti Mears is gone

2:33:42.270,2:33:47.130
for two-and-a-half somersaults to twist

2:33:44.460,2:33:50.430
pike 3.14 he misses entry as well

2:33:47.130,2:33:51.870
no his entry is spot-on but his arm

2:33:50.430,2:33:54.149
swing was all over the shop he nearly

2:33:51.870,2:33:56.729
missed his takeoff but his entry was

2:33:54.149,2:33:58.290
good Wow he's holding his head he knows

2:33:56.729,2:34:01.470
how close this is gonna be as well

2:33:58.290,2:34:03.060
cheers to bikes squares it up on the end

2:34:01.470,2:34:05.070
of the diving board completes the dive

2:34:03.060,2:34:07.109
it's a forward two and a half two twists

2:34:05.070,2:34:08.850
Wow I don't know which way this is going

2:34:07.109,2:34:09.750
to go it's going to be tough closest

2:34:08.850,2:34:12.960
either Benedetti

2:34:09.750,2:34:13.920
in or out Mia's in or out which way is

2:34:12.960,2:34:16.770
it going to go

2:34:13.920,2:34:20.700
and the newzeas benedetti has missed

2:34:16.770,2:34:22.920
down in 20th place the Italian got that

2:34:20.700,2:34:26.700
all wrong in terms of preparation and

2:34:22.920,2:34:30.030
that has opened the door for the home

2:34:26.700,2:34:34.350
favorite Chris Meers just and I mean

2:34:30.030,2:34:37.380
just to sneak into 18th place no place

2:34:34.350,2:34:40.080
for Jack lure the Chris Meers has made

2:34:37.380,2:34:44.130
it and that's the agonized face on

2:34:40.080,2:34:46.500
Mackay Leben deathy who knows he is not

2:34:44.130,2:34:48.240

better tomorrow mate but he's there

2:35:05.970,2:35:10.420
for what a competition that was just

2:35:09.040,2:35:13.840
getting our breasts back that was

2:35:10.420,2:35:15.970
extraordinary seen everything after

2:35:13.840,2:35:17.380
somebody god forbid hitting their head

2:35:15.970,2:35:19.690
on the diving or we've seen everything

2:35:17.380,2:35:21.430
in that competition it just shows the

2:35:19.690,2:35:24.100
heartbreak this is how much it means to

2:35:21.430,2:35:26.020
these athletes Mickey there didn't dive

2:35:24.100,2:35:27.730
as well as he won into today and just

2:35:26.020,2:35:30.730
ended up on the wrong side of that top

2:35:27.730,2:35:32.140
18 gutting for him fantastic news for

2:35:30.730,2:35:34.720
the other divers who have made it

2:35:32.140,2:35:37.870
through right then these are the ones

2:35:34.720,2:35:40.360
who will return top 18 pretty much all

2:35:37.870,2:35:42.010
the names you might expect although

2:35:40.360,2:35:45.580
there's only one Chinese at the top

2:35:42.010,2:35:47.860
there because of a bit of an aberration

2:35:45.580,2:35:49.660
by the other but he will return on page

2:35:47.860,2:35:52.060

Meers qualifies by less than three

2:36:04.360,2:36:08.800
points in the end and the Malaysian

2:36:06.100,2:36:11.230
misses out as does bent deti but 18th

2:36:08.800,2:36:13.930
place crispy is for Great Britain and

2:36:11.230,2:36:14.950
all these I'll be thinking about what

2:36:13.930,2:36:18.700
they're going to do with the rest of

2:36:14.950,2:36:20.770
their week Jack law included of that

2:36:36.820,2:36:42.101
what an extraordinary competition we

2:36:39.580,2:36:43.900
can't expect that kind I would I say

2:36:42.101,2:36:46.330
calamities but that kind of excitement

2:36:43.900,2:36:50.440
and a range of emotions surely in the

2:36:46.330,2:36:53.141
semi-final well I don't know let's see

2:36:50.440,2:36:55.061
e18 divers have made it through I'm very

2:36:53.141,2:36:58.540
surprised not to see Jack Lauper and I'm

2:36:55.061,2:37:00.761
sure he feels absolutely devastated me

2:36:58.540,2:37:02.110
as did a great job so did many of the

2:37:00.761,2:37:04.271
other divers there were some fantastic

2:37:02.110,2:37:04.960
dives but lots of things happen this is

2:37:04.271,2:37:06.431
what it's about

2:37:04.960,2:37:08.530
you've got to make it through the

2:37:06.431,2:37:10.690
polymer rounds you make it through but

2:37:08.530,2:37:12.521
then of course everything goes to zero

2:37:10.690,2:37:14.920
so it doesn't matter whether you're he

2:37:12.521,2:37:17.080
Chong or Chris Meers everyone starts at

2:37:14.920,2:37:19.271
zero in the semi-finals they've got to

2:37:17.080,2:37:22.391
get to bed tonight they've got to get

2:37:19.271,2:37:23.920
some sleep if they can and get up early

2:37:22.391,2:37:25.750
tomorrow morning to come in and train

2:37:23.920,2:37:27.601

2:37:25.750,2:37:30.431

2:37:30.431,2:37:34.271

2:37:32.710,2:37:36.460
whatever you want but don't be anywhere

2:37:34.271,2:37:39.011
