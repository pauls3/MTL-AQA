0:00:00.439,0:00:04.440
quite how they got the tickets but they

0:00:02.370,0:00:06.839
did well to do so and they're here we're

0:00:04.440,0:00:09.719
waiting for a big step up in class from

0:00:06.839,0:00:12.889
Paolo Espinosa Sanchez bronze medalist

0:00:09.719,0:00:16.500
of the world championships last year

0:00:12.889,0:00:21.510
know me bat key of Italy fall in Hungary

0:00:16.500,0:00:26.340
but now representing Italy you earlier

0:00:21.510,0:00:28.769
forgot Chuck of the Ukraine no the

0:00:26.340,0:00:30.900
second of the Canadians again looking

0:00:28.769,0:00:32.460
for a slightly better performance you'll

0:00:30.900,0:00:34.590
need it if she wants to make it into the

0:00:32.460,0:00:36.750
top 12 which is where we will be at the

0:00:34.590,0:00:38.899
end of this session and now full of

0:00:36.750,0:00:41.850
beans full of life and full of words

0:00:38.899,0:00:43.950
Katie Bell of the USA watch her

0:00:41.850,0:00:47.899
preparation for every dive we have a

0:00:43.950,0:00:47.899
little chat on the chanter to herself

0:00:48.440,0:00:56.340
my leg Ogawa of japan into the last

0:00:54.660,0:00:58.500
seven now this is the order in which

0:00:56.340,0:01:00.329
they will dive five rounds of dives

0:00:58.500,0:01:04.830
remember in the women's Yulia

0:01:00.329,0:01:07.760
Martin over there's the two Chinese is

0:01:04.830,0:01:07.760
yeah bamboo

0:01:10.030,0:01:16.119
woman's 10-meter platform semi-final

0:01:13.659,0:01:18.729
they're just introducing the 18 who made

0:01:16.119,0:01:20.979
it through from an original list of 26

0:01:18.729,0:01:23.080
sadly from a British point of view no

0:01:20.979,0:01:25.900
representation Stacy Powell didn't make

0:01:23.080,0:01:28.149
it through Northey monic cladding she

0:01:25.900,0:01:31.000
was 19th last night so she missed out on

0:01:28.149,0:01:34.000
that last remaining place christian ster

0:01:31.000,0:01:36.070
of germany had a exceptional performance

0:01:34.000,0:01:39.250
last night Leon Taylor as Emma is

0:01:36.070,0:01:42.190
alongside me the 10 metre synchro silver

0:01:39.250,0:01:43.869
medalist from 2004 in Athens I think

0:01:42.190,0:01:45.420
it's safe to say Leon the standard last

0:01:43.869,0:01:48.280
night left a little bit to be desired

0:01:45.420,0:01:49.929
yeah it seemed to me that not many of

0:01:48.280,0:01:53.080
these ladies willing to make it through

0:01:49.929,0:01:55.869
to this semi-final that shown rule in

0:01:53.080,0:01:58.420
the Olympic champion only 15 years old

0:01:55.869,0:02:00.909
four years ago in Beijing tops the field

0:01:58.420,0:02:03.009
or top the field by a huge margin by the

0:02:00.909,0:02:05.020
end of the proceedings last night it's a

0:02:03.009,0:02:07.720
tough program for these young ladies

0:02:05.020,0:02:09.190
they are on again and they didn't finish

0:02:07.720,0:02:11.319
until late last night they were still

0:02:09.190,0:02:12.970
diving close to 10 p.m. obviously back

0:02:11.319,0:02:16.090
to the Olympic Village have something to

0:02:12.970,0:02:18.160
eat to rest try and turn your adrenaline

0:02:16.090,0:02:20.019
down to get some sleep and then get back

0:02:18.160,0:02:22.570
up early this morning to come in and

0:02:20.019,0:02:24.820
practice your dies from the mighty 10

0:02:22.570,0:02:26.799
metre platform their towering above all

0:02:24.820,0:02:29.680
the other diving boards this is the dive

0:02:26.799,0:02:32.739
order once again and of course the girls

0:02:29.680,0:02:35.560
do five dives each of those dives counts

0:02:32.739,0:02:37.360
and it's the total score which mean you

0:02:35.560,0:02:39.940
know you make it through you don't top

0:02:37.360,0:02:41.890
12 go through to this evening's final so

0:02:39.940,0:02:42.340
it's a lot of diving in a short space of

0:02:41.890,0:02:44.470
time

0:02:42.340,0:02:46.540
who is the fittest and who can hold it

0:02:44.470,0:02:48.609
together mentally last night

0:02:46.540,0:02:50.500
lots of faltering will we see the same

0:02:48.609,0:02:53.560
this morning I think we might see one or

0:02:50.500,0:02:54.970
two what about Monica cladding it was a

0:02:53.560,0:02:56.320
surprise to some actually she even

0:02:54.970,0:02:58.420
competed last night because she had a

0:02:56.320,0:03:00.160
quite serious injury she did what an

0:02:58.420,0:03:02.530
absolute shame money cladding finishing

0:03:00.160,0:03:04.630
19th Stacy Powell 20th so they're both

0:03:02.530,0:03:06.340
reserve one and reserve two but none of

0:03:04.630,0:03:08.590
the ladies ahead of them have been

0:03:06.340,0:03:10.570
injured in the meantime and so they're

0:03:08.590,0:03:12.970
watching on the pool side thinking what

0:03:10.570,0:03:15.340
if money cladding of course hitting a

0:03:12.970,0:03:18.340
head on the diving board in Russia only

0:03:15.340,0:03:20.830
just over a year ago and yeah

0:03:18.340,0:03:22.269
fortunately knocking as well she knocked

0:03:20.830,0:03:23.840
herself out sunk to the bottom the pool

0:03:22.269,0:03:26.870
rescued by her teammate

0:03:23.840,0:03:28.760
Robeson Baker a truly dramatic story an

0:03:26.870,0:03:31.129
inspirational story how she came back

0:03:28.760,0:03:33.769
and made the Olympic Games team at the

0:03:31.129,0:03:36.410
age of 31 her first Olympic Games such a

0:03:33.769,0:03:39.260
shame to see her not featuring today in

0:03:36.410,0:03:42.049
the semi-final alongside Stacy Powell as

0:03:39.260,0:03:44.810
well having a tough day in the diving

0:03:42.049,0:03:47.959
pool meaning reserve one and reserve -

0:03:44.810,0:03:49.910
what a shame right so just say how this

0:03:47.959,0:03:51.140
works in case you're new to diving and

0:03:49.910,0:03:53.030
haven't seen our coverage up to this

0:03:51.140,0:03:54.799
point the marks will appear on your

0:03:53.030,0:03:56.599
screen all the marks that have lines

0:03:54.799,0:03:58.489
through them will not count towards a

0:03:56.599,0:04:00.620
totally in other words the top and

0:03:58.489,0:04:03.290
bottom marks are discarded the three in

0:04:00.620,0:04:05.090
the middle will be taken as their marks

0:04:03.290,0:04:07.160
and they will be multiplied by the

0:04:05.090,0:04:09.829
degree of difficulty now in most cases

0:04:07.160,0:04:11.480
in the first round it will be 3.0 we

0:04:09.829,0:04:13.459
might go down into the twos we do go

0:04:11.480,0:04:15.709
down for the twos we only go as high in

0:04:13.459,0:04:17.479
the women's as opposed to the men's Leon

0:04:15.709,0:04:19.039
as three point three yeah let me just

0:04:17.479,0:04:21.079
explain the degree of difficulty is

0:04:19.039,0:04:23.449
assigned to each of the dives it depends

0:04:21.079,0:04:25.550
on how difficult the dive is to how high

0:04:23.449,0:04:26.210
the degree of difficulty is and in this

0:04:25.550,0:04:28.460
competition

0:04:26.210,0:04:31.490
we're see ranging from two point seven

0:04:28.460,0:04:33.320
up to a highest of three point three now

0:04:31.490,0:04:35.600
I can explain that as it goes on but

0:04:33.320,0:04:37.400
what you're looking at seven execution

0:04:35.600,0:04:39.860
judges the two highest and two lowest

0:04:37.400,0:04:42.139
marks are discounted so they have lines

0:04:39.860,0:04:44.510
through them this is so we average out

0:04:42.139,0:04:47.060
any well any amount of subjectivity to

0:04:44.510,0:04:49.190
leave three marks those are then as Bob

0:04:47.060,0:04:51.260
said total to multiply by the degree of

0:04:49.190,0:04:53.330
difficulty to give the total for that

0:04:51.260,0:04:56.030
particular tie there girls this morning

0:04:53.330,0:04:58.550
have to do five different dives in five

0:04:56.030,0:05:00.470
different directions then they have six

0:04:58.550,0:05:01.039
you know directions to choose from if

0:05:00.470,0:05:02.950
you will

0:05:01.039,0:05:05.510
forwards which is self-explanatory

0:05:02.950,0:05:06.710
backwards which is also sup it's by

0:05:05.510,0:05:08.510
inwards which is where you stand

0:05:06.710,0:05:10.639
backwards spin forwards towards the

0:05:08.510,0:05:11.840
diving board the reverse which is the

0:05:10.639,0:05:14.180
opposite which is where you stand

0:05:11.840,0:05:16.220
forwards jump away from the diving board

0:05:14.180,0:05:18.490
and spin backwards towards it and the

0:05:16.220,0:05:20.660
twist group which is where you rotate

0:05:18.490,0:05:22.550
longitudinally as well that's really

0:05:20.660,0:05:23.960
complicated and of course the sixth

0:05:22.550,0:05:26.930
group which is available on the platform

0:05:23.960,0:05:28.940
is the handstand the arm stand group and

0:05:26.930,0:05:31.250
some girls choose to do that and my co

0:05:28.940,0:05:33.440
commentator Paul baloff gets ever so

0:05:31.250,0:05:36.270
nervous when the girls or the boys do

0:05:33.440,0:05:38.099
handstands from the 10-meter platform

0:05:36.270,0:05:40.440
now they made it easy for you this

0:05:38.099,0:05:42.900
morning in as to much as the first 10

0:05:40.440,0:05:44.849
divers will all do exactly the same dive

0:05:42.900,0:05:47.849
to get a chance to compare and contrast

0:05:44.849,0:05:52.500
how good or bad or indifferent the dives

0:05:47.849,0:05:55.289
up so first 10 or opting for a 4 3 and

0:05:52.500,0:05:57.509
1/2 somersaults in the pike position as

0:05:55.289,0:05:59.340
you see on your screen 3.0 degree of

0:05:57.509,0:06:01.949
difficulty so the marks account will be

0:05:59.340,0:06:05.280
multiplied by that for all of the first

0:06:01.949,0:06:09.840
10 divers first up is Kim of the

0:06:05.280,0:06:12.030
People's Republic of Korea or she was

0:06:09.840,0:06:15.120
probably one of the surprise is making

0:06:12.030,0:06:18.270
it through just scraping in in 18th spot

0:06:15.120,0:06:19.530
that's a very steady opening dive what

0:06:18.270,0:06:21.270
you're looking for right on the end of

0:06:19.530,0:06:22.560
the diving board you notice a towel on

0:06:21.270,0:06:25.139
the end of the diving port there that's

0:06:22.560,0:06:27.509
just preference for the for the divers

0:06:25.139,0:06:29.490
it is actually a non-slip surface on the

0:06:27.509,0:06:31.409
e on the platform but some divers

0:06:29.490,0:06:33.720
preferring probably from a comfort point

0:06:31.409,0:06:35.639
of view to put a wet towel down to add

0:06:33.720,0:06:36.479
to some grip but that's a solid start

0:06:35.639,0:06:38.669
from Kim

0:06:36.479,0:06:40.229
yeah 63 is a mark you will probably see

0:06:38.669,0:06:43.770
quite a bit off because the judges tend

0:06:40.229,0:06:46.110
to go for that mid range 7 x the degree

0:06:43.770,0:06:48.300
of difficulty of use 63 there are a few

0:06:46.110,0:06:50.940
divers were waiting to up their game

0:06:48.300,0:06:53.070
considerably and here is one of them the

0:06:50.940,0:06:57.150
first of the Canadians you'll see Ross

0:06:53.070,0:06:59.400
Lee in Philly on second up of 18

0:06:57.150,0:07:02.219
remember we reduce them to 12 for the

0:06:59.400,0:07:04.520
final later today again the four three

0:07:02.219,0:07:04.520
and a half

0:07:05.810,0:07:10.110
she's had liquid off her game she

0:07:08.340,0:07:12.060
certainly was last night this young lady

0:07:10.110,0:07:15.389
wanted ones medal and he last week in

0:07:12.060,0:07:18.449
the synchronized 10 meter event with

0:07:15.389,0:07:20.460
their partners also in this contest well

0:07:18.449,0:07:21.750
it could be doing squeezing into a bike

0:07:20.460,0:07:23.190
shape a little bit more there who didn't

0:07:21.750,0:07:25.500
look very neat and tidy she's a little

0:07:23.190,0:07:28.610
bit loose as she entered the water looks

0:07:25.500,0:07:31.050
a little bit tired actually there we go

0:07:28.610,0:07:32.699
see the divers punching a hole into the

0:07:31.050,0:07:34.860
water they're spreading their hands as

0:07:32.699,0:07:37.919
they go in and sucking down all the air

0:07:34.860,0:07:40.020
with them to try and do the rip entry

0:07:37.919,0:07:43.949
which is a splash this entry not as good

0:07:40.020,0:07:45.530
as the opening dive 61.5 0 for filly on

0:07:43.949,0:07:55.409
now he comes

0:07:45.530,0:07:57.780
Maria Carillo Maria not quite completing

0:07:55.409,0:08:00.300
the dive you can see entering shorter

0:07:57.780,0:08:02.639
vertical as she hits the water I think

0:08:00.300,0:08:05.129
she needed an 11 meter platform to make

0:08:02.639,0:08:07.020
this one safely this of course only a 10

0:08:05.129,0:08:08.879
metre platform look how low she finishes

0:08:07.020,0:08:10.440
to the water the water would hit her on

0:08:08.879,0:08:11.969
a chest and then the top of her thighs

0:08:10.440,0:08:14.130
throwing up quite a lot of splash

0:08:11.969,0:08:17.370
there'll be the lowest scoring dive so

0:08:14.130,0:08:18.960
far early stages but for this young

0:08:17.370,0:08:20.130
German diver to make it through she

0:08:18.960,0:08:22.860
would need to be at the top of her game

0:08:20.130,0:08:24.210
and that's a little bit off quite a bit

0:08:22.860,0:08:26.819
off unfortunately from her point of view

0:08:24.210,0:08:29.669
so already having to play catch-up 49.5

0:08:26.819,0:08:33.060
0 with 4 and a half's and 5 sprinkled

0:08:29.669,0:08:38.760
across there and she is way off the pace

0:08:33.060,0:08:40.709
early stages now Kim Jin Ock of he was

0:08:38.760,0:08:42.750
probably good career semi-finalists in

0:08:40.709,0:08:44.279
Beijing and also the last two World

0:08:42.750,0:08:47.010
Championships oh she's emulating what

0:08:44.279,0:08:52.649
she's done in her last three big meets

0:08:47.010,0:08:54.560
and she oh one better this time it's

0:08:52.649,0:08:57.230
very good

0:08:54.560,0:08:58.819
the drivers are looking to enter the

0:08:57.230,0:09:00.439
water fantastic support from the

0:08:58.819,0:09:02.569
teammates look at the enter the water

0:09:00.439,0:09:03.649
completely vertically with no splash and

0:09:02.569,0:09:05.480
if you're doing that you're going to get

0:09:03.649,0:09:07.490
eight and upwards from the judges I

0:09:05.480,0:09:09.790
think that's the best forward three and

0:09:07.490,0:09:11.899
a half we've seen this morning from Kim

0:09:09.790,0:09:14.449
squeezing into the pipe shape heavily

0:09:11.899,0:09:16.279
taped on ankles and and calf's there

0:09:14.449,0:09:18.019
lots of these divers held together by

0:09:16.279,0:09:20.269
sticky tape and this is one of them

0:09:18.019,0:09:22.579
that's good very good

0:09:20.269,0:09:25.339
70 point five zero couple of eights and

0:09:22.579,0:09:27.410
a 7.5 to count towards the total times

0:09:25.339,0:09:30.649
three and you get the picture and you

0:09:27.410,0:09:33.519
get the calculation brittany viola it

0:09:30.649,0:09:37.059
has a big support team including her dad

0:09:33.519,0:09:42.559
it was a major league baseball legend

0:09:37.059,0:09:44.629
Frank the Americans going with a for

0:09:42.559,0:09:51.439
three and a half as indeed all the

0:09:44.629,0:09:53.689
previous four have done run over

0:09:51.439,0:09:56.509
Brittany really attacking the take off

0:09:53.689,0:09:58.249
they're cranking up the rotation which

0:09:56.509,0:10:00.589
is well exactly what you want to be

0:09:58.249,0:10:02.389
doing have a little bit of a nap there I

0:10:00.589,0:10:03.620
think it might be a bit tired from a

0:10:02.389,0:10:06.199
late finish last night

0:10:03.620,0:10:08.750
here we go squeezing into the pike shape

0:10:06.199,0:10:10.790
all looks good so far just a little bit

0:10:08.750,0:10:11.720
late from the rotation and rolls over a

0:10:10.790,0:10:14.180
touch

0:10:11.720,0:10:15.889
Stood Still get over 65 points which

0:10:14.180,0:10:17.240
will keep her in contention I'm

0:10:15.889,0:10:18.829
surprised to see her this load I'm

0:10:17.240,0:10:21.050
finished she did make one mistake though

0:10:18.829,0:10:24.170
last night to move it down the pack yeah

0:10:21.050,0:10:26.870
it was better to move up as well 60 7.50

0:10:24.170,0:10:28.339
it's a solid opening died for her that

0:10:26.870,0:10:30.350
put her in second place for the time

0:10:28.339,0:10:34.610
being now the big surprise to me last

0:10:30.350,0:10:36.500
night was this lady hello Espinoza

0:10:34.610,0:10:38.540
Sanchez bronze medalist now she never

0:10:36.500,0:10:42.620
really got going in a program perhaps

0:10:38.540,0:10:45.679
you will on this occasion yep it's still

0:10:42.620,0:10:48.199
not as good as we would expect from Paul

0:10:45.679,0:10:50.120
Espinoza multiple medallist at world

0:10:48.199,0:10:51.980
level and of course Olympic medalist

0:10:50.120,0:10:55.579
only last week in the synchronized

0:10:51.980,0:10:56.959
10-meter platform here just arching as

0:10:55.579,0:10:59.059
she goes into the water giving the

0:10:56.959,0:11:00.980
impression the dive is further over than

0:10:59.059,0:11:03.019
it actually was so over from vertical

0:11:00.980,0:11:04.910
splash comes towards us there she'll

0:11:03.019,0:11:06.510
only get sevens on that better than a

0:11:04.910,0:11:08.970
prelim but still not just good

0:11:06.510,0:11:10.920
we expect her wing for her to come to

0:11:08.970,0:11:12.600
life and show what she really is all

0:11:10.920,0:11:13.980
about because she was so impressive last

0:11:12.600,0:11:15.660
year at the world's but so far we

0:11:13.980,0:11:19.110
haven't seen anything like that kind of

0:11:15.660,0:11:22.100
form from her now the Hungarian born

0:11:19.110,0:11:28.290
Italian representing their we bat key

0:11:22.100,0:11:30.900
again same time again maybe just letting

0:11:28.290,0:11:33.210
the tide run over a vertical you can see

0:11:30.900,0:11:34.620
the sprays there from the side of the

0:11:33.210,0:11:37.170
pool it's actually like a hose pipe

0:11:34.620,0:11:39.450
spraying water just onto the surface the

0:11:37.170,0:11:41.520
reason for this is so you disturb the

0:11:39.450,0:11:44.130
surface of the water so the divers can

0:11:41.520,0:11:45.870
see exactly where they want to land so

0:11:44.130,0:11:47.640
if the water was still you could see the

0:11:45.870,0:11:49.680
bottom of the pool which is actually

0:11:47.640,0:11:52.020
five point eight meters further away so

0:11:49.680,0:11:53.760
those sprays disturbing the water so the

0:11:52.020,0:11:56.970
divers know exactly when to grab their

0:11:53.760,0:11:58.290
hands and try and enter the water she

0:11:56.970,0:12:00.780
might be a bit disturbed by that school

0:11:58.290,0:12:01.710
and actually 58.50 not quite what she

0:12:00.780,0:12:04.110
would have hoped for

0:12:01.710,0:12:07.410
remember it's five rounds and plenty of

0:12:04.110,0:12:11.160
time for reparation he only up for a

0:12:07.410,0:12:12.810
Gottschalk of Ukraine right down to dive

0:12:11.160,0:12:16.440
at number eleven we'll see exactly the

0:12:12.810,0:12:20.340
same shoes diver number six there's that

0:12:16.440,0:12:21.210
for three and a half again well that's

0:12:20.340,0:12:24.900
very tidy

0:12:21.210,0:12:26.130
she needs to squeeze into a pike shape a

0:12:24.900,0:12:28.350
little bit to get most marks from the

0:12:26.130,0:12:29.940
judges there should be no daylight in

0:12:28.350,0:12:32.070
between the thighs and the chest and as

0:12:29.940,0:12:33.990
you can see that you can almost drive a

0:12:32.070,0:12:35.700
small car through that gap it needs to

0:12:33.990,0:12:39.560
be a lot tighter but she does a very

0:12:35.700,0:12:42.090
good entry on the end of the dive there

0:12:39.560,0:12:44.250
yes yeah it's an interesting technique

0:12:42.090,0:12:46.170
normally the divers wrap around the

0:12:44.250,0:12:47.010
backs of the the calf's with the

0:12:46.170,0:12:49.320
forearms

0:12:47.010,0:12:50.490
Yuliya they're holding on with the hands

0:12:49.320,0:12:52.080
that's very difficult you need the

0:12:50.490,0:12:54.540
incredible amount of arm strength but

0:12:52.080,0:12:56.130
she gets eighths on it she does 72 puts

0:12:54.540,0:12:58.530
her in the lead a reminder to you the

0:12:56.130,0:13:01.320
judge is to not see the replays that you

0:12:58.530,0:13:04.170
see they judge it purely and what they

0:13:01.320,0:13:06.390
see in real-time so if we see anything

0:13:04.170,0:13:07.770
on the replays that they don't well

0:13:06.390,0:13:10.980
because they only get one look and we

0:13:07.770,0:13:14.270
get several making Ben feet Oh second of

0:13:10.980,0:13:16.350
the Canadians with our opening dive

0:13:14.270,0:13:19.069
there you can see the difference in the

0:13:16.350,0:13:22.050
pike shape there between Megan and luleå

0:13:19.069,0:13:25.230
squeezing in so there was no daylight in

0:13:22.050,0:13:27.000
between her body and her thighs look at

0:13:25.230,0:13:29.699
this squeezing into that tight Pike

0:13:27.000,0:13:31.380
shape completing the rotations very

0:13:29.699,0:13:33.480
comfortably just letting the dive roll

0:13:31.380,0:13:35.190
over she goes in so she won't get any

0:13:33.480,0:13:39.720
eight seven and a half's I think on this

0:13:35.190,0:13:42.779
one and I expect this lady to feature in

0:13:39.720,0:13:44.880
this evening's final ya be a big

0:13:42.779,0:13:47.190
surprise if she didn't a lot of

0:13:44.880,0:13:49.139
Canadians here to support her both at

0:13:47.190,0:13:54.389
the port and what he on TV I know in the

0:13:49.139,0:13:58.259
UK so 7.5 s gross the board times three

0:13:54.389,0:14:01.529
gives you 60 7.50 now Katie's gonna have

0:13:58.259,0:14:07.380
a chat here we go preparation as a smile

0:14:01.529,0:14:09.920
has a chat she'll count herself in and

0:14:07.380,0:14:09.920
ready to go

0:14:11.490,0:14:16.360
well it seems to work though she's got

0:14:13.990,0:14:19.180
more moves than the chess player out

0:14:16.360,0:14:20.740
there moving around quite nervous

0:14:19.180,0:14:22.870
talking to herself doing what she needs

0:14:20.740,0:14:25.240
to do but it certainly worked for

0:14:22.870,0:14:27.430
yesterday in the prelims and that's the

0:14:25.240,0:14:29.440
better start here just a little bit over

0:14:27.430,0:14:30.880
vertigo but a splash this entry

0:14:29.440,0:14:32.920
this could get some eights from the

0:14:30.880,0:14:35.190
judges and probably put a top of the

0:14:32.920,0:14:39.160
leaderboard so far in this competition

0:14:35.190,0:14:40.630
great start there from Katie Bell think

0:14:39.160,0:14:43.839
we've warmed to it certainly the crowd

0:14:40.630,0:14:46.510
have just idea synchronous before she

0:14:43.839,0:14:52.839
dives seventy-three point five zero puts

0:14:46.510,0:14:55.060
Katie Bell into the lead now my Nakagawa

0:14:52.839,0:14:57.519
of japan she had a very good freelancer

0:14:55.060,0:14:58.690
with a very small degree of difficulty

0:14:57.519,0:15:01.029
in comparison

0:14:58.690,0:15:02.740
oh now did you hear that so what

0:15:01.029,0:15:04.690
happened there she's doing the inward

0:15:02.740,0:15:07.990
and she actually smacks her feet on the

0:15:04.690,0:15:10.000
board I heard a sound now if the judges

0:15:07.990,0:15:13.149
saw that as well you'll see on the

0:15:10.000,0:15:14.769
replay here dong Oh with the toes that

0:15:13.149,0:15:16.329
isn't gonna hurt but it does why it

0:15:14.769,0:15:17.620
doesn't throw her because it dies very

0:15:16.329,0:15:19.870
good now if the judges see it they're

0:15:17.620,0:15:21.490
gonna cane her on the points so they're

0:15:19.870,0:15:22.750
gonna really penalize because of course

0:15:21.490,0:15:25.420
you're not going to hit the diving board

0:15:22.750,0:15:27.610
and because it made a loud donk sound I

0:15:25.420,0:15:29.170
think the judges will all spot that well

0:15:27.610,0:15:30.399
they should their Olympic judges let's

0:15:29.170,0:15:31.959
see well yes they do

0:15:30.399,0:15:33.190
no they do they've all spotted it that

0:15:31.959,0:15:34.930
would have got eights if it didn't so

0:15:33.190,0:15:37.420
they've decided to take off the right

0:15:34.930,0:15:38.860
amount of points all right four point

0:15:37.420,0:15:40.750
five two six point five thing is quite a

0:15:38.860,0:15:42.250
differential but obviously that's the

0:15:40.750,0:15:45.160
reason we have it even now in the middle

0:15:42.250,0:15:48.040
so we don't get too much of a wide

0:15:45.160,0:15:50.699
spread of mark so we've seen threes see

0:15:48.040,0:15:53.829
in 2.7 our upping the ante a little bit

0:15:50.699,0:15:57.040
this will be a three point one and the

0:15:53.829,0:16:00.089
first time our arm stands winning our I

0:15:57.040,0:16:02.889
can hear in the background for the crowd

0:16:00.089,0:16:04.720
yes so impressive isn't it could you

0:16:02.889,0:16:08.440
imagine just standing on the edge of a

0:16:04.720,0:16:09.699
10 metre platform anyway but let alone

0:16:08.440,0:16:12.220
doing a handstand

0:16:09.699,0:16:14.740
it seems pretty normal to me I used to

0:16:12.220,0:16:17.350
do it every day but here we go for those

0:16:14.740,0:16:19.569
of you at home look how impressive this

0:16:17.350,0:16:21.160
is and that's a beautiful dive here

0:16:19.569,0:16:23.290
that'll put her straight into the lead

0:16:21.160,0:16:25.840
she did this in the prelims yesterday

0:16:23.290,0:16:27.940
opening up on probably her best dive and

0:16:25.840,0:16:31.330
what confidence does it take to open up

0:16:27.940,0:16:33.160
your Olympic competition in a handstand

0:16:31.330,0:16:34.540
well she throws up a bit like a catapult

0:16:33.160,0:16:37.660
there and it worked very effectively

0:16:34.540,0:16:39.100
eight point five and eight Alice is

0:16:37.660,0:16:40.720
slightly higher degree of difficulty

0:16:39.100,0:16:42.730
gives her the extra marks to seventy

0:16:40.720,0:16:45.340
seven point five zero first of the two

0:16:42.730,0:16:49.780
Chinese now who you Dan sixteen years of

0:16:45.340,0:16:52.660
age I'd see this more like eight who you

0:16:49.780,0:16:55.540
Dan was a little bit off by her

0:16:52.660,0:16:57.730
standards last night and watching her in

0:16:55.540,0:16:59.170
training she doesn't seem to be as sharp

0:16:57.730,0:17:02.020
as I've seen her before

0:16:59.170,0:17:04.510
she is only 16 but she is an absolutely

0:17:02.020,0:17:05.890
phenomenal diver and that is just a

0:17:04.510,0:17:08.170
little bit off the pace he'll only get

0:17:05.890,0:17:10.120
seven and a half now from this young

0:17:08.170,0:17:12.160
lady I've seen her disappear into the

0:17:10.120,0:17:14.860
water four nines and tens on this dive

0:17:12.160,0:17:17.410
and that is back from the eight ball

0:17:14.860,0:17:20.199
right across the board seven point five

0:17:17.410,0:17:24.300
up to 8.5 we'll count to a total which

0:17:20.199,0:17:27.459
is 69 for who goes into fifth place in

0:17:24.300,0:17:29.560
round one now from Australia didn't do

0:17:27.459,0:17:32.620
the synchro ten last week as we thought

0:17:29.560,0:17:34.450
she might the second place in their

0:17:32.620,0:17:38.590
transfer here she is individual Melissa

0:17:34.450,0:17:40.810
whoo yeah very steady from Melissa woo

0:17:38.590,0:17:42.970
last night in the prelims one of the few

0:17:40.810,0:17:44.710
drivers who were diving consistently and

0:17:42.970,0:17:46.570
I'm sure she'll put in a consistent

0:17:44.710,0:17:47.950
performance here in the semi-final again

0:17:46.570,0:17:50.950
opting for the towel that's just a

0:17:47.950,0:17:52.780
comfort thing it is wet to give you a

0:17:50.950,0:17:56.350
little bit more grip or maybe not

0:17:52.780,0:17:57.850
anyway it's the divers preference needs

0:17:56.350,0:17:59.740
to be in with the color and the branding

0:17:57.850,0:18:01.750
so the towels are provided because some

0:17:59.740,0:18:05.050
divers like to use them and Melissa rue

0:18:01.750,0:18:07.150
is one and she ends up pretty good after

0:18:05.050,0:18:08.980
a first round dive yeah it goes into

0:18:07.150,0:18:11.500
joint second place seventy-three point

0:18:08.980,0:18:13.840
five zero so a nice solid opening from

0:18:11.500,0:18:16.840
the Australian four points behind the

0:18:13.840,0:18:19.090
Russian Colton over now Brittany Broman

0:18:16.840,0:18:21.190
second of the Australians 16 years of

0:18:19.090,0:18:22.990
age with her reverse two-and-a-half

0:18:21.190,0:18:24.370
somersaults with tuck slight variance

0:18:22.990,0:18:27.070
for you and only two point seven

0:18:24.370,0:18:29.140
attached to this one well what a dive I

0:18:27.070,0:18:31.360
was expecting that this is her favorite

0:18:29.140,0:18:33.820
dive she tends to open with it and it's

0:18:31.360,0:18:35.410
an impressive one so this is the reverse

0:18:33.820,0:18:37.480
this is where you stand forwards and

0:18:35.410,0:18:40.660
jump away from the diving board spinning

0:18:37.480,0:18:42.760
backwards dangerous impressive and that

0:18:40.660,0:18:46.240
is very well executed this could see

0:18:42.760,0:18:48.880
some nines and it certainly should only

0:18:46.240,0:18:51.040
16 years old and Wow she is performing

0:18:48.880,0:18:53.140
exceptionally well in her first Olympic

0:18:51.040,0:18:54.790
Games I had a very safe distance from

0:18:53.140,0:18:56.650
the board as well she's good see yes he

0:18:54.790,0:18:59.140
was not a few people getting much more

0:18:56.650,0:19:01.480
close than we would like but she has

0:18:59.140,0:19:03.250
achieved what she needed to do with that

0:19:01.480,0:19:07.000
opening dive it's very impressive 70

0:19:03.250,0:19:09.010
1.55 puts her in with the top pack in

0:19:07.000,0:19:11.860
fifth place now this I think was a

0:19:09.010,0:19:14.140
surprise this is a low tariff program

0:19:11.860,0:19:16.510
that Cristiano has but she did it to

0:19:14.140,0:19:18.220
perfection last night pretty much 2.8

0:19:16.510,0:19:20.530
inward two-and-a-half somersaults she'll

0:19:18.220,0:19:22.890
perform this in the pike position which

0:19:20.530,0:19:25.300
Leon will explain after you've seen it

0:19:22.890,0:19:27.640
yeah if you remember in the prelim this

0:19:25.300,0:19:29.710
was her weakest dive she actually laid

0:19:27.640,0:19:31.870
left herself quite a lot to do and then

0:19:29.710,0:19:34.090
you know cruise through as other girls

0:19:31.870,0:19:35.770
were faltering moving away from the

0:19:34.090,0:19:37.750
diving board missing her feet

0:19:35.770,0:19:39.730
unlike Nakagawa who tipped her toes

0:19:37.750,0:19:41.200
christine storm moving and safe for

0:19:39.730,0:19:43.120
distance away from the diving board it

0:19:41.200,0:19:44.800
is tricky to miss the diving board

0:19:43.120,0:19:46.330
because you're obviously in the pike

0:19:44.800,0:19:47.770
position which is folding at the hips

0:19:46.330,0:19:49.840
and keeping it straight through the

0:19:47.770,0:19:51.640
knees there we go so those marks are

0:19:49.840,0:19:53.440
okay but less than 60 points she'll be

0:19:51.640,0:19:56.140
off the pace yeah the degree of

0:19:53.440,0:19:58.210
difficulty reducing her options in terms

0:19:56.140,0:20:01.570
of points she can achieve and that's

0:19:58.210,0:20:08.710
gonna put her down relatively near the

0:20:01.570,0:20:10.110
bottom and panga 310 and syncro very

0:20:08.710,0:20:14.020
busy girl

0:20:10.110,0:20:15.960
she was on fire yesterday wasn't she in

0:20:14.020,0:20:18.460
the preliminaries there are teammates

0:20:15.960,0:20:23.050
cheering her on fantastic support for

0:20:18.460,0:20:24.850
all of the divers here today and look at

0:20:23.050,0:20:26.380
this Pike shape it's beautiful she seems

0:20:24.850,0:20:28.030
to have such amazing flexibility in the

0:20:26.380,0:20:30.010
hamstrings and in the lower back that

0:20:28.030,0:20:32.500
she could almost get her chin on her

0:20:30.010,0:20:34.540
ankles in the pike shape which is very

0:20:32.500,0:20:36.700
impressive it makes the rotations even

0:20:34.540,0:20:38.860
easier she could do is squeezing into a

0:20:36.700,0:20:40.420
pike shape a little bit more but I think

0:20:38.860,0:20:42.730
she's rotating that fast she was a

0:20:40.420,0:20:43.720
little bit nervous to squeeze in too

0:20:42.730,0:20:46.299
much

0:20:43.720,0:20:49.659
she starts with a good score once again

0:20:46.299,0:20:51.760
six 7.50 remember these diamonds have

0:20:49.659,0:20:55.169
had a very short recovery time they're

0:20:51.760,0:20:57.820
still competing about 12 hours ago

0:20:55.169,0:21:00.130
outstanding diver in the preliminaries

0:20:57.820,0:21:01.240
I'm gonna get by a long way Chen ruling

0:21:00.130,0:21:05.230
of China

0:21:01.240,0:21:07.450
well champion bull maybe Chen didn't

0:21:05.230,0:21:08.740
quite get to bed early enough last night

0:21:07.450,0:21:10.150
well she didn't have a choice because

0:21:08.740,0:21:12.070
she was still in here until 10:00 p.m.

0:21:10.150,0:21:12.610
that's a little bit off for this young

0:21:12.070,0:21:15.429
lady

0:21:12.610,0:21:17.650
Olympic champion at the age of 15 here

0:21:15.429,0:21:20.919
she is four years on and hasn't really

0:21:17.650,0:21:22.510
been challenged in this event since the

0:21:20.919,0:21:24.010
occasional competition that there's been

0:21:22.510,0:21:25.840
a bit more closely run but that's a

0:21:24.010,0:21:27.370
little bit off the off the mark there

0:21:25.840,0:21:28.600
for Emily and that's gonna put her while

0:21:27.370,0:21:32.140
she's not going to be top after the

0:21:28.600,0:21:34.809
first round which is unusual although we

0:21:32.140,0:21:37.000
must build a little caveat to that the

0:21:34.809,0:21:38.830
Chinese sometimes get a little bit

0:21:37.000,0:21:43.690
marked up now she has been on this

0:21:38.830,0:21:46.900
occasion 88.5 seventy-three point five

0:21:43.690,0:21:51.909
zero for the olympic gold medalists from

0:21:46.900,0:21:55.179
last time around age of 15 now 19 so

0:21:51.909,0:21:58.030
round one is completed these are the

0:21:55.179,0:22:00.520
scores remember top 12 go through bottom

0:21:58.030,0:22:02.049
six get discarded all turnover very

0:22:00.520,0:22:04.419
positive start for her Katie Bell

0:22:02.049,0:22:06.070
general in and Melissa Wu all together

0:22:04.419,0:22:08.770
so at the moment it's the competition

0:22:06.070,0:22:10.270
where to stop our Espinoza Sanchez

0:22:08.770,0:22:11.740
who'll be the last one to go through and

0:22:10.270,0:22:15.880
we would lose Rosalie and Feeny off

0:22:11.740,0:22:18.460
among others below that line of 12 26

0:22:15.880,0:22:20.380
down to 18 and then bounced 12 tonight

0:22:18.460,0:22:21.909
so just to explain the differences in

0:22:20.380,0:22:25.750
some of the dives that we're seeing so

0:22:21.909,0:22:27.610
the girls have to do five dives and five

0:22:25.750,0:22:29.260
different dives they have to cover five

0:22:27.610,0:22:31.059
different groups so basically they go in

0:22:29.260,0:22:32.620
different directions and you've seen

0:22:31.059,0:22:35.049
most of them now forwards backwards

0:22:32.620,0:22:36.730
inwards so he stands backward spin

0:22:35.049,0:22:38.980
forward to reverse which is raced and

0:22:36.730,0:22:40.720
forwards and spin backwards and also the

0:22:38.980,0:22:42.370
quest which is where you rotate them on

0:22:40.720,0:22:46.120
the longitudinal axis as well this is

0:22:42.370,0:22:47.740
the inwards coming up now for Kim inward

0:22:46.120,0:22:50.080
three and a half summer sorts with tuck

0:22:47.740,0:22:51.669
and the degree of difficulty is the

0:22:50.080,0:22:54.890
highest we have seen in the competition

0:22:51.669,0:22:57.530
so far three point to remember top

0:22:54.890,0:23:05.660
Mark's three that count we multiply by

0:22:57.530,0:23:10.190
the degree of difficulty well she does

0:23:05.660,0:23:10.490
very well very well Kim there's a little

0:23:10.190,0:23:12.140
world

0:23:10.490,0:23:14.120
lots of the ladies were a bit here and

0:23:12.140,0:23:16.550
there in the prelim that Kim made it

0:23:14.120,0:23:18.350
through squeezing in her hair it's quite

0:23:16.550,0:23:19.880
close to the diving board in fact it may

0:23:18.350,0:23:21.980
have even have touched the diving board

0:23:19.880,0:23:23.840
so that's a little bit too close for

0:23:21.980,0:23:25.520
comfort this is the dive that Monique

0:23:23.840,0:23:27.980
cladding had an accident on and you can

0:23:25.520,0:23:29.510
see how accidents can happen they just

0:23:27.980,0:23:31.250
stand back would spin forwards towards

0:23:29.510,0:23:34.060
it the judges didn't think it was too

0:23:31.250,0:23:37.970
close though they've marked her fairly

0:23:34.060,0:23:40.550
close enough for me to close seven and

0:23:37.970,0:23:42.920
six 7.20 remember the middle marks the

0:23:40.550,0:23:45.410
ones account top to bottom two discarded

0:23:42.920,0:23:46.640
the middle ones will count and the

0:23:45.410,0:23:48.230
degree of difficulty is the

0:23:46.640,0:23:51.860
multiplication that's how we arrived at

0:23:48.230,0:23:53.720
sixty seven point two zero now 14th

0:23:51.860,0:23:56.120
place after round one someone be there

0:23:53.720,0:23:58.010
for very long Rosaline filly on and a

0:23:56.120,0:24:02.300
back three-and-a-half he's a bigger dive

0:23:58.010,0:24:03.830
indeed three point three she she

0:24:02.300,0:24:06.260
struggled on that in the prelims and she

0:24:03.830,0:24:07.790
struggled a little bit again to tell for

0:24:06.260,0:24:10.190
my first dive that she looked a little

0:24:07.790,0:24:11.990
bit maybe fatigued a little bit tired

0:24:10.190,0:24:13.520
which I'm not surprised about anyway

0:24:11.990,0:24:15.520
this is a big dive she needs to squeeze

0:24:13.520,0:24:17.780
into a tuck shape a little bit more

0:24:15.520,0:24:19.490
ending up shorter vertical with their

0:24:17.780,0:24:21.320
lower back arch and throwing out quite a

0:24:19.490,0:24:24.980
bit of splash it should get over 60

0:24:21.320,0:24:26.720
points it was better than the prelims so

0:24:24.980,0:24:28.220
all it's not over for this young lady

0:24:26.720,0:24:29.990
but you can just see by her body

0:24:28.220,0:24:31.880
language there that she was finding it

0:24:29.990,0:24:34.340
tough out there today frustrating for

0:24:31.880,0:24:36.260
her just over the 61.5 she's gone down

0:24:34.340,0:24:38.060
to sixty 1.05 that was a higher degree

0:24:36.260,0:24:40.280
of difficulty on that dive as well it's

0:24:38.060,0:24:41.630
Maria Carrillo with our armed stance

0:24:40.280,0:24:43.610
which give me a chance to tell you that

0:24:41.630,0:24:45.410
she struck a head against the 10 meter

0:24:43.610,0:24:47.210
tower lost consciousness and fell into

0:24:45.410,0:24:50.050
the water just over two years ago

0:24:47.210,0:24:53.300
suffering lacerations and concussion

0:24:50.050,0:24:56.330
that kind of story to money cladding

0:24:53.300,0:24:56.750
last year she was back on the diving

0:24:56.330,0:24:58.730
board

0:24:56.750,0:25:01.550
a month later can you believe how brave

0:24:58.730,0:25:05.270
some of these divers are they come to

0:25:01.550,0:25:06.650
our arm stands a big one 23.2 i'm stand

0:25:05.270,0:25:08.240
back double somersault

0:25:06.650,0:25:08.640
one and a half twist we will see one

0:25:08.240,0:25:13.440
more

0:25:08.640,0:25:17.190
intricate than this later on yeah booze

0:25:13.440,0:25:19.980
and ours from the crowd and very very

0:25:17.190,0:25:23.340
impressive having to show a steady arm

0:25:19.980,0:25:25.110
stand balanced before to the judges

0:25:23.340,0:25:27.510
before you take off flicking off there

0:25:25.110,0:25:29.550
into the one and a half twist completing

0:25:27.510,0:25:31.290
the dive she's straight up and down on

0:25:29.550,0:25:31.950
that that'll get over 70 points seven

0:25:31.290,0:25:34.110
and a half

0:25:31.950,0:25:35.130
there we go lifting up interesting one

0:25:34.110,0:25:37.440
foot at a time

0:25:35.130,0:25:39.150
elbows have been that's incredible arm

0:25:37.440,0:25:40.710
strength here she goes look at that

0:25:39.150,0:25:43.380
overhead view any of you fancied that Oh

0:25:40.710,0:25:46.260
home mm-hmm probably not no thank you

0:25:43.380,0:25:50.090
for asking but I'll decline that offer

0:25:46.260,0:25:53.400
very kind there it is 72 from Cuyo and

0:25:50.090,0:25:55.020
she and filly or have you the battle

0:25:53.400,0:26:03.840
themselves about a second place as it

0:25:55.020,0:26:06.780
stands on to Kim Jin oke all the

0:26:03.840,0:26:12.030
People's Republic of Korea well to make

0:26:06.780,0:26:13.350
it through first semi-final and she's

0:26:12.030,0:26:16.980
getting in with three and a half

0:26:13.350,0:26:18.300
somersaults 3.2 well she's done well

0:26:16.980,0:26:20.340
there it looked like there was a

0:26:18.300,0:26:22.050
trapdoor on the end of the 10 meter

0:26:20.340,0:26:24.330
diving board just as she took off

0:26:22.050,0:26:26.100
instead of springing up through the

0:26:24.330,0:26:28.110
ankle she seems to move her hips back

0:26:26.100,0:26:29.550
and skip backwards which does mean that

0:26:28.110,0:26:31.830
she's a safe distance from the diving

0:26:29.550,0:26:33.570
board which is good but it does make the

0:26:31.830,0:26:36.360
dive more difficult to control however

0:26:33.570,0:26:41.730
Kim here does a fantastic job with a

0:26:36.360,0:26:46.440
trapdoor takeoff well done and the exits

0:26:41.730,0:26:50.280
are here here and here 60 7.20 sevens

0:26:46.440,0:26:52.800
for Kim and that puts temporarily at

0:26:50.280,0:26:55.010
least into first place ahead of the

0:26:52.800,0:26:57.970
other Kim

0:27:03.760,0:27:08.320
bollocks of things arm stand back double

0:27:06.910,0:27:10.210
somersault from one and a half twist

0:27:08.320,0:27:12.720
three point two you've seen this one

0:27:10.210,0:27:15.280
before you seen it executed pretty well

0:27:12.720,0:27:18.420
it's nice and the crowd as they can into

0:27:15.280,0:27:18.420
that upright position

0:27:22.090,0:27:28.330
oh it's just a little bit short of

0:27:25.299,0:27:30.309
vertical as she goes in there Britney

0:27:28.330,0:27:32.080
did all the hard work I mean imagine how

0:27:30.309,0:27:33.700
challenging it is all the blood rushes

0:27:32.080,0:27:35.590
to your head then you need to flick off

0:27:33.700,0:27:38.289
and then you hurtle towards the water

0:27:35.590,0:27:38.799
hit in the water at nearly 40 miles an

0:27:38.289,0:27:41.980
hour

0:27:38.799,0:27:45.580
and he has a lot going on 1.6 seconds it

0:27:41.980,0:27:47.140
takes to complete the dive photo just a

0:27:45.580,0:27:49.029
little short she went into the water

0:27:47.140,0:27:50.770
there the water hitting her on the chest

0:27:49.029,0:27:52.360
and the front of the legs

0:27:50.770,0:27:53.890
splash going back towards the diving

0:27:52.360,0:27:56.140
board spreading the arms they're trying

0:27:53.890,0:27:57.100
to get in without any splash a little

0:27:56.140,0:27:59.620
bit under park

0:27:57.100,0:28:01.929
yeah chick flicks for you in the diving

0:27:59.620,0:28:04.029
this morning sixty point eight zero for

0:28:01.929,0:28:05.590
Brittany that's not gonna help her cause

0:28:04.029,0:28:08.470
a great deal she's slipping down the

0:28:05.590,0:28:10.659
pecking order and third at the moment

0:28:08.470,0:28:11.679
now come on power let's see what you can

0:28:10.659,0:28:14.470
really do helmet

0:28:11.679,0:28:16.380
Espinoza Sanchez of Mexico three point

0:28:14.470,0:28:19.299
three back three and a half somersaults

0:28:16.380,0:28:21.929
classy act and she show us and underline

0:28:19.299,0:28:21.929
why that's the case

0:28:21.970,0:28:25.269
now I think you should keep quiet when

0:28:23.740,0:28:26.799
powerless driving you doing this last

0:28:25.269,0:28:29.710
night in the prelims and this young lady

0:28:26.799,0:28:31.659
is an exceptional diver but we haven't

0:28:29.710,0:28:33.940
seen it since last week in the

0:28:31.659,0:28:36.250
synchronized diving event look how high

0:28:33.940,0:28:37.629
she is she cruises this dive kick sight

0:28:36.250,0:28:39.580
but she should be out of that dive

0:28:37.629,0:28:43.059
earlier over she goes

0:28:39.580,0:28:46.389
lots of splash enough splash Wow

0:28:43.059,0:28:48.340
mini wave mini surfboards time for some

0:28:46.389,0:28:51.100
surfing she ready she has given herself

0:28:48.340,0:28:52.929
a lot to do on the basis of that dive in

0:28:51.100,0:28:54.519
there and she slipped yeah like last

0:28:52.929,0:28:57.190
night she was 18 at one point looked

0:28:54.519,0:28:59.200
like she wouldn't make it only 12 today

0:28:57.190,0:29:01.330
not that comfort blanket of those six

0:28:59.200,0:29:04.179
places today she is in the bottom place

0:29:01.330,0:29:07.210
at the moment and struggling which I

0:29:04.179,0:29:09.519
find amazing they owe me back II of

0:29:07.210,0:29:11.200
Italy back two and a half summer sorta a

0:29:09.519,0:29:13.299
two point nine degree of difficulty on

0:29:11.200,0:29:21.070
this she'll perform it in the pike

0:29:13.299,0:29:22.720
position oh that's a bat around the back

0:29:21.070,0:29:24.309
of the head there she didn't look with

0:29:22.720,0:29:26.529
back with her chin and reach back with

0:29:24.309,0:29:27.970
the arms and let me tell you when the

0:29:26.529,0:29:30.700
water hits you that hard around the back

0:29:27.970,0:29:32.889
of the head that does not tickle oh my

0:29:30.700,0:29:35.139
goodness yeah this is why divers get so

0:29:32.889,0:29:37.000
many neck injuries all she goes in

0:29:35.139,0:29:39.039
interesting Paola showing you the

0:29:37.000,0:29:40.960
backward three and a half which caused a

0:29:39.039,0:29:42.879
carries a three point three degree of

0:29:40.960,0:29:44.740
difficulty this is backward two and a

0:29:42.879,0:29:46.809
half in the pike position easier only

0:29:44.740,0:29:49.179
two point nine so it needed to be better

0:29:46.809,0:29:51.879
than that from this young Italian well I

0:29:49.179,0:29:53.110
was telling you a little kind of wobble

0:29:51.879,0:29:55.690
here with a few of the divers this

0:29:53.110,0:29:59.320
happened last night where one seems to

0:29:55.690,0:30:00.970
trigger another triggers another need to

0:29:59.320,0:30:03.909
me just to steady the ship and get back

0:30:00.970,0:30:06.190
on target and back on track maybe it's

0:30:03.909,0:30:08.019
Elia for a cop truck the person who can

0:30:06.190,0:30:13.500
do that is that in with three and a half

0:30:08.019,0:30:13.500
three point to fifth after round one

0:30:15.450,0:30:19.440
well it's pretty good straight up and

0:30:17.550,0:30:21.120
down just a little bit too much splash

0:30:19.440,0:30:23.430
but it's three point two degree of

0:30:21.120,0:30:25.950
difficulty and as long as she's steady

0:30:23.430,0:30:28.080
she's got 72 on the first round I don't

0:30:25.950,0:30:29.490
think she'll be as high as that on

0:30:28.080,0:30:30.810
second mind I'm just throwing up a

0:30:29.490,0:30:33.900
little bit too much splash but she'll

0:30:30.810,0:30:36.680
get over 60s mid sixties probably and

0:30:33.900,0:30:38.880
that will be good enough to keep her

0:30:36.680,0:30:40.500
middle of the pack which is where she

0:30:38.880,0:30:42.630
needs to be to make it through to the

0:30:40.500,0:30:44.610
top 12 going through

0:30:42.630,0:30:47.400
yeah 64 not as good as our opening dive

0:30:44.610,0:30:50.460
which is 72 that was a high degree of

0:30:47.400,0:30:52.080
difficulty this time of course and she

0:30:50.460,0:30:53.370
goes for the time being at least into

0:30:52.080,0:30:57.770
second but she won't remain there for

0:30:53.370,0:31:02.340
too long no equal ninth after round 1

0:30:57.770,0:31:03.780
still not quite in the groove three

0:31:02.340,0:31:05.880
point three back three and a half

0:31:03.780,0:31:10.790
somersaults once more in the tuck

0:31:05.880,0:31:10.790
position for Canada's Megan Ben feet OH

0:31:12.830,0:31:18.030
or she does very well she made a little

0:31:16.530,0:31:20.210
bit of a mess of this in the prelims

0:31:18.030,0:31:23.280
that made it more difficult for her to

0:31:20.210,0:31:25.440
to finish in the top of the field and

0:31:23.280,0:31:27.480
she difficut fight back and this is much

0:31:25.440,0:31:28.860
more like it squeezing into the Tuck

0:31:27.480,0:31:30.510
shaped up shape bending at the hips and

0:31:28.860,0:31:32.310
at the knees hanging on to the shins

0:31:30.510,0:31:34.410
with both hands squeezing into it almost

0:31:32.310,0:31:36.000
a little ball you can only see where

0:31:34.410,0:31:38.340
you've been on this dive so you have to

0:31:36.000,0:31:40.410
predict where to place your feet where

0:31:38.340,0:31:42.270
she does perfectly and plunk sit right

0:31:40.410,0:31:44.250
on ahead seventy five point nine good

0:31:42.270,0:31:48.170
die yeah good I put her in the lead for

0:31:44.250,0:31:52.110
the time being now the pocket rocket

0:31:48.170,0:31:56.880
from Columbus USA twenty four years old

0:31:52.110,0:32:00.940
six stone eleven dripping wet with lots

0:31:56.880,0:32:05.740
of words to add talking to

0:32:00.940,0:32:07.000
I think she's talking to herself yes now

0:32:05.740,0:32:08.620
it was the counting in the basement is

0:32:07.000,0:32:13.500
it five six seven eight sometimes one

0:32:08.620,0:32:13.500
two three verse two and a half

0:32:19.820,0:32:25.260
or she's just well there's such a tricky

0:32:23.880,0:32:26.520
dive this is the reverse two-and-a-half

0:32:25.260,0:32:28.440
she's electing to do it in the pike

0:32:26.520,0:32:30.240
position which is two point nine degree

0:32:28.440,0:32:31.650
of difficulty she did it in the Tuck

0:32:30.240,0:32:34.170
position it would be only two point

0:32:31.650,0:32:37.200
seven so you get pretty close with your

0:32:34.170,0:32:39.030
toes and she was hanging on into a pike

0:32:37.200,0:32:40.650
shape too long there you can see the

0:32:39.030,0:32:41.820
dive goes over let's check out this

0:32:40.650,0:32:44.850
overhead camera shot

0:32:41.820,0:32:47.820
oh it's enough to make you well I'm not

0:32:44.850,0:32:50.580
sure but anyway she goes over too much

0:32:47.820,0:32:52.830
splash yeah 56 points she won't be happy

0:32:50.580,0:32:55.320
with that six point five across the

0:32:52.830,0:32:57.120
board fifty six point five five and that

0:32:55.320,0:33:00.300
just knocks her down a peg or two she

0:32:57.120,0:33:01.950
was second equal to round one waiting

0:33:00.300,0:33:05.000
for something really to come to life

0:33:01.950,0:33:08.130
maybe my neck Ogawa could be that person

0:33:05.000,0:33:10.770
no Nakagawa obviously lost over

0:33:08.130,0:33:13.230
confidence and whenever bob says watch

0:33:10.770,0:33:14.700
this dive up they seem to go oh hang on

0:33:13.230,0:33:16.980
a second that's too much pressure

0:33:14.700,0:33:18.900
anyway Nakagawa hitting her feet on the

0:33:16.980,0:33:21.840
first opening dive which put him into

0:33:18.900,0:33:24.330
18th here well what a shame all the

0:33:21.840,0:33:26.580
aerial work was fantastic spinning you

0:33:24.330,0:33:27.990
know as well it's all good what an

0:33:26.580,0:33:30.090
absolute change you should just come out

0:33:27.990,0:33:33.300
now but instead she comes out a little

0:33:30.090,0:33:35.400
bit later rolls over onto her back and I

0:33:33.300,0:33:38.160
think that'll be her campaign good is

0:33:35.400,0:33:40.080
over with too poor dives just incredible

0:33:38.160,0:33:42.600
how many divers in both the

0:33:40.080,0:33:45.930
preliminaries and this are not splitting

0:33:42.600,0:33:48.180
their entries forty-eight exactly for

0:33:45.930,0:33:51.030
the Japanese and you know we may not see

0:33:48.180,0:33:54.650
her back for the final on Thursday

0:33:51.030,0:33:57.460
evening Juliet Colton over great start

0:33:54.650,0:34:00.700
well she got now

0:33:57.460,0:34:03.130
well she sneaks that in she's very very

0:34:00.700,0:34:05.050
low on the water this is a tough dive

0:34:03.130,0:34:07.750
three point three degree of difficulty

0:34:05.050,0:34:09.640
but she's a tough diver here we go

0:34:07.750,0:34:11.920
jumping up as high as you can

0:34:09.640,0:34:13.690
squeezing into that tuck shake waiting

0:34:11.920,0:34:16.660
waiting waiting and then she pops out

0:34:13.690,0:34:20.280
with just oh just about enough time to

0:34:16.660,0:34:22.570
spare and she's done very well there

0:34:20.280,0:34:24.820
because that could have been a lot you

0:34:22.570,0:34:28.060
know shorter than it was she must keep

0:34:24.820,0:34:29.770
the splash down very good indeed judges

0:34:28.060,0:34:31.660
think they're sixty nine point three

0:34:29.770,0:34:33.970
zero remember all the marks without

0:34:31.660,0:34:36.070
lines through them count towards total

0:34:33.970,0:34:37.540
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

0:34:36.070,0:34:39.010
and those people cheering in all the

0:34:37.540,0:34:40.750
time so that's why we're reminding you

0:34:39.010,0:34:43.780
soon so I feel a bit fed up with our

0:34:40.750,0:34:45.370
explanations who you Dan sixteen from

0:34:43.780,0:34:47.860
China in with three and a half

0:34:45.370,0:34:49.480
somersaults with tuck we're three point

0:34:47.860,0:34:53.080
two in degree of difficulties and ballet

0:34:49.480,0:34:54.760
dancer's posture there Wow there's not

0:34:53.080,0:34:56.680
much of who you Dan and I'm always

0:34:54.760,0:34:58.720
surprised when I see her into the water

0:34:56.680,0:35:01.030
with that much splash I wonder how she

0:34:58.720,0:35:03.850
manages that normally we used to herd

0:35:01.030,0:35:06.070
disappearing into the water here we go

0:35:03.850,0:35:08.200
all looks good so far and then just goes

0:35:06.070,0:35:09.670
loose through the body and that's where

0:35:08.200,0:35:12.040
all the splash gets thrown out the

0:35:09.670,0:35:13.960
aerial work is spot-on she comes out

0:35:12.040,0:35:15.370
there dive hiking out really class he

0:35:13.960,0:35:17.440
doesn't lock out the elbows on the

0:35:15.370,0:35:18.910
finish and therefore gets let's have a

0:35:17.440,0:35:20.380
look doesn't quite yeah it doesn't quite

0:35:18.910,0:35:22.030
lock out the elbows and think it's like

0:35:20.380,0:35:23.980
a earthquake which goes right through

0:35:22.030,0:35:26.490
the body and it's a splash that holding

0:35:23.980,0:35:29.020
the back of a head she's hurt a neck or

0:35:26.490,0:35:32.170
tell me a word or two which probably

0:35:29.020,0:35:36.100
won't be any consolation for the Chinese

0:35:32.170,0:35:39.820
as we move to the Australian Melissa

0:35:36.100,0:35:41.260
whoop here comes the three point two we

0:35:39.820,0:35:43.270
will see a three point three by the way

0:35:41.260,0:35:46.680
very soon arm stand back double

0:35:43.270,0:35:46.680
somersault one and a half twists

0:35:51.300,0:35:59.470
well just entering the water short of

0:35:55.450,0:36:01.510
vertical which means that municipal you

0:35:59.470,0:36:03.040
won't get more than 6s on that just

0:36:01.510,0:36:05.170
needed a bit more of a pop off the top

0:36:03.040,0:36:07.330
there so needed to push with their arms

0:36:05.170,0:36:08.560
a little bit stronger just to give

0:36:07.330,0:36:13.180
yourself a little bit more clearance

0:36:08.560,0:36:15.100
going in it's a very neat dive until we

0:36:13.180,0:36:16.510
get into the water and then or just you

0:36:15.100,0:36:17.940
can see the water moving back towards

0:36:16.510,0:36:21.670
the diving board

0:36:17.940,0:36:23.080
yeah still waiting for somebody to take

0:36:21.670,0:36:26.860
this competition - scruff of the neck

0:36:23.080,0:36:30.640
and nobody yet he's doing so with 64

0:36:26.860,0:36:33.070
puts it into fifth place then comes her

0:36:30.640,0:36:39.220
teammate the younger of the two

0:36:33.070,0:36:42.940
Australians but no up 16 years of age is

0:36:39.220,0:36:46.030
Brittany Groban and it's a in with three

0:36:42.940,0:36:48.940
and a half we're tuck within degree of

0:36:46.030,0:36:51.130
difficulty three point two oh yes well

0:36:48.940,0:36:52.660
she nailed her first round died 71

0:36:51.130,0:36:56.080
points on a very low degree of

0:36:52.660,0:36:58.090
difficulty 2.7 this is three point two

0:36:56.080,0:37:00.850
and that is the best we've seen of the

0:36:58.090,0:37:03.640
competition so far what a tie from this

0:37:00.850,0:37:04.810
young lady only 16 years old and acting

0:37:03.640,0:37:07.600
like she's been in the Olympic Games

0:37:04.810,0:37:09.880
before this could get high 70s I'm not

0:37:07.600,0:37:12.070
sure whether the judges will be awake

0:37:09.880,0:37:14.620
enough to go higher than that but let's

0:37:12.070,0:37:19.030
wait and see well they like it and we

0:37:14.620,0:37:20.710
like it 81.6 0 for Brittany who has to

0:37:19.030,0:37:23.320
travel what two hours backwards and

0:37:20.710,0:37:25.000
forwards in Brisbane to do her diving up

0:37:23.320,0:37:28.470
at 4:15 every voice I don't think an

0:37:25.000,0:37:28.470
early start is worrying her too much

0:37:28.500,0:37:32.890
Kristen Stewart of Germany just upping

0:37:32.380,0:37:36.040
her

0:37:32.890,0:37:37.960
ante here 3.2 now for a back two and a

0:37:36.040,0:37:40.030
half somersaults with one and a half

0:37:37.960,0:37:42.250
twists and she's currently in 15th place

0:37:40.030,0:37:44.490
so need to move up three to be back

0:37:42.250,0:37:44.490
tonight

0:37:44.510,0:37:50.900
we have very very clean entry into the

0:37:48.440,0:37:52.790
water even though we're aerial work is

0:37:50.900,0:37:55.670
not as good as some of the other divers

0:37:52.790,0:37:58.280
story quite weak in comparison with her

0:37:55.670,0:38:00.859
takeoffs which means the die finishes a

0:37:58.280,0:38:03.140
little bit lower and some of her fellow

0:38:00.859,0:38:06.200
athletes but look at that entry into the

0:38:03.140,0:38:07.850
water I get seven and a half's you get

0:38:06.200,0:38:08.810
even more if she was able to jump a

0:38:07.850,0:38:10.400
little bit higher

0:38:08.810,0:38:14.180
that's three point two would be a good

0:38:10.400,0:38:16.760
total score - it is we're seven point

0:38:14.180,0:38:18.410
five times the degree of difficulty

0:38:16.760,0:38:19.520
there we get landing in those Olympic

0:38:18.410,0:38:20.750
rings yet if they're landing in the

0:38:19.520,0:38:23.720
Olympic rings they've gone a bit too far

0:38:20.750,0:38:27.859
so a bit of a marker for you and Ella

0:38:23.720,0:38:29.810
hand of Malaysia well in the prelims

0:38:27.859,0:38:31.490
here she goes with dive number two in

0:38:29.810,0:38:36.530
the semi final back two and a half

0:38:31.490,0:38:39.230
somersaults with Mike 2.9 she nailed it

0:38:36.530,0:38:40.280
in the prelims and she's done it exactly

0:38:39.230,0:38:42.560
the same again there we are

0:38:40.280,0:38:45.170
the coach is capturing every single dive

0:38:42.560,0:38:46.550
for post diving analysis this is what

0:38:45.170,0:38:49.460
you did well this is what you could do

0:38:46.550,0:38:51.650
better next time and another beautiful

0:38:49.460,0:38:53.960
diving coming out the dive very very

0:38:51.650,0:38:55.430
early so need 2.9 to grip difficulty so

0:38:53.960,0:38:58.609
it needed to be nails I think she'll get

0:38:55.430,0:39:02.480
a bag full of nines for this and so she

0:38:58.609,0:39:04.160
should superb diving spectacular yeah

0:39:02.480,0:39:06.230
she's good she was good last night she's

0:39:04.160,0:39:09.590
good today seventy five point four zero

0:39:06.230,0:39:13.250
for Pandora and that will lift her up

0:39:09.590,0:39:14.330
the standings more people concentrating

0:39:13.250,0:39:18.080
and wondering whether they'll be back

0:39:14.330,0:39:22.130
tonight 7 World Series victories this

0:39:18.080,0:39:23.960
year for this lady general in the

0:39:22.130,0:39:26.119
Olympic and World Champion in with three

0:39:23.960,0:39:31.070
and a half summer sorts with tuck three

0:39:26.119,0:39:35.780
point two second at the moment and into

0:39:31.070,0:39:37.580
the lead she goes Wow people wandering

0:39:35.780,0:39:40.310
off shaky first round dive from the

0:39:37.580,0:39:41.960
Olympic champion will she will she come

0:39:40.310,0:39:44.210
out all guns blazing in my own umber to

0:39:41.960,0:39:47.359
the answer is yes this will go sailing

0:39:44.210,0:39:51.500
over 80 points beautiful entry into the

0:39:47.359,0:39:53.390
water look at that overhead shot very

0:39:51.500,0:39:56.280
strong safe distance from the diving

0:39:53.390,0:39:59.730
board technically nyeon perfect

0:39:56.280,0:40:01.800
great dive hard after the prelim see

0:39:59.730,0:40:04.770
anybody beating up and on the evidence

0:40:01.800,0:40:08.700
of that I've seen to be topping her in

0:40:04.770,0:40:13.830
the semis either general in eighty 3.20

0:40:08.700,0:40:15.840
last to go in round two so a lot of

0:40:13.830,0:40:18.300
cogitation and contemplation going on

0:40:15.840,0:40:20.070
between the a team divers as they try

0:40:18.300,0:40:22.800
and work out what they need to do to

0:40:20.070,0:40:25.110
qualify not a problem for Chen or indeed

0:40:22.800,0:40:28.380
for browbone at the moment down to nine

0:40:25.110,0:40:29.870
fairly secure it gets a little bit more

0:40:28.380,0:40:32.640
wobbly and a little bit more anxious

0:40:29.870,0:40:34.680
certainly for Brittany viola who's not

0:40:32.640,0:40:36.900
in there rosin in Philly on who's not in

0:40:34.680,0:40:39.300
there and look at that how that's

0:40:36.900,0:40:41.930
Espinoza Sanchez bronze medalist from

0:40:39.300,0:40:45.410
last year at the World Championships 16

0:40:41.930,0:40:45.410
after round two

0:40:49.620,0:40:52.860
on to Round three and spray could Jesse

0:40:51.960,0:40:54.800
round they were we're trying to find

0:40:52.860,0:40:57.900
their little place to have it at all

0:40:54.800,0:41:00.000
maybe a little nap listen to some music

0:40:57.900,0:41:02.790
get back in the concentration zone cos a

0:41:00.000,0:41:04.650
long time between dives for them not as

0:41:02.790,0:41:06.180
long as it was in the semis in their

0:41:04.650,0:41:09.450
fighting their prelims but in the series

0:41:06.180,0:41:13.350
they have to wait with 20 minutes we get

0:41:09.450,0:41:16.620
a chance to go again here's Kim Wong

0:41:13.350,0:41:20.060
yang are the People's Republic of Korea

0:41:16.620,0:41:22.500
this is the bigger of the arm stand back

0:41:20.060,0:41:26.480
somersaults is a triple in the Tuck

0:41:22.500,0:41:29.460
position three point three this is worth

0:41:26.480,0:41:32.330
well Kim's having the meat of her life

0:41:29.460,0:41:34.980
Wow only just getting into this

0:41:32.330,0:41:36.600
semi-final and that is three out of

0:41:34.980,0:41:38.970
three and that's the most difficult dive

0:41:36.600,0:41:41.540
here we are in the handstand the donkey

0:41:38.970,0:41:44.100
kick is it's sometimes known flaking in

0:41:41.540,0:41:46.170
generating the rotation and she sneaks

0:41:44.100,0:41:48.030
her entry and that could get 70 points

0:41:46.170,0:41:50.100
and if it does this young lady will be

0:41:48.030,0:41:53.370
well within the reach of an Olympic

0:41:50.100,0:41:55.260
final well she was 12th of the World Cup

0:41:53.370,0:41:57.690
meeting here earlier in the year how she

0:41:55.260,0:41:59.490
likes this venue likes that diving board

0:41:57.690,0:42:02.550
likes the atmosphere in this place

0:41:59.490,0:42:06.980
seventy point nine five the Kim she's

0:42:02.550,0:42:10.410
the first of the divers to go above 200

0:42:06.980,0:42:14.160
mostly in Philly on not seen the best of

0:42:10.410,0:42:15.450
her so far 14th place she currently

0:42:14.160,0:42:18.450
stands means she would not be returning

0:42:15.450,0:42:21.090
but plenty of time to make up that

0:42:18.450,0:42:21.600
margin three point two in were three and

0:42:21.090,0:42:25.680
a half

0:42:21.600,0:42:27.690
we're tuk for the Canadian oh it needed

0:42:25.680,0:42:29.310
to be better than that she's struggling

0:42:27.690,0:42:31.830
with of entries today you can see lots

0:42:29.310,0:42:33.780
of the divers in Roseland there with

0:42:31.830,0:42:37.590
huge wrist supports because of the

0:42:33.780,0:42:39.690
impact into the water and really she

0:42:37.590,0:42:41.670
needed to be cleaner in just going loose

0:42:39.690,0:42:43.560
through the body she goes in throwing up

0:42:41.670,0:42:45.930
a load of splash it will get sevens

0:42:43.560,0:42:48.750
maybe live less because of the amount of

0:42:45.930,0:42:50.940
splash and she'll still be struggling

0:42:48.750,0:42:53.010
and see yeah couldn't quite get the

0:42:50.940,0:42:54.450
hands together to punch that clean entry

0:42:53.010,0:42:56.610
into the water she knows what she did

0:42:54.450,0:42:58.770
wrong normally when she's performing

0:42:56.610,0:43:00.830
well as a big broad smile on her face

0:42:58.770,0:43:02.570
it's just a grimace

0:43:00.830,0:43:03.920
and facial expressions probably tell you

0:43:02.570,0:43:06.740
all you need to know about how this

0:43:03.920,0:43:08.270
competition is unfolding for her 64

0:43:06.740,0:43:11.660
doesn't really cut it

0:43:08.270,0:43:13.930
she needs to be looking at 70s and 6161

0:43:11.660,0:43:19.970
64 so far

0:43:13.930,0:43:21.560
Maria Carillo of Germany down to the 2.8

0:43:19.970,0:43:23.270
s now so she's not gonna make up much

0:43:21.560,0:43:24.950
ground with this and this is absolutely

0:43:23.270,0:43:30.590
perfect an inward two and a half summer

0:43:24.950,0:43:32.000
sorts with pike oh no she's way over way

0:43:30.590,0:43:34.010
over the in were two and a half in the

0:43:32.000,0:43:35.870
pike position importantly move away from

0:43:34.010,0:43:38.660
the diamond but we saw Nakagawa hit her

0:43:35.870,0:43:41.690
toes on this dive no mistakes here for

0:43:38.660,0:43:42.920
Maria moves away oh no she does she hits

0:43:41.690,0:43:45.080
the diving board but I didn't notice

0:43:42.920,0:43:47.390
that but she doesn't land flat on her

0:43:45.080,0:43:48.950
back maybe that was the reason why so

0:43:47.390,0:43:49.820
the judges are penalized because of the

0:43:48.950,0:43:51.710
entry into the water

0:43:49.820,0:43:53.480
yeah just tipping her toes slightly

0:43:51.710,0:43:56.450
they're not quite a big dunk like

0:43:53.480,0:43:58.370
Nakagawa but it was just a little scrape

0:43:56.450,0:44:00.980
big donk in terms of the score though

0:43:58.370,0:44:04.760
whew thirty three point six zero four

0:44:00.980,0:44:06.830
was count towards a total it's a meager

0:44:04.760,0:44:08.780
one and that will drop her right down

0:44:06.830,0:44:12.470
she wasn't in the top 12 anyway she's

0:44:08.780,0:44:16.490
gonna be even further adrift now Kim Jin

0:44:12.470,0:44:18.290
Ock all the People's Republic Korea 21

0:44:16.490,0:44:19.760
year old she wasn't semi-finalists in

0:44:18.290,0:44:22.100
Beijing and at the last two World

0:44:19.760,0:44:24.110
Championships oh she's emulated that and

0:44:22.100,0:44:26.750
the moment she's on course to go to the

0:44:24.110,0:44:31.060
final back three and a half summer sorts

0:44:26.750,0:44:35.110
with tuck top degree of difficulty 3.30

0:44:31.060,0:44:37.460
no she's made a little bit of an air up

0:44:35.110,0:44:38.690
it wasn't so good in training I was

0:44:37.460,0:44:42.350
watching this is always gonna be the

0:44:38.690,0:44:44.810
bogey die for her I think that's gonna

0:44:42.350,0:44:45.560
put pressure on her making it through to

0:44:44.810,0:44:47.450
the final

0:44:45.560,0:44:49.430
just waiting too long in the shape as

0:44:47.450,0:44:53.210
you can see that over vertical loads of

0:44:49.430,0:44:54.800
splash coming up well she'll get

0:44:53.210,0:44:56.240
penalized heavily from the judges and

0:44:54.800,0:44:59.570
she has some work to do on her two

0:44:56.240,0:45:03.650
remaining dives down among the very low

0:44:59.570,0:45:08.300
marks at moment 33 followed by 44 only

0:45:03.650,0:45:10.660
4.5 s on a high tariff dive but a big

0:45:08.300,0:45:14.000
dent in her hopes of coming back

0:45:10.660,0:45:17.510
now onto bristly viola missed the whole

0:45:14.000,0:45:19.990
of 2010 covering from two foot surgeries

0:45:17.510,0:45:22.340
they really are patched together and

0:45:19.990,0:45:24.110
just held together with bits a string

0:45:22.340,0:45:25.790
and bits of plaster sometimes on these

0:45:24.110,0:45:28.040
divers especially on the 10 meter board

0:45:25.790,0:45:31.040
here she is with her in with three and a

0:45:28.040,0:45:33.650
half some sorts with tuck 3.2 just

0:45:31.040,0:45:36.860
outside the qualification places in 13

0:45:33.650,0:45:38.570
oh and that might not meet well that

0:45:36.860,0:45:41.540
definitely won't move up into contention

0:45:38.570,0:45:43.100
to make this final real shame just

0:45:41.540,0:45:44.540
needed to be a little bit more confident

0:45:43.100,0:45:47.090
on the exit of the dive there the

0:45:44.540,0:45:48.590
takeoff is good she squeezes in tight

0:45:47.090,0:45:50.510
just comes out a little bit too early

0:45:48.590,0:45:53.330
and then enters the water with the

0:45:50.510,0:45:55.070
backside sticking out which is incorrect

0:45:53.330,0:45:56.330
you need to be completely vertical so

0:45:55.070,0:45:58.430
you just straighten out a little bit

0:45:56.330,0:46:01.130
more wow that's not even going to get

0:45:58.430,0:46:02.600
over 50 points I don't think super

0:46:01.130,0:46:09.010
slow-motion just showing you there that

0:46:02.600,0:46:14.900
she isn't quite completing the dive mmm

0:46:09.010,0:46:16.580
49 follows of 44 follows of 33 and at

0:46:14.900,0:46:18.530
the moment the judge is not seeing what

0:46:16.580,0:46:21.950
they want and the die was not performing

0:46:18.530,0:46:25.810
the way they want either and the big

0:46:21.950,0:46:28.610
shake-up going on in the pecking order

0:46:25.810,0:46:32.470
Espinoza Sanchez reverse three and a

0:46:28.610,0:46:32.470
half three point three with tuck

0:46:40.330,0:46:46.450
oh it's better that's she is the only

0:46:43.750,0:46:49.240
diver doing this dive in the competition

0:46:46.450,0:46:50.980
they reverse three and a half we used to

0:46:49.240,0:46:52.420
be three point four degree of difficulty

0:46:50.980,0:46:54.670
now it's only three point three and I

0:46:52.420,0:46:56.230
disagree with that downgrading I think

0:46:54.670,0:46:58.390
FINA have got it completely wrong there

0:46:56.230,0:47:00.640
this is super tricky you only ever see

0:46:58.390,0:47:02.860
the men perform this dive Espinoza

0:47:00.640,0:47:03.220
showing her class here but not nailing

0:47:02.860,0:47:06.490
it

0:47:03.220,0:47:10.030
Wow will we see a shock are we seeing a

0:47:06.490,0:47:11.980
shock is she gonna make it through no

0:47:10.030,0:47:15.010
fifty six point one zero doesn't

0:47:11.980,0:47:17.170
indicate she will and she's got two more

0:47:15.010,0:47:19.030
rounds to get this right and to turn it

0:47:17.170,0:47:24.480
around and she's giving herself an awful

0:47:19.030,0:47:26.950
lot to do there meat bat keep of Italy

0:47:24.480,0:47:28.810
back two and a half of somersaults one

0:47:26.950,0:47:35.530
and a half twists currently in 17th

0:47:28.810,0:47:38.830
place so needs to step it up now yeah

0:47:35.530,0:47:41.140
it's one of her better dives 3.2 yep the

0:47:38.830,0:47:42.520
back two and a half somersaults with one

0:47:41.140,0:47:44.710
and a half twist you've seen lots and

0:47:42.520,0:47:46.750
lots of girls using this this morning

0:47:44.710,0:47:48.280
here we go generating the rotations

0:47:46.750,0:47:51.210
swinging the arms wrapping into the

0:47:48.280,0:47:53.530
twist this is a twist group of dive here

0:47:51.210,0:47:55.540
most of the girls will use this dive

0:47:53.530,0:47:56.890
this morning they just choose to use it

0:47:55.540,0:47:59.590
at different times you can place your

0:47:56.890,0:48:01.420
dives in any order you choose to so it's

0:47:59.590,0:48:02.920
often a game of tactics when do you use

0:48:01.420,0:48:07.060
your best dive when do you use your

0:48:02.920,0:48:08.710
weakest dive so bhakti was still some

0:48:07.060,0:48:09.220
work to do after a poor second round

0:48:08.710,0:48:11.110
dive

0:48:09.220,0:48:13.660
whoopee we're into the seventies at last

0:48:11.110,0:48:15.280
we've waited a while for that 72 for

0:48:13.660,0:48:16.930
back heat and with everybody else

0:48:15.280,0:48:18.970
faltering it does move her up a few

0:48:16.930,0:48:22.990
spots getting closer to qualification

0:48:18.970,0:48:27.130
now yulia Ragab chuck of ukraine back

0:48:22.990,0:48:28.990
two and a half only 2.9 on this oh it's

0:48:27.130,0:48:30.850
pretty good a little bit too much splash

0:48:28.990,0:48:33.880
being thrown up but it's very neat and

0:48:30.850,0:48:35.500
tidy 2.9 degree of difficulty lower than

0:48:33.880,0:48:37.930
what we've been seeing so it needed to

0:48:35.500,0:48:40.030
be good this young lady's going very

0:48:37.930,0:48:42.670
well this morning one of the few

0:48:40.030,0:48:45.100
actually beautiful Pike shape great toe

0:48:42.670,0:48:47.380
point just tipping over there as she

0:48:45.100,0:48:48.630
went into the water so probably maybe a

0:48:47.380,0:48:51.580
couple of sevens

0:48:48.630,0:48:52.970
see how mean the judges are but she does

0:48:51.580,0:48:54.920
go over

0:48:52.970,0:48:57.590
I'm not sure I think a judge you get a

0:48:54.920,0:48:59.840
bit fed up with this you know 6.5 rather

0:48:57.590,0:49:02.359
than sevens just waiting for somebody to

0:48:59.840,0:49:04.099
set like to this competition and really

0:49:02.359,0:49:06.440
make us in theater seen some good time

0:49:04.099,0:49:08.660
here caused by the Chinese but outside

0:49:06.440,0:49:10.280
that open from Australian TV know it's

0:49:08.660,0:49:13.130
very good to be fair that's right we've

0:49:10.280,0:49:15.440
had to but the majority of divers are

0:49:13.130,0:49:17.240
funny really hard this morning to get

0:49:15.440,0:49:19.880
going now Megan Ben feet oh now is your

0:49:17.240,0:49:22.190
time fourth in Shanghai world champs

0:49:19.880,0:49:24.200
fourth in Rome in with three-and-a-half

0:49:22.190,0:49:27.109
somersaults were tuck three point two

0:49:24.200,0:49:29.260
for the Canadian currently in fourth

0:49:27.109,0:49:29.260
place

0:49:31.540,0:49:39.310
yep she sneaks it in there's a coach

0:49:34.760,0:49:42.619
Archer Miranda showing his appreciation

0:49:39.310,0:49:44.150
because it's all about being consistent

0:49:42.619,0:49:47.090
in this young lady that's three out of

0:49:44.150,0:49:49.369
three for her it's a little low on the

0:49:47.090,0:49:50.990
water but she still gets in seven and a

0:49:49.369,0:49:52.970
half so I think coming her way just

0:49:50.990,0:49:55.430
showing the ankle snap there on the

0:49:52.970,0:49:58.160
take-off in order to generate the

0:49:55.430,0:50:01.880
rotation that's a lot of dive to fit in

0:49:58.160,0:50:03.650
it's three point two another day seventy

0:50:01.880,0:50:05.480
point four zero wouldn't be that special

0:50:03.650,0:50:07.460
but today it pretty much is because

0:50:05.480,0:50:09.619
nobody's getting into that kind of a

0:50:07.460,0:50:13.790
Charlotte at the moment now welcome to

0:50:09.619,0:50:16.250
the Katie Bell chat show little chats

0:50:13.790,0:50:20.109
with self their chance it to herself the

0:50:16.250,0:50:20.109
reposition of the feet about ten times

0:50:20.980,0:50:28.540
now the inward three-and-a-half to

0:50:24.099,0:50:33.190
follow we tuck 3.2 over 24 year old

0:50:28.540,0:50:36.070
American oh wow

0:50:33.190,0:50:38.349
so first two were good and the third one

0:50:36.070,0:50:41.260
which she actually did a great job in

0:50:38.349,0:50:44.170
the prelim she's made a mistake oh she's

0:50:41.260,0:50:45.760
near the diving board and then maybe she

0:50:44.170,0:50:48.940
knows she is so she hangs on way too

0:50:45.760,0:50:50.980
long look at that huge wave back towards

0:50:48.940,0:50:53.859
the diving board they're showing that

0:50:50.980,0:50:56.650
she's over rotated that's gonna be super

0:50:53.859,0:50:58.329
low 30s yeah I think we were a little

0:50:56.650,0:50:59.829
sport with the men's three meter the

0:50:58.329,0:51:01.660
other night I think we expected the

0:50:59.829,0:51:04.150
level to continue and it just has it

0:51:01.660,0:51:08.079
with the women so far maybe the final is

0:51:04.150,0:51:09.609
where things will really take off no

0:51:08.079,0:51:12.250
these divers are taking off the way they

0:51:09.609,0:51:13.630
want thirty five point two zero and she

0:51:12.250,0:51:15.760
may not be returning tonight

0:51:13.630,0:51:17.640
it's a battle of those who who don't

0:51:15.760,0:51:21.460
want to make it rather than those who do

0:51:17.640,0:51:23.349
my Nakagawa up to the top of her range

0:51:21.460,0:51:28.270
three point three back three and a half

0:51:23.349,0:51:31.030
summer sorts for the Japanese oh my is

0:51:28.270,0:51:34.510
having a very very tough day out there

0:51:31.030,0:51:36.790
how frustrating she is a very good

0:51:34.510,0:51:38.619
divers he's a super been terrific dies

0:51:36.790,0:51:41.230
from her in the polymer he's one of the

0:51:38.619,0:51:43.119
few who were shining hitting her feet on

0:51:41.230,0:51:45.280
the first dive and that is completely

0:51:43.119,0:51:48.310
thrown her for for three and a half last

0:51:45.280,0:51:50.050
round was mediocre and this one as well

0:51:48.310,0:51:51.670
her most difficult dive be back with

0:51:50.050,0:51:53.800
three and a half in the top position

0:51:51.670,0:51:55.900
very poor indeed what a shame for

0:51:53.800,0:51:57.460
Nakagawa she's a great diver and she

0:51:55.900,0:51:58.270
will definitely not be going through to

0:51:57.460,0:52:01.740
the final

0:51:58.270,0:52:05.980
that's three poor dives oh my oh my

0:52:01.740,0:52:07.750
42.9 zero for Nakagawa yeah she's not

0:52:05.980,0:52:10.780
giving herself really much of a chance

0:52:07.750,0:52:12.400
of making it through other people

0:52:10.780,0:52:16.630
faltering but she's fortunately more

0:52:12.400,0:52:18.369
than most yulia colton over russia for

0:52:16.630,0:52:19.230
three and a half he get to get on with

0:52:18.369,0:52:22.000
it

0:52:19.230,0:52:23.560
no yet and you can see why she wants to

0:52:22.000,0:52:26.140
get her dives done that's three out of

0:52:23.560,0:52:29.740
three for the twenty three-year-old from

0:52:26.140,0:52:31.900
russia some good diving last night

0:52:29.740,0:52:33.700
finishing in the business end of the

0:52:31.900,0:52:34.540
field and i'm pretty sure with another

0:52:33.700,0:52:36.160
two

0:52:34.540,0:52:41.110
dives have this standard she will

0:52:36.160,0:52:42.970
continue to move up the pack Olympic

0:52:41.110,0:52:45.430
medal all the way back in Athens very

0:52:42.970,0:52:47.020
very young then with her partner in the

0:52:45.430,0:52:50.200
synchronized ten meter and here she is

0:52:47.020,0:52:52.240
her third Olympic Games yeah six 7.50

0:52:50.200,0:52:55.510
that's by the standard this morning

0:52:52.240,0:52:57.310
pretty decent and that will put her for

0:52:55.510,0:53:00.700
the time being at least at the top of

0:52:57.310,0:53:02.080
the pile second in Shanghai winner in

0:53:00.700,0:53:05.470
Sheffield you may have seen her last

0:53:02.080,0:53:09.160
year in the grand prix event up there 16

0:53:05.470,0:53:12.280
year old who you Dan and it's armstand

0:53:09.160,0:53:14.410
time everybody hold your breath double

0:53:12.280,0:53:16.890
somersault one and a half twists free

0:53:14.410,0:53:16.890
position

0:53:23.420,0:53:28.140
well that's more like it from who you

0:53:25.980,0:53:30.090
Dan still throwing up a little bit too

0:53:28.140,0:53:32.130
much splash for my liking but the entry

0:53:30.090,0:53:33.750
into the water was vertical and just

0:53:32.130,0:53:36.300
used to see in this young lady or young

0:53:33.750,0:53:37.440
16 year old dive so much better than

0:53:36.300,0:53:39.930
this it'll get eights

0:53:37.440,0:53:42.090
but I've seen a score nines and upwards

0:53:39.930,0:53:44.340
on this and Wally's missing on that it's

0:53:42.090,0:53:46.800
a splash the century and I'm surprised I

0:53:44.340,0:53:48.450
haven't seen her go into the water

0:53:46.800,0:53:51.860
completely clean as yet in this

0:53:48.450,0:53:54.210
competition or in the preliminaries

0:53:51.860,0:53:57.630
that means two medals are up for grabs

0:53:54.210,0:53:59.880
if who doesn't up her game to what she

0:53:57.630,0:54:01.110
can do generally and at the end looks

0:53:59.880,0:54:04.740
pretty untouchable though at the moment

0:54:01.110,0:54:07.020
here doesn't you just 8.04 who you Dan

0:54:04.740,0:54:09.630
seventy six point eight zero ko she sent

0:54:07.020,0:54:12.050
me a chat going over the dive and the

0:54:09.630,0:54:16.500
pupil is taking it all on board

0:54:12.050,0:54:19.050
Melissa woo sixth in Beijing at the

0:54:16.500,0:54:20.700
World Championships in Rome in 2009 back

0:54:19.050,0:54:22.830
three and a half somersaults three point

0:54:20.700,0:54:24.000
three in the comfort zone at the moment

0:54:22.830,0:54:28.950
in position eight but we've seen what

0:54:24.000,0:54:30.990
can happen to the others well done

0:54:28.950,0:54:32.820
Melissa there's Matthew Mitchum an

0:54:30.990,0:54:35.460
Olympic champion from Beijing in the

0:54:32.820,0:54:37.230
platform event cheering on whistling

0:54:35.460,0:54:39.570
away and Melissa and she's done very

0:54:37.230,0:54:41.820
well there the take-off is weak so she

0:54:39.570,0:54:43.950
has to wait and wait and wait and then

0:54:41.820,0:54:45.360
she pops out at the right time very neat

0:54:43.950,0:54:46.890
little bit short of vertical she'll

0:54:45.360,0:54:50.370
probably sneak sevens from the judges

0:54:46.890,0:54:52.110
and that's a good effort especially when

0:54:50.370,0:54:54.750
those around are losing their heads and

0:54:52.110,0:54:58.020
faltering like a house of cards out

0:54:54.750,0:55:00.090
there again like the prelims yeah solid

0:54:58.020,0:55:01.890
sixty nine point three exactly of the

0:55:00.090,0:55:03.240
prelims it's with obviously fewer

0:55:01.890,0:55:04.590
competitors this time but they're just

0:55:03.240,0:55:07.830
following on where they left off last

0:55:04.590,0:55:10.820
night now the very impressive today

0:55:07.830,0:55:13.380
sixteen year old Brittany Brogan and

0:55:10.820,0:55:17.250
she's gonna go for the arm stand as well

0:55:13.380,0:55:21.080
falling off the back Australian

0:55:17.250,0:55:23.760
colleague seen this a few times already

0:55:21.080,0:55:25.980
three point two degree of difficulty on

0:55:23.760,0:55:29.010
the arm stand back double somersaults

0:55:25.980,0:55:36.930
with one on half twists

0:55:29.010,0:55:39.210
oh great technique very very strong on

0:55:36.930,0:55:42.119
the takeoff and she packs it right up

0:55:39.210,0:55:44.490
with another nailed entry we're looking

0:55:42.119,0:55:46.350
for splash the sentries and the judges

0:55:44.490,0:55:49.380
are gonna award that very highly indeed

0:55:46.350,0:55:51.390
Wow what an impressive performance if

0:55:49.380,0:55:53.910
this young lady continues to dive like

0:55:51.390,0:55:56.700
this and she can replicate this in the

0:55:53.910,0:55:58.260
final well I'm going to put my money on

0:55:56.700,0:55:59.609
her for a medal how about that

0:55:58.260,0:56:01.380
you're going to go out on a limb I'm

0:55:59.609,0:56:02.910
with you gets a good odds for us we're

0:56:01.380,0:56:06.240
although we're not allowed to back to

0:56:02.910,0:56:08.190
work for the BBC but your army seventy

0:56:06.240,0:56:11.280
six point eight zero and can have a

0:56:08.190,0:56:12.960
sportsman's bet if you like I go back to

0:56:11.280,0:56:15.720
school in there well you actually old

0:56:12.960,0:56:17.940
enough to bet okay seventy six point

0:56:15.720,0:56:20.910
eight four broman takes her twelve

0:56:17.940,0:56:24.810
points clear now Kristin steer is gonna

0:56:20.910,0:56:28.290
go for the same thing can she get

0:56:24.810,0:56:32.750
anywhere near the 76s tent at the moment

0:56:28.290,0:56:32.750
so coming back tonight for the Sammy's

0:56:33.890,0:56:37.980
again yeah going from strength to

0:56:36.390,0:56:40.560
strength as she did in the preliminaries

0:56:37.980,0:56:43.470
that week first round dive but this

0:56:40.560,0:56:45.570
against row a little bit you know she

0:56:43.470,0:56:47.609
struggles on the takeoffs and this one

0:56:45.570,0:56:49.050
is well it's actually okay but you can

0:56:47.609,0:56:52.800
see if finishing quite low to the water

0:56:49.050,0:56:54.300
and she somehow manages to sneak a rip

0:56:52.800,0:56:56.160
entry and that could get a seven and a

0:56:54.300,0:56:57.480
half which because of the degree of

0:56:56.160,0:56:59.130
difficulty three point two should go

0:56:57.480,0:57:02.220
over seventy points and that's a good

0:56:59.130,0:57:05.280
score anything over seventy this morning

0:57:02.220,0:57:11.280
is very impressive because it's been a

0:57:05.280,0:57:14.310
rarity and seventy-two it is now and a

0:57:11.280,0:57:17.220
pang you come all the armed stand in a

0:57:14.310,0:57:19.650
rush exactly the same one say we do go

0:57:17.220,0:57:23.400
up to three point three on some of the

0:57:19.650,0:57:26.820
arm stands but and not trying to cram it

0:57:23.400,0:57:29.790
all in slightly easier that's all

0:57:26.820,0:57:31.530
relative of course back double

0:57:29.790,0:57:34.760
somersault with one and a half twists

0:57:31.530,0:57:34.760
currently in fifth place

0:57:35.530,0:57:39.970
now you're getting to see like for like

0:57:37.510,0:57:42.430
here so the previous you know three

0:57:39.970,0:57:43.930
divers now including pendolino have

0:57:42.430,0:57:45.550
performed this and Schembri limb will

0:57:43.930,0:57:47.730
perform it after as well so it's really

0:57:45.550,0:57:49.690
nice to see there's slightly different

0:57:47.730,0:57:52.180
elevations that the girls are getting

0:57:49.690,0:57:53.710
from their you know take offs handle

0:57:52.180,0:57:55.210
eller they're just cranking the dive a

0:57:53.710,0:57:57.280
little bit too much a little bit too

0:57:55.210,0:57:59.830
much rotation here which means that she

0:57:57.280,0:58:01.930
rolls over a vertical which is a shame

0:57:59.830,0:58:03.610
because if she'd have just popped it up

0:58:01.930,0:58:05.980
a little bit higher then she'd have had

0:58:03.610,0:58:09.790
more control on the entry but still very

0:58:05.980,0:58:12.310
consistent today 70 points a dive mmm

0:58:09.790,0:58:14.170
that's what the coach is instructing her

0:58:12.310,0:58:16.000
obviously too late for this round but

0:58:14.170,0:58:17.920
that's what she needs to do tonight when

0:58:16.000,0:58:21.580
surely she will return she's currently

0:58:17.920,0:58:23.530
in fifth place but they class act she

0:58:21.580,0:58:24.820
was so far ahead of the field last night

0:58:23.530,0:58:26.920
it was untrue like she was in a

0:58:24.820,0:58:31.020
completely different competition the

0:58:26.920,0:58:31.020
olympic and world champion chain rule in

0:58:32.910,0:58:40.000
1920 later this year arm stand back

0:58:35.230,0:58:42.880
double again oh yeah yes well almost

0:58:40.000,0:58:44.380
completely ripped entry just throwing up

0:58:42.880,0:58:48.820
a little bit too much splash great

0:58:44.380,0:58:50.620
takeoff very well super control one and

0:58:48.820,0:58:53.380
a half twist double somersault in she

0:58:50.620,0:58:55.860
goes extending a lead with that one I'm

0:58:53.380,0:58:58.950
sure she'll get close to 80 points

0:58:55.860,0:59:01.810
fantastic third round dive from Chen

0:58:58.950,0:59:05.290
well I'm tempted to say put the gold

0:59:01.810,0:59:07.030
medal around her neck now but until you

0:59:05.290,0:59:08.890
have a final to come yet the five more

0:59:07.030,0:59:10.740
dives this evening and things can go

0:59:08.890,0:59:13.060
wrong as we have seen this morning but

0:59:10.740,0:59:15.970
she's been on top of her game when

0:59:13.060,0:59:19.510
others have been faltering and she has a

0:59:15.970,0:59:21.580
lead of nine points over the rest of the

0:59:19.510,0:59:24.040
field so after round three two more to

0:59:21.580,0:59:26.590
come five rounds in women's six rounds

0:59:24.040,0:59:29.950
in men's we are looking for the top 12

0:59:26.590,0:59:34.930
to progress to the final tonight and all

0:59:29.950,0:59:37.720
nine of them are there so far see those

0:59:34.930,0:59:40.390
who are scrapping for the minor places

0:59:37.720,0:59:42.370
Rosalie and Finney on in eleventh so we

0:59:40.390,0:59:45.460
lose back key viola we are going to lose

0:59:42.370,0:59:47.660
Paolo Espinosa Sanchez that's a huge

0:59:45.460,0:59:50.839
surprise really is

0:59:47.660,0:59:53.809
she's made KC bail as well who really

0:59:50.839,0:59:58.630
good sequence of dives last night so a

0:59:53.809,1:00:01.450
couple of big casualties on the way and

0:59:58.630,1:00:04.220
that I was locked into their music

1:00:01.450,1:00:08.569
knocked into perhaps their emails and

1:00:04.220,1:00:14.900
their Twitter accounts trying to take

1:00:08.569,1:00:17.690
themselves awake now on to round four of

1:00:14.900,1:00:25.520
the women's 10-meter platform a semi

1:00:17.690,1:00:28.250
final top 12 to progress yang is doing

1:00:25.520,1:00:30.020
just that she's ninth place going into a

1:00:28.250,1:00:31.670
pan ultimate dive which is the back

1:00:30.020,1:00:33.920
three and a half somersaults with tuck

1:00:31.670,1:00:36.230
three point three is the degree of

1:00:33.920,1:00:42.430
difficulty on the opening dive of round

1:00:36.230,1:00:45.049
four or you could prove to be critical

1:00:42.430,1:00:47.930
Kim of course nailing three out of three

1:00:45.049,1:00:50.839
wow that's a biggest degree of

1:00:47.930,1:00:54.680
difficulty and she hasn't completed the

1:00:50.839,1:00:56.329
dive and shorter vertical and that could

1:00:54.680,1:00:59.210
see her missing out on a place in the

1:00:56.329,1:01:03.589
final that's a real shame you know

1:00:59.210,1:01:05.270
thirty sixty three 67 and 70 and she's

1:01:03.589,1:01:07.400
gonna be nowhere near that with the

1:01:05.270,1:01:10.700
marks on this one what the judges say

1:01:07.400,1:01:13.250
forty one point two five how to undo a

1:01:10.700,1:01:16.970
great sequence of dives in one fail

1:01:13.250,1:01:18.609
swoop spin the leaf of time being but

1:01:16.970,1:01:22.150
she's not gonna stay there for very long

1:01:18.609,1:01:25.069
I'll go hurtling down the standings

1:01:22.150,1:01:28.190
there's no margin for error for Rosaline

1:01:25.069,1:01:32.859
filly on either of Canada and this is

1:01:28.190,1:01:38.329
the slightly more detailed if you like

1:01:32.859,1:01:39.920
I'm stand 33.3 just trying to get

1:01:38.329,1:01:42.520
together there's a triple somersault on

1:01:39.920,1:01:42.520
the back of this

1:01:44.910,1:01:51.090
oh she's waited until now to stake her

1:01:49.170,1:01:52.800
claim she was in 11th after the third

1:01:51.090,1:01:54.570
round so this needed to be good this is

1:01:52.800,1:01:57.510
a highest degree of difficulty equal

1:01:54.570,1:01:59.610
highest three point three so armstand

1:01:57.510,1:02:01.410
flicking there we are strong flick

1:01:59.610,1:02:03.450
intercept just holding on to the top of

1:02:01.410,1:02:05.700
her kneecaps there well that's the first

1:02:03.450,1:02:07.710
entry that she's almost got on this one

1:02:05.700,1:02:09.240
that's going to get sevens and 7.5 s

1:02:07.710,1:02:10.830
which means with the degree of

1:02:09.240,1:02:13.380
difficulty of three point three she'll

1:02:10.830,1:02:15.150
be over 70 points and has bobbers

1:02:13.380,1:02:17.160
mentioned anything over 70 points will

1:02:15.150,1:02:19.830
put you well in contention for making a

1:02:17.160,1:02:22.200
spot in the final yeah so providing

1:02:19.830,1:02:23.880
nothing goes terribly wrong in the last

1:02:22.200,1:02:26.970
round she should be there seventy four

1:02:23.880,1:02:31.140
point two five for Rosaline a 25

1:02:26.970,1:02:37.760
year-old from Canada not being maria

1:02:31.140,1:02:40.920
Kayo's de from berlin twenty

1:02:37.760,1:02:44.310
two-year-old in the back two and a half

1:02:40.920,1:02:46.860
somersaults like two and a half some

1:02:44.310,1:02:48.930
ourselves one and a half twist lots of

1:02:46.860,1:02:52.470
the the girls will be finishing on this

1:02:48.930,1:02:54.720
dive you'll see this dive from a lot of

1:02:52.470,1:02:56.430
the competitors in the last round here

1:02:54.720,1:02:58.710
maria Epting to use this one as their

1:02:56.430,1:03:00.810
fourth round dive and unfortunate for

1:02:58.710,1:03:02.460
her not working very well today entering

1:03:00.810,1:03:04.140
the water short there you can see the

1:03:02.460,1:03:06.840
splash being thrown back towards the

1:03:04.140,1:03:08.640
diving board have a look at the strain

1:03:06.840,1:03:12.030
on the face of the divers is they're

1:03:08.640,1:03:14.010
battling against gravity and different

1:03:12.030,1:03:14.790
forces trying to pull them in different

1:03:14.010,1:03:18.240
directions

1:03:14.790,1:03:20.490
all in fractions of seconds incredible

1:03:18.240,1:03:23.490
kind of mark fifty two point eight zero

1:03:20.490,1:03:25.650
and I'm afraid her chances of coming

1:03:23.490,1:03:32.160
back tonight look very remote at this

1:03:25.650,1:03:34.230
stage Kim Jin okay time to do the arm

1:03:32.160,1:03:35.520
stand slightly different one this to

1:03:34.230,1:03:37.170
remember this one yesterday Bob this is

1:03:35.520,1:03:38.520
one where she placed her nose on the end

1:03:37.170,1:03:43.610
of the platform or diff she's going to

1:03:38.520,1:03:46.230
do the same again three point one

1:03:43.610,1:03:48.720
forward double somersault one twist see

1:03:46.230,1:03:51.360
how close she gets today yeah right on

1:03:48.720,1:03:52.920
it again yes she just well the

1:03:51.360,1:03:55.350
interesting techniques you're most

1:03:52.920,1:03:56.760
places heard knows what she does place

1:03:55.350,1:03:57.810
her nose on the towel on the end of the

1:03:56.760,1:04:01.410
platform

1:03:57.810,1:04:02.940
and then flicks forward with the with

1:04:01.410,1:04:05.160
the legs in order to generate the

1:04:02.940,1:04:07.110
forward rotation in order to then come

1:04:05.160,1:04:09.390
out of the Ford rotation into the twist

1:04:07.110,1:04:12.000
and then into the Pike shape such a

1:04:09.390,1:04:12.810
challenging guide and an interesting

1:04:12.000,1:04:15.960
here we go

1:04:12.810,1:04:20.070
Oh forehead on the board like a head

1:04:15.960,1:04:21.270
spring in gymnastics no wonder she has a

1:04:20.070,1:04:24.000
towel there that can't be very pleasant

1:04:21.270,1:04:25.710
at all we are seeing some different

1:04:24.000,1:04:27.810
techniques aren't we some very

1:04:25.710,1:04:31.200
individual interpretations of some of

1:04:27.810,1:04:34.110
these dives and in her case it produces

1:04:31.200,1:04:36.480
a sixty five point one zero seven across

1:04:34.110,1:04:39.120
the board multiplied by the degree of

1:04:36.480,1:04:40.590
difficulty as I arrive with the marked

1:04:39.120,1:04:42.870
remember those marks with lines through

1:04:40.590,1:04:46.530
do not count are the ones that don't

1:04:42.870,1:04:48.570
have lines through do now Brittany viola

1:04:46.530,1:04:49.890
your chance to step up here and it's not

1:04:48.570,1:04:53.040
a dive that's gonna help you do it

1:04:49.890,1:04:57.030
greatly two point nine lower tariffs

1:04:53.040,1:04:58.830
back two and a half or yeah you see a

1:04:57.030,1:05:00.300
lot of squash being thrown up and spot

1:04:58.830,1:05:02.430
mentioned two point nine puts the

1:05:00.300,1:05:06.150
pressure on the diver to really execute

1:05:02.430,1:05:09.360
the die superb Lee well in Brittany well

1:05:06.150,1:05:11.220
she does a good job here all looks good

1:05:09.360,1:05:13.380
so far all she needed was to disappear

1:05:11.220,1:05:15.390
and instead she just tips a little bit

1:05:13.380,1:05:17.940
over throwing up quite a bit of splash I

1:05:15.390,1:05:20.190
don't think we're gonna see viola

1:05:17.940,1:05:22.950
progressing unless of course she can do

1:05:20.190,1:05:24.210
an eye on perfect last round i but

1:05:22.950,1:05:27.000
anyway anything can happen in this

1:05:24.210,1:05:29.100
competition already so let me get ahead

1:05:27.000,1:05:30.710
of myself in fact i'm gonna take back my

1:05:29.100,1:05:33.390
last statement and let's wait and see

1:05:30.710,1:05:35.430
fifty two point two zero i'm really not

1:05:33.390,1:05:37.170
what sure quite what to say about the

1:05:35.430,1:05:39.030
next competitor kids whatever i say has

1:05:37.170,1:05:42.660
an adverse effect on her performance so

1:05:39.030,1:05:46.640
all I would say is here's our Espinoza

1:05:42.660,1:05:46.640
Sanchez in with three and a half

1:05:58.960,1:06:04.070
well I think she dives so much better

1:06:01.490,1:06:05.570
when you just keep quiet Bob so I'm not

1:06:04.070,1:06:07.670
sure what to make of that

1:06:05.570,1:06:10.310
but Paulo is in 15th laughter the third

1:06:07.670,1:06:12.230
round this is much more like it this is

1:06:10.310,1:06:13.880
how we're used to seeing your dive and

1:06:12.230,1:06:15.740
this still could be better but I'm just

1:06:13.880,1:06:18.109
gonna let that go and say that's great

1:06:15.740,1:06:20.630
it'll get seven and a half and normally

1:06:18.109,1:06:22.190
more custom ter eight and eight point

1:06:20.630,1:06:24.500
five s and upwards but a little bit over

1:06:22.190,1:06:27.500
four for that so here we are 7.5 s as

1:06:24.500,1:06:29.810
predicted 72 needs to be better to make

1:06:27.500,1:06:34.970
that comeback though she does do it best

1:06:29.810,1:06:39.349
when I say nothing at all mg no e bat

1:06:34.970,1:06:42.710
key or Italy formally are hungrier so

1:06:39.349,1:06:44.090
she was born in Budapest and she will go

1:06:42.710,1:06:46.340
with an inward three and a half

1:06:44.090,1:06:50.270
somersaults we're tuck three point two

1:06:46.340,1:06:52.130
hurry in 13th place so looking out for

1:06:50.270,1:06:55.190
yourself get this right she could leap a

1:06:52.130,1:07:01.609
place or two and be back for the final

1:06:55.190,1:07:06.650
oh yeah that's certainly going to help

1:07:01.609,1:07:09.500
her campaign just on the cusp 13 and 3.2

1:07:06.650,1:07:11.390
big degree of difficulty and she's got a

1:07:09.500,1:07:13.220
low degree of difficulty to finish on so

1:07:11.390,1:07:15.230
she knows that pressure was on this dive

1:07:13.220,1:07:16.760
her fourth of iron dive you've seen this

1:07:15.230,1:07:19.010
a few times before this is the inward

1:07:16.760,1:07:22.220
three and a half and that's gonna get

1:07:19.010,1:07:24.320
mid-70s and if it does really strong

1:07:22.220,1:07:26.420
charts provided she nails a last dive of

1:07:24.320,1:07:29.270
going through which would be a superb

1:07:26.420,1:07:31.400
achievement for Naomi there are a lot of

1:07:29.270,1:07:33.170
provisos today as you noted a lot of

1:07:31.400,1:07:36.230
caveats from our seventy six point eight

1:07:33.170,1:07:38.690
zero eight across the board seventy six

1:07:36.230,1:07:44.780
point eight zero that's very nice work

1:07:38.690,1:07:48.109
by Naomi up into second he only ate for

1:07:44.780,1:07:50.630
a Gottschalk of Ukraine we'll see you

1:07:48.109,1:07:53.599
love the fourth round dives being armed

1:07:50.630,1:07:57.320
stance here comes another and it is the

1:07:53.599,1:07:58.130
very highest tariff 3.32 problems with

1:07:57.320,1:08:01.450
this last night

1:07:58.130,1:08:01.450
I'm stand back triple

1:08:02.840,1:08:08.010
well it's such a shame really because

1:08:04.890,1:08:11.550
the take-off was superb the rotation was

1:08:08.010,1:08:13.110
fast enough and then maybe she just fell

1:08:11.550,1:08:14.910
asleep halfway through because she

1:08:13.110,1:08:16.890
wasn't ready to come out of the dive and

1:08:14.910,1:08:18.960
then comes out way too late over she

1:08:16.890,1:08:21.270
goes that's gonna get five and a half

1:08:18.960,1:08:24.120
six sixes I think she's got enough of a

1:08:21.270,1:08:26.609
buffer to keep herself in contention to

1:08:24.120,1:08:30.600
qualify as you have to do some work on

1:08:26.609,1:08:32.370
that this afternoon before the final but

1:08:30.600,1:08:34.620
this young lady's done very well this

1:08:32.370,1:08:37.170
morning some of them haven't that julia

1:08:34.620,1:08:39.450
has strong starts just a knee off over

1:08:37.170,1:08:41.850
here 56 followed by fifty four point

1:08:39.450,1:08:44.250
four five four Prague up shook but she's

1:08:41.850,1:08:45.990
up into fourth place for the time being

1:08:44.250,1:08:48.569
and that should at the moment be good

1:08:45.990,1:08:53.069
enough to see her through this one more

1:08:48.569,1:08:55.049
round still to go stand I'm and again a

1:08:53.069,1:08:57.779
three point three exactly the same arm

1:08:55.049,1:09:00.870
stand back triple somersault for Megan

1:08:57.779,1:09:03.660
Ben Peter having a much better semi file

1:09:00.870,1:09:05.790
than the preliminary and fourth in

1:09:03.660,1:09:14.520
Shanghai fourth in Rome how much was she

1:09:05.790,1:09:16.980
like to go one better in London yep well

1:09:14.520,1:09:19.620
I'm sure well the thing is people need

1:09:16.980,1:09:21.270
to to make their way through safely to

1:09:19.620,1:09:24.450
the final then you can start to turn it

1:09:21.270,1:09:27.029
on Megan it's being consistent and

1:09:24.450,1:09:28.770
that's all she needs to do for the top

1:09:27.029,1:09:31.020
of the field so far still some divers

1:09:28.770,1:09:32.880
still to come this is it three point

1:09:31.020,1:09:34.980
three she gets into a really good tuck

1:09:32.880,1:09:37.740
shape just a little bit over as she goes

1:09:34.980,1:09:41.819
into the water so the judges will give

1:09:37.740,1:09:45.150
her seven yeah seven is gross aboard

1:09:41.819,1:09:47.339
sixty 9.30 for the marks account

1:09:45.150,1:09:49.109
I'm gonna miss Katie Belanger to make

1:09:47.339,1:09:51.089
the final and looks like she's not going

1:09:49.109,1:09:55.080
to the way things are saying but she has

1:09:51.089,1:09:58.310
two more rounds she can as Leon often

1:09:55.080,1:10:02.490
says land on her head which is a good

1:09:58.310,1:10:04.140
ceremony a good expression and she could

1:10:02.490,1:10:05.940
be back but she's got some ground to

1:10:04.140,1:10:07.890
make up

1:10:05.940,1:10:09.390
smile seems have disappeared to

1:10:07.890,1:10:11.190
concentration still there though back

1:10:09.390,1:10:18.150
three and a half somersault with a

1:10:11.190,1:10:20.070
counting on a three point three I think

1:10:18.150,1:10:23.280
it might be all over for Katie Bell what

1:10:20.070,1:10:25.170
a shame because yeah it's poor first two

1:10:23.280,1:10:27.330
dies in the preliminaries and then three

1:10:25.170,1:10:30.030
blistering dies to finish earn to this

1:10:27.330,1:10:31.560
spot comfortably and now this is her

1:10:30.030,1:10:34.020
biggest I've three point three just

1:10:31.560,1:10:37.740
turning into banana woman as she goes in

1:10:34.020,1:10:39.360
their lower back arch look at the strain

1:10:37.740,1:10:41.790
through all the body in order to

1:10:39.360,1:10:43.740
generate the rotation it even looks very

1:10:41.790,1:10:46.020
quick in slow-motion you really know how

1:10:43.740,1:10:47.670
quickly these divers are moving loose as

1:10:46.020,1:10:50.250
she goes into the water the impression

1:10:47.670,1:10:51.930
of a banana and oh the judges world

1:10:50.250,1:10:53.400
mixed bag five and a half to six and a

1:10:51.930,1:10:55.050
half so she's actually got away with

1:10:53.400,1:10:57.510
that I think subconsciously you're

1:10:55.050,1:11:02.910
putting forward some pilot ideas to TV

1:10:57.510,1:11:05.100
producers here banana man would he would

1:11:02.910,1:11:09.120
he win by the skin of his teeth his

1:11:05.100,1:11:12.150
Nakagawa reverse two and a half Wow

1:11:09.120,1:11:14.850
Nakagawa is just gone unfortunately from

1:11:12.150,1:11:16.830
bad to worse for her you know an

1:11:14.850,1:11:18.630
unsteady start hitting her feet on the

1:11:16.830,1:11:24.360
platform and then since then it's just

1:11:18.630,1:11:26.340
been a shambles for it hasn't so we've

1:11:24.360,1:11:28.410
seen it in a couple of a couple of times

1:11:26.340,1:11:31.080
where divers lose the plot and we're

1:11:28.410,1:11:34.590
seeing here with mid nakagawa just can't

1:11:31.080,1:11:36.420
find to her flow at all today it's one

1:11:34.590,1:11:38.760
more dive to go such a shame I expected

1:11:36.420,1:11:43.140
this young lady my to be in the final

1:11:38.760,1:11:46.560
but no final four Nakagawa today doesn't

1:11:43.140,1:11:48.390
know like it does a 18 place and tailed

1:11:46.560,1:11:50.490
off at the back of the field

1:11:48.390,1:11:53.490
so it's the best that she will be able

1:11:50.490,1:11:58.530
to achieve in London not the same for

1:11:53.490,1:12:00.210
yulia colton over fourth place they come

1:11:58.530,1:12:01.830
to a three point two degree of

1:12:00.210,1:12:04.220
difficulty dive tuck position for the

1:12:01.830,1:12:06.530
end with three and a half

1:12:04.220,1:12:09.890
well this is the one that she bolted on

1:12:06.530,1:12:11.810
in the preliminaries yesterday evening

1:12:09.890,1:12:13.940
and it's much better job this morning in

1:12:11.810,1:12:15.920
the semifinals it's still not where it

1:12:13.940,1:12:17.180
needs to be she's a little bit low on

1:12:15.920,1:12:18.920
the water and then she kind of does a

1:12:17.180,1:12:20.420
double come out so she comes out from

1:12:18.920,1:12:22.700
the hips and then straightens her knees

1:12:20.420,1:12:25.190
it should all happen simultaneously so

1:12:22.700,1:12:27.260
the judges really penalized her in the

1:12:25.190,1:12:29.810
prelims for it but it was more apparent

1:12:27.260,1:12:31.460
than this one is actually okay so she

1:12:29.810,1:12:33.380
might get six and a half seven as if she

1:12:31.460,1:12:34.790
snaps out straightening through the

1:12:33.380,1:12:36.740
knees and the hips at the same time it

1:12:34.790,1:12:39.190
looks a lot neater and she'd probably

1:12:36.740,1:12:41.570
get AIDS but heard sevens today I

1:12:39.190,1:12:45.470
predict a look back at the scoreboard

1:12:41.570,1:12:48.350
tells her the 60 7.20 is her mark

1:12:45.470,1:12:50.960
sevens will count and yeah she's in the

1:12:48.350,1:12:56.210
comfort zone in second place we're still

1:12:50.960,1:13:01.390
a few to go who you dan and her back

1:12:56.210,1:13:01.390
three laughs somersaults 3.3 with tuck

1:13:03.340,1:13:10.190
wow what are we watching here now who

1:13:07.610,1:13:13.730
done certainly hasn't found her rhythm

1:13:10.190,1:13:15.830
or certainly hasn't found her terrific

1:13:13.730,1:13:18.530
diving that we're used to seeing I'm not

1:13:15.830,1:13:20.750
sure whether she's injured she know no

1:13:18.530,1:13:22.970
one's made any statements but she is

1:13:20.750,1:13:24.650
diving under par she was definitely

1:13:22.970,1:13:27.140
gonna make it through to the final no

1:13:24.650,1:13:29.210
doubt about that but those other medals

1:13:27.140,1:13:31.520
are wide opening if Paul Espinoza goes

1:13:29.210,1:13:34.340
out as well then we could be entering

1:13:31.520,1:13:37.400
the interesting top three yeah five

1:13:34.340,1:13:40.280
point five that's a rarity for Chinese

1:13:37.400,1:13:42.650
divers at any competition and she just

1:13:40.280,1:13:48.250
hasn't really got together 76 in the

1:13:42.650,1:13:53.210
previous dive was okay at 54 it's not

1:13:48.250,1:13:55.730
now melissa whoop of australia seventh

1:13:53.210,1:13:59.020
place with two more dives to come in

1:13:55.730,1:13:59.020
with three and a half we tuck

1:13:59.479,1:14:02.719
very good

1:14:06.110,1:14:11.659
very steady this morning formulas up in

1:14:10.369,1:14:13.670
with three and a half such good shape

1:14:11.659,1:14:15.199
sneezes together toes are pointed

1:14:13.670,1:14:16.880
bending at the hips and at the knees

1:14:15.199,1:14:19.820
little short she went in that'll go

1:14:16.880,1:14:20.809
seven and a half not quite upright

1:14:19.820,1:14:23.119
enough for an eight

1:14:20.809,1:14:25.849
look at that perfect shape in the air a

1:14:23.119,1:14:28.130
little bit sure does she went in but

1:14:25.849,1:14:30.980
very steady from whoop she'll be one of

1:14:28.130,1:14:33.110
our finalists looks very much like we

1:14:30.980,1:14:36.530
will have two Australians through to the

1:14:33.110,1:14:39.079
top twelve Lister we without 72 is

1:14:36.530,1:14:41.599
pretty much guaranteed her place she's

1:14:39.079,1:14:44.659
not been anywhere near as impressive

1:14:41.599,1:14:46.400
this young lady 16 years of age Brittany

1:14:44.659,1:14:53.389
bromans second place at the moment

1:14:46.400,1:14:55.250
here's her back three and a half well

1:14:53.389,1:14:57.260
that's where weakest I've so far but

1:14:55.250,1:15:00.829
she's a real class act this young lady I

1:14:57.260,1:15:03.619
am super impressed yep she knows she's

1:15:00.829,1:15:06.530
let the dive over rotate there but Wow

1:15:03.619,1:15:08.570
look at this jump double almost by board

1:15:06.530,1:15:10.579
level she's just out a little bit late

1:15:08.570,1:15:12.530
there if she was out earlier she would

1:15:10.579,1:15:15.170
have given herself chance just to bury

1:15:12.530,1:15:17.690
that entry it'll only get I don't know

1:15:15.170,1:15:19.400
five and a half maybe on that because

1:15:17.690,1:15:21.219
she is quite a way over vertical and

1:15:19.400,1:15:23.750
does go loose as she goes in however

1:15:21.219,1:15:25.699
three exceptional dives and one dive to

1:15:23.750,1:15:27.290
improve on she she's a medal in the

1:15:25.699,1:15:31.389
final I'm gonna go out on it to

1:15:27.290,1:15:33.739
definitely five point five and five

1:15:31.389,1:15:37.760
towards that total of fifty two point

1:15:33.739,1:15:41.989
eight zero just inched to make sure that

1:15:37.760,1:15:44.750
she's shaken a notch dirt here back two

1:15:41.989,1:15:48.710
and a half somersaults with Mike two

1:15:44.750,1:15:49.489
point nine degree of difficulty I was

1:15:48.710,1:15:51.320
about to come out with my

1:15:49.489,1:15:53.710
double-oh-seven gags but I think she's

1:15:51.320,1:15:56.510
gonna get even more than sevens on that

1:15:53.710,1:15:58.460
again opting for the slightly easier

1:15:56.510,1:15:59.840
dive so two point nine degree of

1:15:58.460,1:16:01.159
difficulty so it needed to be good it

1:15:59.840,1:16:02.389
was good in the prelims and I think

1:16:01.159,1:16:06.500
that's going to get a bag full of eight

1:16:02.389,1:16:11.719
for that effort so no double o7s for

1:16:06.500,1:16:13.250
Stewart coming out very early pulling

1:16:11.719,1:16:15.409
the dive Ryan she knows exactly where

1:16:13.250,1:16:16.969
she is very experienced being here in

1:16:15.409,1:16:18.349
many times his real last Olympic Games

1:16:16.969,1:16:19.980
at the age of twenty nine and she's

1:16:18.349,1:16:21.870
securing her berth in the final

1:16:19.980,1:16:25.170
dive after dive while she goes

1:16:21.870,1:16:27.570
contemplating another five dives in the

1:16:25.170,1:16:36.510
final later today sixty nine point six

1:16:27.570,1:16:42.140
zero four on to and pang the penultimate

1:16:36.510,1:16:42.140
diver in round four already sixth

1:16:42.410,1:16:46.920
turning 13 achieved so far just gonna

1:16:45.570,1:16:48.570
have to hurt Ali with this inward

1:16:46.920,1:16:53.610
three-and-a-half sever sorts

1:16:48.570,1:16:56.310
we're tuck a little bit weaker for Penn

1:16:53.610,1:16:58.650
develop just I think and lacking a

1:16:56.310,1:17:00.450
little bit of confidence on that she's

1:16:58.650,1:17:02.160
been attacking her dives and maybe

1:17:00.450,1:17:05.400
losing control of some of them so this

1:17:02.160,1:17:07.440
one she tried to play safe so all looks

1:17:05.400,1:17:09.480
okay so far and then she comes out to

1:17:07.440,1:17:11.880
get all oh I've got less time than I

1:17:09.480,1:17:14.370
fought just enters the water to a touch

1:17:11.880,1:17:19.100
short of vertical it won't affect her

1:17:14.370,1:17:21.720
getting through to the final lower

1:17:19.100,1:17:24.200
standard than she would have hoped maybe

1:17:21.720,1:17:27.300
she can step up a gear for the final

1:17:24.200,1:17:29.370
yeah not quite confirm yet cuz we have

1:17:27.300,1:17:31.230
one more round to go and anything it

1:17:29.370,1:17:34.080
happens we saw in the men's three meter

1:17:31.230,1:17:36.420
the other day but within sight within

1:17:34.080,1:17:40.290
touching distance of a place in the

1:17:36.420,1:17:42.620
final say class that's not quite sure

1:17:40.290,1:17:46.200
which other way to describe Chen Ruolin

1:17:42.620,1:17:47.400
but she is in a different league when

1:17:46.200,1:17:49.290
she's diving like she has been the last

1:17:47.400,1:17:54.300
two days back three and a half last dive

1:17:49.290,1:17:58.230
around there before yep she certainly is

1:17:54.300,1:18:00.810
a cut above know when challenging Chen

1:17:58.230,1:18:03.690
yesterday or today she's having it all

1:18:00.810,1:18:05.730
of own way but it doesn't really matter

1:18:03.690,1:18:07.760
this is an exceptional dive it'll go way

1:18:05.730,1:18:10.350
over 80 points is three point three

1:18:07.760,1:18:12.330
super but of course the semi-final

1:18:10.350,1:18:15.180
scores do not carry through to the final

1:18:12.330,1:18:18.150
so Chinese actually just doing a diving

1:18:15.180,1:18:21.210
display here and everyone starts at zero

1:18:18.150,1:18:24.719
at 7:00 p.m. tonight when am I tell you

1:18:21.210,1:18:26.489
she has a gap of 39 points over the rest

1:18:24.719,1:18:28.710
kinda shows you she is a different

1:18:26.489,1:18:32.579
competition altogether it's her against

1:18:28.710,1:18:36.780
the rest really and the rest of not

1:18:32.579,1:18:38.719
making any inroads on her ways of

1:18:36.780,1:18:41.999
preparing for round five

1:18:38.719,1:18:46.409
here is the standings at the end of

1:18:41.999,1:18:50.969
Round four China Canada Australia in

1:18:46.409,1:18:53.489
Ruolin been Fito and rohban and down to

1:18:50.969,1:18:56.070
nine filly on should be okay let's see

1:18:53.489,1:19:01.800
the margin between ninth and twelfth 260

1:18:56.070,1:19:03.380
plays 247 so should be enough margin for

1:19:01.800,1:19:07.820
error built in but we are going to lose

1:19:03.380,1:19:13.619
kim sanchez bowler bell hooyo and

1:19:07.820,1:19:16.079
Nakagawa well let's wait and see if

1:19:13.619,1:19:17.909
Paolo Espinosa comes out with a superb

1:19:16.079,1:19:20.369
last hour she is in within striking

1:19:17.909,1:19:25.320
distance of scraping through or to play

1:19:20.369,1:19:27.150
four on those minor places attention the

1:19:25.320,1:19:28.590
word that's often used may be overused

1:19:27.150,1:19:31.619
in sport a lot of pressure

1:19:28.590,1:19:35.429
certainly on those around the 13 14 15

1:19:31.619,1:19:39.119
mark to up their game including the

1:19:35.429,1:19:44.030
opening diver in round five 13th place

1:19:39.119,1:19:46.409
at the moment for kim eunhaeng

1:19:44.030,1:19:49.619
know cuz she finished with a flourish

1:19:46.409,1:19:52.769
back two and a half somersaults one half

1:19:49.619,1:19:55.979
twist three point to get this right and

1:19:52.769,1:20:00.269
she might be in contention for a return

1:19:55.979,1:20:01.920
in the final well get used to this dive

1:20:00.269,1:20:04.860
you're going to be seeing a lot of the

1:20:01.920,1:20:06.479
ladies using this as their final dive

1:20:04.860,1:20:08.880
the reason being is three point two

1:20:06.479,1:20:12.059
degree of difficulty and it's actually

1:20:08.880,1:20:13.260
quite easy for a three point two so even

1:20:12.059,1:20:14.550
though the degree of difficulty is the

1:20:13.260,1:20:16.710
same as some of the times we've seen

1:20:14.550,1:20:19.699
before because of this particular

1:20:16.710,1:20:23.039
technique of dive or this style of dive

1:20:19.699,1:20:24.179
one and a half twist into the Pike shape

1:20:23.039,1:20:26.219
and you can actually see where you're

1:20:24.179,1:20:27.510
going and you're in a pike position so

1:20:26.219,1:20:28.820
you look over the end of your toes and

1:20:27.510,1:20:32.519
line up into the water

1:20:28.820,1:20:34.920
seven seven point five yep seven point

1:20:32.519,1:20:36.790
five s mainly all seven point five Tsar

1:20:34.920,1:20:40.270
the ones that count anyway

1:20:36.790,1:20:41.530
72 is her final mark now she just have

1:20:40.270,1:20:45.240
to sit and wait

1:20:41.530,1:20:50.500
I see where that will be good enough

1:20:45.240,1:20:53.770
Roslyn Feeny on our Canada in Montreal

1:20:50.500,1:20:56.200
the world champ ship sin mm of 5/4 in

1:20:53.770,1:20:59.230
Rome 7th in Shanghai very consistent

1:20:56.200,1:21:00.910
performer and here it comes again back

1:20:59.230,1:21:01.740
to a half somersaults one the half

1:21:00.910,1:21:05.770
twists

1:21:01.740,1:21:08.200
yep consistency is key and certainly is

1:21:05.770,1:21:09.700
the case for Rosaline a little bit off

1:21:08.200,1:21:11.770
her game last night and again this

1:21:09.700,1:21:12.550
morning if I'm honest but still coming

1:21:11.770,1:21:14.680
through in the end

1:21:12.550,1:21:16.660
moved herself up to ninth after four

1:21:14.680,1:21:18.040
rounds and I think she'll finish the

1:21:16.660,1:21:20.380
round about that spot here in the

1:21:18.040,1:21:24.040
semi-finals securing her berth in the

1:21:20.380,1:21:26.140
final good final dive easy to compare

1:21:24.040,1:21:30.780
like-for-like with Kim just before her

1:21:26.140,1:21:33.280
probably marginally better yeah

1:21:30.780,1:21:34.960
sixty-eight point eight zero it's all

1:21:33.280,1:21:36.640
down to the judges interpretation and

1:21:34.960,1:21:39.580
where some 7.5 s on there but they just

1:21:36.640,1:21:40.390
didn't count towards total and yeah

1:21:39.580,1:21:43.300
she's fine

1:21:40.390,1:21:45.730
coach happy she'll be row to be happy

1:21:43.300,1:21:49.240
baseball in his hand yes to calm his

1:21:45.730,1:21:51.550
nerves nervous for the coaches as well

1:21:49.240,1:21:53.560
so he does start with the with the

1:21:51.550,1:21:56.800
baseball just stopped himself going a

1:21:53.560,1:22:00.700
bit stir-crazy Maria Carey oh that's too

1:21:56.800,1:22:03.970
much to do surely now yep too much to do

1:22:00.700,1:22:05.560
low degree of difficulty to finish at

1:22:03.970,1:22:07.510
first Olympic Games as she made it

1:22:05.560,1:22:09.970
through to the semifinals when lots of

1:22:07.510,1:22:11.920
the big names were faltering she managed

1:22:09.970,1:22:14.500
to stay steady enough last night to make

1:22:11.920,1:22:17.260
it through just entering the water short

1:22:14.500,1:22:21.150
here and it's the sevens across the

1:22:17.260,1:22:26.310
board finish you see the judges they're

1:22:21.150,1:22:26.310
studying the divers she accelerates by

1:22:26.850,1:22:30.790
drop-down cameras preys on the water

1:22:29.290,1:22:32.560
there to disturb the surface so the

1:22:30.790,1:22:36.700
divers can see exactly where the surface

1:22:32.560,1:22:40.600
of the water is it's a lot to think

1:22:36.700,1:22:42.790
about yeah as she walks away and there's

1:22:40.600,1:22:46.480
what you might do with the rest of today

1:22:42.790,1:22:48.960
and indeed tomorrow it's not gonna be on

1:22:46.480,1:22:52.720
the diving board for her

1:22:48.960,1:22:57.070
Kim Jin Mok in 11th place

1:22:52.720,1:23:01.720
coach watches on my name she makes a

1:22:57.070,1:23:03.610
reasonable attempt at this she won't be

1:23:01.720,1:23:06.340
back tonight back two and a half

1:23:03.610,1:23:10.510
somersaults one and a half twists in the

1:23:06.340,1:23:12.220
pike position whoa

1:23:10.510,1:23:14.860
now she was hit 11th after the fourth

1:23:12.220,1:23:17.320
round splitting the dive go over as she

1:23:14.860,1:23:19.150
went in again you'll see a lot of the

1:23:17.320,1:23:21.640
girls finishing on this dive it's three

1:23:19.150,1:23:23.950
point two so when it's like four like

1:23:21.640,1:23:26.170
it's a battle of the execution and that

1:23:23.950,1:23:28.570
is just slightly off you can see the

1:23:26.170,1:23:31.330
diver over rotating net six-and-a-half

1:23:28.570,1:23:34.660
sevens probably did she have enough of a

1:23:31.330,1:23:36.220
buffer to secure her spot in the final

1:23:34.660,1:23:38.110
she'll have an agonizing wait yeah I'm

1:23:36.220,1:23:39.280
not sure that's gonna be quite good

1:23:38.110,1:23:42.460
enough it's gonna be right on the

1:23:39.280,1:23:44.320
margins sixty five point six zero and we

1:23:42.460,1:23:46.690
have a computer screen alongside us it

1:23:44.320,1:23:48.880
shows the qualifiers nobody yet has

1:23:46.690,1:23:51.670
qualified we don't have the big keel on

1:23:48.880,1:23:53.070
our scoreboard as they come in we will

1:23:51.670,1:23:57.070
give them to you

1:23:53.070,1:23:58.990
fifteenth place now could she finish

1:23:57.070,1:24:02.260
with her best dive what she's going to

1:23:58.990,1:24:04.780
need to do now any chance of making the

1:24:02.260,1:24:07.600
top 12 15th at the moment for brittany

1:24:04.780,1:24:10.090
viola hasn't replicated what she did in

1:24:07.600,1:24:13.260
the prelims so far back two and a half

1:24:10.090,1:24:16.690
somersaults 1r twists

1:24:13.260,1:24:19.480
well she's giving it a good go that's

1:24:16.690,1:24:22.630
what's probably her best dive today mum

1:24:19.480,1:24:24.340
and dad supporting it as always I'm sure

1:24:22.630,1:24:26.770
many people behind her here made the

1:24:24.340,1:24:28.270
trip to London anyway trying to finish

1:24:26.770,1:24:29.740
with the flourish here I don't think

1:24:28.270,1:24:31.780
that's going to be good enough it's only

1:24:29.740,1:24:35.860
going to get 7 to 7 point 5 s but she

1:24:31.780,1:24:39.130
would have really needed nines to to get

1:24:35.860,1:24:42.130
a total worthy enough in this field to

1:24:39.130,1:24:43.780
get into the final such a shame expected

1:24:42.130,1:24:46.390
to see viola go through this morning

1:24:43.780,1:24:47.920
goes to show what can happen it looks

1:24:46.390,1:24:49.930
like both Americans are going to go out

1:24:47.920,1:24:51.619
here which is a bit of a surprise 70

1:24:49.930,1:24:55.239
point 4 0

1:24:51.619,1:25:02.209
and her race I'm afraid looks to be run

1:24:55.239,1:25:05.780
now hmm okay you keep quiet Bob RT this

1:25:02.209,1:25:10.969
one up this is Paola Espinosa finishing

1:25:05.780,1:25:13.659
her final dive in 14th World

1:25:10.969,1:25:13.659
Championship

1:25:15.219,1:25:20.780
Wow has she done enough when it counts I

1:25:18.469,1:25:23.329
think she has yeah

1:25:20.780,1:25:25.340
relief from the coaches she has had a

1:25:23.329,1:25:27.320
tough day out there today hasn't nailed

1:25:25.340,1:25:29.239
any of her dives her fourth line dive

1:25:27.320,1:25:31.610
was our best one and this one is of

1:25:29.239,1:25:36.199
equal standard that should get 8 little

1:25:31.610,1:25:38.959
bit over as she went in 3.2 75 points or

1:25:36.199,1:25:42.260
there abouts it's no guarantee but I

1:25:38.959,1:25:44.149
think she might just scrape in grabbing

1:25:42.260,1:25:46.099
the hands to punch a hole in the water

1:25:44.149,1:25:47.840
look at that super slow-motion if she

1:25:46.099,1:25:50.929
goes in you can see there the feet just

1:25:47.840,1:25:52.729
tipping over a vertical there yeah I

1:25:50.929,1:25:54.709
didn't want to be powerless sword of

1:25:52.729,1:25:56.179
Damocles today I'm quite glad I didn't

1:25:54.709,1:25:58.039
say anything before that dive because

1:25:56.179,1:26:00.169
she's performed her best of the day I

1:25:58.039,1:26:02.929
know what to do tonight now don't I

1:26:00.169,1:26:07.309
seventy six point eight zero and she is

1:26:02.929,1:26:10.999
up into third place Naomi backe has very

1:26:07.309,1:26:14.209
little room for error here this needs to

1:26:10.999,1:26:18.139
be spot on reverse two and a half oh and

1:26:14.209,1:26:20.479
it is two spot on right on the money two

1:26:18.139,1:26:23.629
point seven degree of difficulty point

1:26:20.479,1:26:27.379
five lower than Espinosa and Faiola and

1:26:23.629,1:26:29.689
Kim so it needed to be bang on the money

1:26:27.379,1:26:31.789
it's difficult to get higher than 65

1:26:29.689,1:26:33.739
points or less of course you nail it

1:26:31.789,1:26:35.090
like nobody's done there she could

1:26:33.739,1:26:37.070
probably get eighth in the house for

1:26:35.090,1:26:38.209
that well she certainly deserves eight

1:26:37.070,1:26:39.919
in a house let's see what the judges

1:26:38.209,1:26:41.539
think there we are look at those wrist

1:26:39.919,1:26:47.119
supports that hands grab together

1:26:41.539,1:26:50.149
entering the water sixty eight point

1:26:47.119,1:26:52.459
eight five for backe and that has put

1:26:50.149,1:26:55.969
her in a really good place in terms of

1:26:52.459,1:26:57.889
progression first of the qualifying two

1:26:55.969,1:27:02.149
is Rosalie and phillium she cannot be

1:26:57.889,1:27:04.250
overtaken by 12 other divers so she's

1:27:02.149,1:27:09.140
made it through nobody else as yet

1:27:04.250,1:27:12.350
earlier Ragab Chuck oh it needed to be

1:27:09.140,1:27:13.790
good from you Leah started off very well

1:27:12.350,1:27:15.680
and then had a little bit of a wobble

1:27:13.790,1:27:17.570
and then she's come back with a strong

1:27:15.680,1:27:20.120
finishing 12th after the first four

1:27:17.570,1:27:22.580
rounds again saving this one until last

1:27:20.120,1:27:24.860
you've seen it before it's 3.2 it's the

1:27:22.580,1:27:27.110
twisty whirly whirly one and it works

1:27:24.860,1:27:30.640
for it that's going to get well over 65

1:27:27.110,1:27:35.510
points quite as good as Paul Espinoza

1:27:30.640,1:27:36.860
she gets around the 310 mark maybe yeah

1:27:35.510,1:27:40.700
then I think that'll be good enough for

1:27:36.860,1:27:42.530
the final toffee covered in chocolate

1:27:40.700,1:27:45.440
where they just II really really hmm

1:27:42.530,1:27:49.310
sixty-eight point eight zero for pro got

1:27:45.440,1:27:57.320
Chuck and she might be back Chuck later

1:27:49.310,1:27:59.510
on today on - Megan Ben Fito of Canada

1:27:57.320,1:28:02.060
back two and a half somersaults one and

1:27:59.510,1:28:06.260
a half twists she has moved up the

1:28:02.060,1:28:10.130
rankings and there's second place it's

1:28:06.260,1:28:13.070
been a good progression by Megan and

1:28:10.130,1:28:14.690
there is that much favored last round

1:28:13.070,1:28:18.890
over the back two and a half of one half

1:28:14.690,1:28:21.680
twists our finishes off in style that's

1:28:18.890,1:28:25.550
two Canadians through to this woman's 10

1:28:21.680,1:28:29.600
metre platform final later on today 7:00

1:28:25.550,1:28:31.850
p.m. local time already Olympic bronze

1:28:29.600,1:28:34.910
medalist last week with her partner

1:28:31.850,1:28:39.790
Rosalynn fee on both Rosaleen and Megan

1:28:34.910,1:28:43.100
through to the final superb last dive

1:28:39.790,1:28:47.570
and probably good enough to earn her

1:28:43.100,1:28:50.630
second behind Chen when Fito through

1:28:47.570,1:28:54.590
finis on through that key through all

1:28:50.630,1:28:56.030
with queues beside their names they can

1:28:54.590,1:29:02.900
join the queue and the net mind on this

1:28:56.030,1:29:04.310
occasion Katie Bell may I see her bang

1:29:02.900,1:29:07.190
out of the competition as she were never

1:29:04.310,1:29:10.400
to be will do now back to an hour

1:29:07.190,1:29:11.690
somersaults one and a half twists one

1:29:10.400,1:29:14.080
more time for old times sake the

1:29:11.690,1:29:14.080
counting

1:29:22.130,1:29:27.950
oh it's a good time to finish on just

1:29:25.730,1:29:31.610
arching through her back if she goes

1:29:27.950,1:29:34.100
into the water going over in over as she

1:29:31.610,1:29:36.260
enters here we go wrapping the arms into

1:29:34.100,1:29:38.870
the one and a half twist folding into

1:29:36.260,1:29:40.280
the pike shape squeezing in just arching

1:29:38.870,1:29:41.660
through a lo about there giving the

1:29:40.280,1:29:43.910
impression that divert is a little bit

1:29:41.660,1:29:45.230
more untidy it's a good time to finish

1:29:43.910,1:29:47.600
but that will not be good enough to

1:29:45.230,1:29:51.650
break 300 and certainly not good enough

1:29:47.600,1:29:55.850
to go through to the final that's it for

1:29:51.650,1:29:59.690
her no more which gives her a hug

1:29:55.850,1:30:08.450
consoling Pat I'm not sure his name is

1:29:59.690,1:30:10.130
Pat Burton Anton Nakagawa of Japan back

1:30:08.450,1:30:13.520
two and a half somersaults one and a

1:30:10.130,1:30:20.900
half twist three point two great 18th is

1:30:13.520,1:30:22.670
unlikely to be where she fishes up or

1:30:20.900,1:30:25.580
she's finished with a good one I'm so

1:30:22.670,1:30:28.940
pleased for Nakagawa this young lady is

1:30:25.580,1:30:31.130
a fantastic diver showing what she can

1:30:28.940,1:30:34.310
do in the prelims but unfortunately an

1:30:31.130,1:30:35.810
unsteady start to her semi-final meant

1:30:34.310,1:30:38.360
that the wheels came off and they

1:30:35.810,1:30:39.920
tumbled down the road but she's managed

1:30:38.360,1:30:44.000
to put them back on the vehicle now

1:30:39.920,1:30:47.570
nails her last dive but way too much to

1:30:44.000,1:30:51.230
do and that's a shame for my she'll be

1:30:47.570,1:30:51.650
back 25 years old will she stay on till

1:30:51.230,1:30:53.960
Rio

1:30:51.650,1:30:55.850
how does she finish seventy five point

1:30:53.960,1:30:57.230
two zero she'll be thinking honey I

1:30:55.850,1:30:59.870
could have done that more consistently

1:30:57.230,1:31:02.870
then I will be thinking about a top 12

1:30:59.870,1:31:07.370
place as it is 18th is where she will

1:31:02.870,1:31:10.250
finish Julia Colt Innova has to be a

1:31:07.370,1:31:13.040
medal contender if she continues with

1:31:10.250,1:31:16.190
this good consistent form she's shown

1:31:13.040,1:31:17.900
over the first two competitions it comes

1:31:16.190,1:31:21.230
to back two and a half

1:31:17.900,1:31:23.000
yet very consistent from Yuliya that

1:31:21.230,1:31:26.120
she's up to gain from the semies and I

1:31:23.000,1:31:27.950
think she'll be a top-five finish which

1:31:26.120,1:31:29.810
is very impressive from this young lady

1:31:27.950,1:31:32.320
one and a half twist you know this into

1:31:29.810,1:31:34.430
the pike shape beautiful toe point

1:31:32.320,1:31:36.530
little short she went in there just

1:31:34.430,1:31:38.030
stopping the dive a little bit early she

1:31:36.530,1:31:40.460
just needed to let it come round a

1:31:38.030,1:31:43.610
little bit more some improvements can be

1:31:40.460,1:31:45.530
made in between now and tonight maybe

1:31:43.610,1:31:48.350
she's saving the best to later inspired

1:31:45.530,1:31:50.810
by Ilya Zakharov standing at the top of

1:31:48.350,1:31:54.070
the podium Oney well how long ago was

1:31:50.810,1:31:57.290
that now not yesterday the day before

1:31:54.070,1:31:58.940
17.4 zero for Carlton over because I've

1:31:57.290,1:32:01.490
been feeling rather responsible for this

1:31:58.940,1:32:05.720
I'm so delighted to the Espinoza Sanchez

1:32:01.490,1:32:11.000
has made the final overslept tonight if

1:32:05.720,1:32:15.040
she hadn't on to who you'd am 16 year

1:32:11.000,1:32:15.040
old Chinese to finish off her program

1:32:15.140,1:32:22.310
oh she is all over the shop Wow Benny

1:32:20.420,1:32:24.290
was shambo's from heat and right from

1:32:22.310,1:32:26.420
the word go I'm not I'm perplexed as to

1:32:24.290,1:32:28.540
why this is actually happening this

1:32:26.420,1:32:31.730
young lady's on the Chinese team and

1:32:28.540,1:32:34.820
she's on the team for a reason and that

1:32:31.730,1:32:36.890
he's very under par one and a half twist

1:32:34.820,1:32:40.700
two and a half somersaults shorter she

1:32:36.890,1:32:44.630
goes in and very low score from who you

1:32:40.700,1:32:46.550
done she follows a 54 with a 56 she will

1:32:44.630,1:32:55.130
make the final than not very impressive

1:32:46.550,1:32:59.540
from who you Dan today now on - Melissa

1:32:55.130,1:33:01.820
Wu of Australia six place so provide

1:32:59.540,1:33:03.140
nothing goes terribly wrong on this

1:33:01.820,1:33:06.050
which we wouldn't wish on her of course

1:33:03.140,1:33:07.700
a back two and a half again with Mike

1:33:06.050,1:33:10.580
you've got used to this type right now

1:33:07.700,1:33:14.930
as she used to it can she finish with a

1:33:10.580,1:33:17.630
decent mark oh yes she can the best till

1:33:14.930,1:33:19.040
last but Melissa whoo he's been diving

1:33:17.630,1:33:21.590
steady in Matthew Mitchum there

1:33:19.040,1:33:24.700
whistling and cheering and cheering and

1:33:21.590,1:33:27.320
so he should be that's a fantastic dive

1:33:24.700,1:33:28.790
there we go lots of the girls finishing

1:33:27.320,1:33:32.090
on this one and Melissa whoo

1:33:28.790,1:33:34.910
showing her class securing her spot in

1:33:32.090,1:33:35.330
the ceilings final with eights I would

1:33:34.910,1:33:39.290
imagine

1:33:35.330,1:33:44.480
across the board well the marcsa got

1:33:39.290,1:33:48.590
gradually higher 64 69 72 and she rounds

1:33:44.480,1:33:50.270
off her bring out with a 70 6.80 lives

1:33:48.590,1:33:54.710
her up to second at the time being mind

1:33:50.270,1:33:56.450
bent feet oh and above colton over if

1:33:54.710,1:33:59.150
she's been impressive what do we say

1:33:56.450,1:34:02.030
about this young lady 16 years of age

1:33:59.150,1:34:03.950
Brittany Robin can opting to go for the

1:34:02.030,1:34:07.160
same dive the majority of divers have

1:34:03.950,1:34:11.410
gone for in the last round third and she

1:34:07.160,1:34:11.410
underlined her third place after this

1:34:12.340,1:34:19.900
well I picked you can easily expanding

1:34:16.000,1:34:21.790
diving from this young lady today the

1:34:19.900,1:34:24.700
support and this crowd very appreciative

1:34:21.790,1:34:27.820
of all the divers especially the ones

1:34:24.700,1:34:29.560
that are nailing their dives you become

1:34:27.820,1:34:31.420
an expert as the competition goes on

1:34:29.560,1:34:33.670
you're looking for the splash less entry

1:34:31.420,1:34:36.310
completely vertical and that's exactly

1:34:33.670,1:34:38.970
what this young lady delivers beautiful

1:34:36.310,1:34:41.410
diving and she is my tip for a medal

1:34:38.970,1:34:44.530
well see what the bookies say everywhere

1:34:41.410,1:34:48.580
slide from dive number four you know

1:34:44.530,1:34:50.950
it's been exemplary 71 81 76 and 76

1:34:48.580,1:34:53.590
again from Brittany bromanor she can get

1:34:50.950,1:34:56.200
round for assorted she is definitely in

1:34:53.590,1:34:57.550
with a great chance tonight an

1:34:56.200,1:35:01.200
Australian medal and they've been few

1:34:57.550,1:35:01.200
and far between us Olympics heavenly

1:35:01.410,1:35:07.390
Christian stir of Jeremy snipe variants

1:35:05.230,1:35:09.130
for us the dive that most people started

1:35:07.390,1:35:10.900
with in the first round forward three

1:35:09.130,1:35:15.610
and a half summer sorts with pike for

1:35:10.900,1:35:17.380
her to finish yeah not the best effort

1:35:15.610,1:35:19.210
for Kristine running out of room a

1:35:17.380,1:35:20.710
little bit and the takeoff do let it

1:35:19.210,1:35:23.290
down a little bit the entry into the

1:35:20.710,1:35:25.900
water is always very solid for her this

1:35:23.290,1:35:28.210
time however just a little bit loose as

1:35:25.900,1:35:29.890
she goes in not quite straightening out

1:35:28.210,1:35:31.210
completely throwing up a little bit of

1:35:29.890,1:35:34.330
splash it will still get seven and a

1:35:31.210,1:35:36.400
half's opting to use the towel it's just

1:35:34.330,1:35:38.680
a comfort thing the sprays on the water

1:35:36.400,1:35:40.990
showing he dives exactly where it is and

1:35:38.680,1:35:44.740
Strayer through to her Olympic final

1:35:40.990,1:35:47.650
yeah she's made it through and the

1:35:44.740,1:35:49.510
queues aside European out so the name

1:35:47.650,1:35:53.440
still waiting see if pre-op chip has

1:35:49.510,1:35:57.190
made it she hasn't yet got that Cuba

1:35:53.440,1:35:59.110
side here named but and a pang has done

1:35:57.190,1:36:01.030
all the good work early on so she

1:35:59.110,1:36:02.830
doesn't have a nervous last dive the

1:36:01.030,1:36:10.240
back two and a half somersaults one half

1:36:02.830,1:36:12.820
twists 3.2 yep it's tidy it's clean into

1:36:10.240,1:36:16.570
the water a little bit Rowley so she

1:36:12.820,1:36:18.730
doesn't quite straight now completely as

1:36:16.570,1:36:20.410
she enters the water so my opinion she's

1:36:18.730,1:36:23.119
giving it too much beans on the start

1:36:20.410,1:36:24.409
there cranks up the dive

1:36:23.119,1:36:27.050
and just doesn't quite control it

1:36:24.409,1:36:29.269
properly it'll get 7.5 s and she's

1:36:27.050,1:36:30.769
definitely in the final an interesting

1:36:29.269,1:36:32.539
enough trend reel in up next doesn't

1:36:30.769,1:36:34.760
even need to do a last dive

1:36:32.539,1:36:36.679
she's already qualified it's impressive

1:36:34.760,1:36:38.269
isn't it it is impressive and just shows

1:36:36.679,1:36:41.929
how far ahead of everybody else she is

1:36:38.269,1:36:45.619
7.5 in Pandora and that will mean that

1:36:41.929,1:36:48.199
she is fourth ranked to the final and

1:36:45.619,1:36:53.629
very happy to be there but nobody can

1:36:48.199,1:36:59.300
hold a candle to chain rule in she has

1:36:53.629,1:37:01.909
been absolutely mustard today back to

1:36:59.300,1:37:05.889
1/2 along with pretty much all the other

1:37:01.909,1:37:05.889
competitors in the last round to finish

1:37:06.639,1:37:11.570
well now you see me now you don't

1:37:09.079,1:37:15.079
generally disappearing into the water

1:37:11.570,1:37:16.550
and just outclassing this field quickly

1:37:15.079,1:37:19.309
bro bird looking on they're looking at

1:37:16.550,1:37:22.039
the scoreboard Jeremy Lin way over 400

1:37:19.309,1:37:24.199
points she'll probably be maybe even 50

1:37:22.039,1:37:27.679
points ahead of the rest of the field

1:37:24.199,1:37:30.079
and she is a class act what a set of

1:37:27.679,1:37:32.570
dives we've been treated to and it's her

1:37:30.079,1:37:34.820
gold this evening to throw away if she

1:37:32.570,1:37:35.209
chooses to do so and I don't think she

1:37:34.820,1:37:37.099
will

1:37:35.209,1:37:38.719
now what is the gap between her and the

1:37:37.099,1:37:43.760
rest we'll see in a moment eighty four

1:37:38.719,1:37:47.090
point eight zero nine 98.5 and that is a

1:37:43.760,1:37:50.659
tremendous way to finish she's never

1:37:47.090,1:37:53.449
been below 73 and in four rounds up

1:37:50.659,1:37:55.599
above 80 and though he's got even close

1:37:53.449,1:37:59.659
to that

1:37:55.599,1:38:01.610
no reexpress job done I'll see the gold

1:37:59.659,1:38:03.679
is not yet won but it would be a big

1:38:01.610,1:38:07.849
surprise if she doesn't come back and do

1:38:03.679,1:38:09.919
just that this evening so after the

1:38:07.849,1:38:14.629
final round round five all the women's

1:38:09.919,1:38:17.989
timmy to platform general in all are 48

1:38:14.629,1:38:20.119
marks ahead of Megan Ben Peter then the

1:38:17.989,1:38:22.689
impressive Australians today they're be

1:38:20.119,1:38:25.280
battling up maps for the bronze later

1:38:22.689,1:38:27.410
because the other Chinese who you Dan

1:38:25.280,1:38:29.180
down in ninth place and

1:38:27.410,1:38:32.420
on the other three to make it through

1:38:29.180,1:38:35.510
that key Espinoza Sanchez just did it

1:38:32.420,1:38:39.350
and for a gotcha - and Missy up by one

1:38:35.510,1:38:41.690
point four points in the end Kim on Yang

1:38:39.350,1:38:44.900
and no place for the two Americans

1:38:41.690,1:38:47.920
Brittany viola and Katie Bell both gone

1:38:44.900,1:38:47.920
not to return

1:38:57.510,1:39:03.090
so that's the semi-final of the woman's

1:39:00.180,1:39:05.760
10 metre platform done chin rule in the

1:39:03.090,1:39:07.680
outstanding competitor in it 12 will

1:39:05.760,1:39:09.390
return for the final seven o'clock

1:39:07.680,1:39:12.000
