0:00:00.000,0:00:03.270
every hope you've enjoyed where you've

0:00:01.110,0:00:05.640
seen so far the synchronized events and

0:00:03.270,0:00:07.770
the three meters for men and for women

0:00:05.640,0:00:11.400
we're going to the high board now 10

0:00:07.770,0:00:13.200
metre platform competition and we are at

0:00:11.400,0:00:17.520
the preliminary stage where we will

0:00:13.200,0:00:21.180
whittle down 26 to 18 for the semi-final

0:00:17.520,0:00:23.820
and then on to 12 for the final so quite

0:00:21.180,0:00:26.840
a quick turnaround for the competitors

0:00:23.820,0:00:30.240
here they will compete tonight UK time

0:00:26.840,0:00:33.000
in the prelims and then the semi finals

0:00:30.240,0:00:35.520
take place early tomorrow morning and

0:00:33.000,0:00:38.309
then they'll be back in the evening for

0:00:35.520,0:00:40.110
the final not maybe quite as many

0:00:38.309,0:00:41.579
competitors as we imagined there would

0:00:40.110,0:00:43.340
be but still quite a few so we're gonna

0:00:41.579,0:00:46.260
lose 8 tonight

0:00:43.340,0:00:48.239
most of the main diving countries are

0:00:46.260,0:00:50.670
represented and a few who don't have a

0:00:48.239,0:00:54.420
great depth in diving as well as you can

0:00:50.670,0:00:56.730
see a big crowd here to welcome the 10

0:00:54.420,0:00:58.920
meter competitors they men's by the way

0:00:56.730,0:01:01.530
in case you're wondering is on Friday UK

0:00:58.920,0:01:03.660
and on Saturday evening will be the

0:01:01.530,0:01:05.909
final but this is the preliminary of the

0:01:03.660,0:01:08.369
women's 10 metre platform man knows all

0:01:05.909,0:01:11.010
about 10 meter having won the synchro

0:01:08.369,0:01:14.670
silver medal in 2004 with Pete

0:01:11.010,0:01:16.619
Waterfield here's Leon Taylor what a

0:01:14.670,0:01:18.570
great shot of the the 10 meter board

0:01:16.619,0:01:20.880
those we were hovering above it and then

0:01:18.570,0:01:22.950
we can see it now from the more of a

0:01:20.880,0:01:25.170
deck level you can see the big drop down

0:01:22.950,0:01:27.689
cam just to the right of the 10 meter

0:01:25.170,0:01:30.150
we're going to be up close and personal

0:01:27.689,0:01:34.380
with the divers following them all the

0:01:30.150,0:01:38.070
way down and into the into the water and

0:01:34.380,0:01:39.659
there is the list of the divers will see

0:01:38.070,0:01:41.400
the list of the dives that they're going

0:01:39.659,0:01:44.369
to do a little later on we will have

0:01:41.400,0:01:46.890
couple of 16 year olds in here and a 15

0:01:44.369,0:01:51.210
year old as well so it is sometimes

0:01:46.890,0:01:55.049
considered a young person sport and also

0:01:51.210,0:01:58.350
a 14 year old yeah 14 15 and two 16 year

0:01:55.049,0:02:00.090
old so barely out of nappies and they'll

0:01:58.350,0:02:04.530
be competing on the women's 10 metre

0:02:00.090,0:02:06.850
platform here just looking at the stats

0:02:04.530,0:02:09.890
on a couple of the divers

0:02:06.850,0:02:12.680
about six or seven stone went through

0:02:09.890,0:02:14.269
there quite small but I thought I can't

0:02:12.680,0:02:15.650
even remember when I was six don't do it

0:02:14.269,0:02:17.390
quite nice for those of you watching

0:02:15.650,0:02:20.120
around the world will convert the enter

0:02:17.390,0:02:22.010
pounds and kilograms for you later on we

0:02:20.120,0:02:23.720
did we do it the whole service in if you

0:02:22.010,0:02:26.180
want a valet afterwards well sort that

0:02:23.720,0:02:29.209
out for you okay so what are we

0:02:26.180,0:02:31.190
expecting well it is it is it's a bit of

0:02:29.209,0:02:32.870
a marathon actually because the

0:02:31.190,0:02:34.310
preliminary scores do not carry through

0:02:32.870,0:02:35.870
to the semi-finals and of course the

0:02:34.310,0:02:37.790
semi-final scores do not carry through

0:02:35.870,0:02:40.370
to the final so you know you could win

0:02:37.790,0:02:42.500
the prelim and then it actually makes no

0:02:40.370,0:02:44.569
difference it's about driving steady

0:02:42.500,0:02:46.430
getting through and shuffling of the

0:02:44.569,0:02:48.230
pack so to speak so eighteen divers

0:02:46.430,0:02:50.510
going through so only gonna lose eight

0:02:48.230,0:02:52.430
which is isn't that many but it will be

0:02:50.510,0:02:53.930
highly contested and the girls have to

0:02:52.430,0:02:56.030
get up early tomorrow morning so there

0:02:53.930,0:02:58.640
won't be to bed until late tonight

0:02:56.030,0:03:00.560
finishing here in several hours time up

0:02:58.640,0:03:03.470
to three hours this competition is

0:03:00.560,0:03:05.720
scheduled to run for late finish back to

0:03:03.470,0:03:07.700
the Olympic Village some food try and

0:03:05.720,0:03:09.500
sleep full of adrenaline is never easy

0:03:07.700,0:03:11.350
and then up early in the morning to come

0:03:09.500,0:03:14.209
in and practice those dives once again

0:03:11.350,0:03:15.950
the all-important judges seven judges in

0:03:14.209,0:03:17.870
the individual competitions I just run

0:03:15.950,0:03:20.269
through how the judging works the judges

0:03:17.870,0:03:23.030
mark the dive on execution out of a

0:03:20.269,0:03:25.280
maximum of ten so if they think it's

0:03:23.030,0:03:27.290
okay there maybe give it a five five and

0:03:25.280,0:03:29.000
a half if they think it's good maybe a

0:03:27.290,0:03:30.620
seven or seven point five they think

0:03:29.000,0:03:32.599
it's really really good they might even

0:03:30.620,0:03:34.910
go eight and a half and nine those

0:03:32.599,0:03:36.620
scores are then collated the two highest

0:03:34.910,0:03:38.389
and two lowest judges scores are

0:03:36.620,0:03:40.099
discounted they will be shown on the

0:03:38.389,0:03:43.400
screen with lines through them to leave

0:03:40.099,0:03:45.709
three scores that can't these three war

0:03:43.400,0:03:48.319
scores are totaled together and then

0:03:45.709,0:03:50.959
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

0:03:48.319,0:03:52.880
for that particular dive the degree of

0:03:50.959,0:03:55.430
difficulty per dive is calculated on how

0:03:52.880,0:03:57.440
complex the dive is that gives a total

0:03:55.430,0:04:00.410
score for that dive each of the five

0:03:57.440,0:04:02.269
dives count Lisi cumulative score that

0:04:00.410,0:04:04.370
counts towards the placings at the end

0:04:02.269,0:04:05.720
of round five I hope that makes sense

0:04:04.370,0:04:08.660
which we'll revisit

0:04:05.720,0:04:11.090
during this long competition we shall

0:04:08.660,0:04:13.549
indeed and we still get us about those

0:04:11.090,0:04:16.099
marks who lines through hopefully now

0:04:13.549,0:04:18.019
we've nailed that so to speak in terms

0:04:16.099,0:04:19.739
of what you need to know about scoring

0:04:18.019,0:04:21.930
if it's gonna line through it doesn't

0:04:19.739,0:04:23.940
if it hasn't $1 that's pretty comes down

0:04:21.930,0:04:25.530
to basically and then you multiply that

0:04:23.940,0:04:27.960
by the degree of difficulty we're not

0:04:25.530,0:04:29.880
gonna be up in the 3.8 stakes here like

0:04:27.960,0:04:31.680
we will be in the men's three point

0:04:29.880,0:04:34.080
three I think is probably the the top

0:04:31.680,0:04:36.509
isn't it yeah I have a quick scan of all

0:04:34.080,0:04:38.250
the dive the divers of course submit all

0:04:36.509,0:04:39.870
their dives before and they have to go

0:04:38.250,0:04:42.479
in different directions we can talk you

0:04:39.870,0:04:43.979
through as the competition unfolds five

0:04:42.479,0:04:45.780
well there's actually six groups have

0:04:43.979,0:04:48.389
dives and the girls have to do five

0:04:45.780,0:04:49.710
dives each from a different group see

0:04:48.389,0:04:51.810
Brittney viola they're just going

0:04:49.710,0:04:53.220
through her visualization she's

0:04:51.810,0:04:54.780
visualizing the die because he have

0:04:53.220,0:04:55.710
eyelids fluttering there don't worry she

0:04:54.780,0:04:58.710
hasn't fallen asleep

0:04:55.710,0:05:00.360
she's just preparing herself mentally to

0:04:58.710,0:05:03.000
go with a physical preparation because

0:05:00.360,0:05:04.800
this needs to be what needs to be right

0:05:03.000,0:05:06.990
needs to count and she wants to make it

0:05:04.800,0:05:09.599
through she knows she needs five solid

0:05:06.990,0:05:10.800
dives twenty-five-year about twenty

0:05:09.599,0:05:13.199
five-year-old from America plenty of

0:05:10.800,0:05:16.349
experience behind her always to have to

0:05:13.199,0:05:18.210
go first she is just enacting the dive

0:05:16.349,0:05:20.039
on the top of the board before she gets

0:05:18.210,0:05:22.229
involved getting some water out of her

0:05:20.039,0:05:25.169
ears there hence the head banging or

0:05:22.229,0:05:27.240
head shaking and the towel being thrown

0:05:25.169,0:05:29.690
down the Shamy just to keep the drivers

0:05:27.240,0:05:34.020
dry so they can hold onto the shape

0:05:29.690,0:05:36.120
first I vent for the USA two American

0:05:34.020,0:05:38.550
competitors in this competition Brittany

0:05:36.120,0:05:40.460
viola is first it's a forward

0:05:38.550,0:05:43.020
three-and-a-half summer sorts with Pike

0:05:40.460,0:05:45.659
3.0 the degree of difficulty remember

0:05:43.020,0:05:48.580
the three marks multiplied by the degree

0:05:45.659,0:05:51.760
of difficulty for the total score

0:05:48.580,0:05:54.340
well to use and ours from the spectators

0:05:51.760,0:05:57.100
and it's very impressive this sport

0:05:54.340,0:05:58.960
plenty of support here for the u.s.

0:05:57.100,0:06:01.720
diving team they've already got a bag

0:05:58.960,0:06:03.670
full of medals from Brittany viola we'll

0:06:01.720,0:06:05.590
be looking to for safe passage through

0:06:03.670,0:06:07.330
these polymer ease the Pike shaped

0:06:05.590,0:06:10.180
folding at the hips beautiful shape

0:06:07.330,0:06:13.450
great aerial work it's a good tie for

0:06:10.180,0:06:16.570
the American to open up with she sets

0:06:13.450,0:06:19.810
sets her marker down pretty good market

0:06:16.570,0:06:21.430
it is 270 point 5 0 the mark on the

0:06:19.810,0:06:23.590
right hand side of your screen and the

0:06:21.430,0:06:25.360
one on the left hand side means that she

0:06:23.590,0:06:26.890
is number one in the rankings officer

0:06:25.360,0:06:29.890
she would be because she is the first

0:06:26.890,0:06:33.070
competitor now from France

0:06:29.890,0:06:35.710
Audrey LeBeau getting first lightly less

0:06:33.070,0:06:38.140
tariffs dive 2.8 to open up with inwards

0:06:35.710,0:06:45.100
two-and-a-half somersaults in the pike

0:06:38.140,0:06:47.260
position well over rotating the dive

0:06:45.100,0:06:49.810
tips over girls haven't got a lot of

0:06:47.260,0:06:51.460
time to wear squeeze all these rotations

0:06:49.810,0:06:54.340
in it's sometimes very easy to misjudge

0:06:51.460,0:06:56.830
the entry into the water and that's what

0:06:54.340,0:06:58.240
we're seeing there from audrey 27 years

0:06:56.830,0:06:59.890
old now so she's one of the more

0:06:58.240,0:07:02.410
experienced athletes in the field they

0:06:59.890,0:07:04.680
see over rotating throwing up too much

0:07:02.410,0:07:07.330
splash still landing as I was talking

0:07:04.680,0:07:11.620
which means the judges will penalize

0:07:07.330,0:07:12.820
that of course we will be down to 18 at

0:07:11.620,0:07:14.800
the end of this competition from the

0:07:12.820,0:07:17.920
original 26 so she has to make sure

0:07:14.800,0:07:23.200
she's in that field it's not the most

0:07:17.920,0:07:27.040
auspicious of starts for audrey 6.5

0:07:23.200,0:07:30.430
across the main part of our scoring 53.2

0:07:27.040,0:07:32.080
zero total mark now Meaghan been Fito

0:07:30.430,0:07:33.730
forth in Shanghai at the World

0:07:32.080,0:07:35.200
Championships fourth in Rome at the

0:07:33.730,0:07:37.270
World Championship what an incentive to

0:07:35.200,0:07:39.660
go one better here in London of the

0:07:37.270,0:07:39.660
Olympics

0:07:39.900,0:07:46.420
very steady very precise great entry

0:07:43.540,0:07:47.800
into the water a rip entry Canadians

0:07:46.420,0:07:49.180
having some good results here of course

0:07:47.800,0:07:52.330
it's young lady along with her partner

0:07:49.180,0:07:54.400
got a bronze medal in a very exciting 10

0:07:52.330,0:07:57.070
metre platform synchro here she is

0:07:54.400,0:07:59.230
individually today and that's a steady

0:07:57.070,0:08:01.000
star eight incoming and top of the

0:07:59.230,0:08:03.850
leaderboard at this early stage only

0:08:01.000,0:08:06.100
three divers in of course yeah it was

0:08:03.850,0:08:08.560
3.0 degree of difficulty so can't make a

0:08:06.100,0:08:11.460
direct comparison with viola and she

0:08:08.560,0:08:15.100
goes further goes higher and goes better

0:08:11.460,0:08:16.960
seventy-three point five zero for the

0:08:15.100,0:08:20.110
Canadian the first of two Canadians we

0:08:16.960,0:08:24.130
will see here comes the Olympic champion

0:08:20.110,0:08:27.220
world champion Chen Ruolin 3.0 for three

0:08:24.130,0:08:30.790
and a half again the opening dive you

0:08:27.220,0:08:32.229
know I should expect on the money from

0:08:30.790,0:08:34.240
this last I can't believe that she's

0:08:32.229,0:08:37.360
only 19 years old and she's already

0:08:34.240,0:08:39.310
Olympic champion at the age of 15 truly

0:08:37.360,0:08:40.930
extraordinary that's what we come to

0:08:39.310,0:08:42.160
expect from the Chinese of course not

0:08:40.930,0:08:44.370
having the wrong way in the pool last

0:08:42.160,0:08:47.770
night I'm sure the rest of the world is

0:08:44.370,0:08:50.020
infused and you know upbeat about taking

0:08:47.770,0:08:51.370
on these two girls today we're shown

0:08:50.020,0:08:53.530
reeling will certainly take some beating

0:08:51.370,0:08:55.960
and forward three and a half lots of

0:08:53.530,0:08:57.610
tape holding it together training so

0:08:55.960,0:08:59.440
hard eight point five s to count into

0:08:57.610,0:09:02.560
the lead and of course they do hit the

0:08:59.440,0:09:07.840
water at 34 35 miles an hour in that

0:09:02.560,0:09:11.680
kind of vicinity you already a pro cop

0:09:07.840,0:09:13.630
chuck of ukraine for three and a half

0:09:11.680,0:09:18.460
again this is a very popular opening

0:09:13.630,0:09:22.000
dive for the competitors with pike well

0:09:18.460,0:09:23.560
she does okay maybe just tuning as she

0:09:22.000,0:09:25.090
went into the water so I could see both

0:09:23.560,0:09:27.190
ankles and she went in let's have a look

0:09:25.090,0:09:28.840
at the replay to see if what I was

0:09:27.190,0:09:30.490
seeing actually happened or whether I'm

0:09:28.840,0:09:31.870
making up let's have a look so she's

0:09:30.490,0:09:33.820
squeezing into a pike shape needs to be

0:09:31.870,0:09:36.370
a little bit tighter there and she goes

0:09:33.820,0:09:37.480
in yeah it didn't look quite where it

0:09:36.370,0:09:46.980
needed to be on the fin

0:09:37.480,0:09:51.070
when we get sevens with an okay start 66

0:09:46.980,0:09:54.279
clickety-click Prakash up now the big

0:09:51.070,0:09:56.260
roar greets the arrival Oh Stacy Powell

0:09:54.279,0:09:57.639
the first of two Britons involving this

0:09:56.260,0:09:59.199
composition she's going for a high

0:09:57.639,0:10:01.690
tariff driver one of the higher tariffs

0:09:59.199,0:10:03.279
dives start off with and there's

0:10:01.690,0:10:05.320
anybody's watched our coverage over the

0:10:03.279,0:10:07.320
years we'll know I get the jitters with

0:10:05.320,0:10:09.310
the arm stance and I still believe

0:10:07.320,0:10:13.660
outdoors it should be worth more than

0:10:09.310,0:10:16.449
3.2 it is worth 3.2 indoors I keep

0:10:13.660,0:10:18.579
banging that drum the I shake my head

0:10:16.449,0:10:20.380
every time you say it honest and I'm sat

0:10:18.579,0:10:21.730
back at double somersault one and a half

0:10:20.380,0:10:23.889
twist there's no wind blowing through

0:10:21.730,0:10:25.540
here fortunately so we're no outside

0:10:23.889,0:10:31.750
elements to affect Stacy Powell's

0:10:25.540,0:10:34.660
everything dive well what a confidence

0:10:31.750,0:10:37.540
start coming in her opening dive in the

0:10:34.660,0:10:39.880
Olympic Games as if she wouldn't be

0:10:37.540,0:10:42.100
nervous enough already decides to show

0:10:39.880,0:10:44.410
how confident she is by starting with

0:10:42.100,0:10:46.290
this arm stand steady balance bends her

0:10:44.410,0:10:48.610
knees flicks off one and a half twist

0:10:46.290,0:10:50.649
double somersault of course hands to

0:10:48.610,0:10:54.069
hands it's a very neat and tidy dive

0:10:50.649,0:10:55.480
just you know leaving a little bit of a

0:10:54.069,0:10:57.040
dishes she went into the water which

0:10:55.480,0:10:59.589
means she'll probably only get sevens

0:10:57.040,0:11:02.380
from the judges but just showing her

0:10:59.589,0:11:04.060
confidence yeah she was hearing there a

0:11:02.380,0:11:05.769
little bit in the shape maybe going into

0:11:04.060,0:11:07.449
the twist a little bit early showing on

0:11:05.769,0:11:10.029
the replay there well don't stay skid

0:11:07.449,0:11:11.649
start 67 points to zero and we can

0:11:10.029,0:11:12.069
definitely promise you loads of chick

0:11:11.649,0:11:19.959
flicks

0:11:12.069,0:11:24.490
tonight on - Naomi back heat of Italy

0:11:19.959,0:11:26.079
going hungry representing Italy yeah you

0:11:24.490,0:11:28.120
can see lots of the girls opening up

0:11:26.079,0:11:30.399
with this the forward three and a half

0:11:28.120,0:11:32.980
as I mentioned at the beginning of the

0:11:30.399,0:11:34.360
competition each dive has to be in a

0:11:32.980,0:11:36.250
different group this is the forward

0:11:34.360,0:11:37.779
group this is the most popular no girls

0:11:36.250,0:11:40.089
here will do the forward four and a half

0:11:37.779,0:11:41.410
that we see from the men the forward

0:11:40.089,0:11:46.019
three and a half pipes and that is a

0:11:41.410,0:11:46.019
very very tidy dive from the Italian

0:11:46.760,0:11:54.079
no one's giving it away anything yet or

0:11:49.579,0:11:58.130
divers landing pretty consistently see

0:11:54.079,0:12:00.620
what the judges think of that dive 3.0

0:11:58.130,0:12:07.639
degree of difficulty 72 what sir in

0:12:00.620,0:12:09.529
third place now just on the lower end of

0:12:07.639,0:12:13.459
the tariff start off with not going for

0:12:09.529,0:12:15.709
broke straight off yes Kristen Stewart

0:12:13.459,0:12:18.829
of Germany in with two and a half summer

0:12:15.709,0:12:20.149
sports with pike 2.8 as your seat she

0:12:18.829,0:12:22.519
has really ground to make up on the

0:12:20.149,0:12:25.910
slightly higher tariff dives and round

0:12:22.519,0:12:27.560
one well she's going for a little bit of

0:12:25.910,0:12:29.899
an easier degree of difficulty lots of

0:12:27.560,0:12:31.699
girls going for the inward three and a

0:12:29.899,0:12:33.410
half in the Tuck position which carries

0:12:31.699,0:12:34.370
a higher degree of difficulty this the

0:12:33.410,0:12:36.019
two and a half in the pike position

0:12:34.370,0:12:37.490
spinning forwards it's important you

0:12:36.019,0:12:39.380
miss your toes on the diving board which

0:12:37.490,0:12:40.760
he does but she moves her hips back a

0:12:39.380,0:12:43.220
little bit too much on the start and

0:12:40.760,0:12:45.470
spins too slowly finishing very low

0:12:43.220,0:12:47.420
that's a very poor dive to start with

0:12:45.470,0:12:49.370
from this experienced German diver 29

0:12:47.420,0:12:52.339
years old she's been there and done it

0:12:49.370,0:12:53.930
several times before but today leaves

0:12:52.339,0:12:56.360
herself on the back foot after dive

0:12:53.930,0:13:01.040
number one leaves herself at the bottom

0:12:56.360,0:13:03.940
of the rung of the pecking order now

0:13:01.040,0:13:09.769
eighth place for the German after

0:13:03.940,0:13:14.540
opening dive money cladding 3.2 again

0:13:09.769,0:13:18.350
like a British teammate Stacy palp

0:13:14.540,0:13:22.010
going for my Terry for relatively high

0:13:18.350,0:13:23.810
tariff types if the women is 3.2 back

0:13:22.010,0:13:27.709
two and a half somersaults one a hard

0:13:23.810,0:13:30.350
twists hike this Manik I'm glad to be

0:13:27.709,0:13:31.910
here at all relate the story about white

0:13:30.350,0:13:37.180
she's very glad to be competing at this

0:13:31.910,0:13:37.180
Olympics after we've seen opening dive

0:13:38.680,0:13:44.610
oh it's a steady start from both of the

0:13:43.779,0:13:47.709
British girls

0:13:44.610,0:13:49.389
Monique 31 years old and I bumped into

0:13:47.709,0:13:51.249
her family on my way in here to

0:13:49.389,0:13:53.439
commentate today and they're so excited

0:13:51.249,0:13:55.360
to see him missed out eight years ago

0:13:53.439,0:13:57.730
before Athens missed out in Beijing here

0:13:55.360,0:14:00.069
she is competing in her first Olympic

0:13:57.730,0:14:01.809
Games starting with one more difficult

0:14:00.069,0:14:03.309
dives three point two one and a half

0:14:01.809,0:14:05.619
twist into the two and a half

0:14:03.309,0:14:07.240
somersaults she's had some tough

0:14:05.619,0:14:10.779
challenges coming into this with

0:14:07.240,0:14:12.399
injuries recently neck and some various

0:14:10.779,0:14:13.660
other things but she's here and she'll

0:14:12.399,0:14:15.970
be fighting for a place in the

0:14:13.660,0:14:19.059
semi-final and she matches her British

0:14:15.970,0:14:23.949
teammate Stacy pal they open up with 67

0:14:19.059,0:14:27.399
point to 0 both 16 years of age you Dan

0:14:23.949,0:14:30.730
oh well there you go

0:14:27.399,0:14:32.889
he wasn't wanting to hang around I need

0:14:30.730,0:14:35.619
to get the dive done straightaway since

0:14:32.889,0:14:36.939
only tiny isn't she ended up short as

0:14:35.619,0:14:39.160
she went in the water there which will

0:14:36.939,0:14:41.230
cost her she'll only get sevens at best

0:14:39.160,0:14:42.999
on this all looks good so far just let's

0:14:41.230,0:14:44.620
go a little bit too early and the water

0:14:42.999,0:14:46.629
hitting her on the front of her body

0:14:44.620,0:14:47.800
there splashed being thrown up not too

0:14:46.629,0:14:50.170
much because there wasn't very much of

0:14:47.800,0:14:51.759
her to make any splash but this young

0:14:50.170,0:14:53.949
lady had been watching you in training

0:14:51.759,0:14:56.499
she's formidable she'll be challenging

0:14:53.949,0:14:58.899
her teammate ship chain rule in but not

0:14:56.499,0:15:00.670
with the dive like that I wonder if she

0:14:58.899,0:15:05.670
has got a Chinese upgrade on these

0:15:00.670,0:15:11.800
scores here we come 7.5 for who you Dan

0:15:05.670,0:15:17.730
60 7.50 is her opening mark now from it

0:15:11.800,0:15:19.929
was republic of korea it's kim yang and

0:15:17.730,0:15:21.819
we've seen already quite a few times

0:15:19.929,0:15:23.559
forward three and a half somersaults

0:15:21.819,0:15:27.429
with pike very popular dive first round

0:15:23.559,0:15:29.589
this one with Mike oh wow she really

0:15:27.429,0:15:32.829
attacked that didn't she probably gave

0:15:29.589,0:15:34.629
it a little bit too much and you can

0:15:32.829,0:15:38.139
quite clearly say the over rotation into

0:15:34.629,0:15:39.069
the into the water she absolutely motors

0:15:38.139,0:15:41.230
this landing on the end

0:15:39.069,0:15:42.459
divers choosing to use a towel maybe it

0:15:41.230,0:15:44.559
gives a bit more grip but it certainly

0:15:42.459,0:15:48.970
diver preference but look at that over

0:15:44.559,0:15:51.320
she goes for force 4.5 probably that is

0:15:48.970,0:15:54.259
quite far over vertical

0:15:51.320,0:15:56.620
and she'll have some work to do on the

0:15:54.259,0:16:00.709
golf course remain there shouting four

0:15:56.620,0:16:04.190
five four and a half and a five for Kim

0:16:00.709,0:16:07.149
coming hang and that's not gonna do her

0:16:04.190,0:16:09.889
chances of progression much good at all

0:16:07.149,0:16:12.620
here's brittany broman sixteen years of

0:16:09.889,0:16:14.990
age from australia those tariffs we've

0:16:12.620,0:16:22.399
seen so far 2.7 on this reverse two and

0:16:14.990,0:16:25.430
a half several sorts with tuck oh it's a

0:16:22.399,0:16:26.990
beautiful dive to open up with only 16

0:16:25.430,0:16:29.569
years old haven't seen much of this girl

0:16:26.990,0:16:32.060
at all the new girl on the block there's

0:16:29.569,0:16:34.459
a coach he likes to start to reverse so

0:16:32.060,0:16:36.970
you're standing forwards jumping away

0:16:34.459,0:16:39.800
from the diving board spinning backwards

0:16:36.970,0:16:41.209
beautiful technique just tipping over a

0:16:39.800,0:16:43.009
vertical slightly that's going to get

0:16:41.209,0:16:45.139
eight and eight point five it's a

0:16:43.009,0:16:49.550
beautiful start very confident for a

0:16:45.139,0:16:50.899
young 16 year old Ozzy's on the board

0:16:49.550,0:16:53.300
whether it be three meter or ten meter

0:16:50.899,0:16:55.100
have been quite confident so far and he

0:16:53.300,0:16:57.100
point fives across the board for her

0:16:55.100,0:17:00.440
gives her a sixty eight point eight five

0:16:57.100,0:17:04.269
with that opening round dive second one

0:17:00.440,0:17:04.269
of the Italians now Brenda spazzy on e

0:17:04.360,0:17:09.919
2.8 they only will be well beyond my

0:17:08.360,0:17:10.250
compass and probably yours at home as

0:17:09.919,0:17:13.089
well

0:17:10.250,0:17:16.299
inward to and our summer sorts with Pike

0:17:13.089,0:17:16.299
opening dive

0:17:28.430,0:17:32.160
well I think you could see the nerves

0:17:30.570,0:17:34.860
there at home couldn't you so she was

0:17:32.160,0:17:37.680
twitching the cameraman zoom right in on

0:17:34.860,0:17:39.180
it on the on the thumbs and fingers she

0:17:37.680,0:17:40.530
little bit close to the diving board you

0:17:39.180,0:17:42.300
can see a flattening of feet there this

0:17:40.530,0:17:44.100
is the danger on this dive is very easy

0:17:42.300,0:17:45.900
to tip your toes on it it doesn't hurt

0:17:44.100,0:17:47.850
but it does throw you off look at this

0:17:45.900,0:17:49.410
dip oh no she just misses the diving

0:17:47.850,0:17:52.080
board that does put her boots on as she

0:17:49.410,0:17:53.550
goes by in order to miss it it's a

0:17:52.080,0:17:55.050
technical diving turn putting your boots

0:17:53.550,0:17:56.820
on I'm sure you're getting into it now

0:17:55.050,0:17:58.860
look at that beautiful super slow motion

0:17:56.820,0:18:01.530
into the entry there from the fixed

0:17:58.860,0:18:04.320
cameras a little bit off the mark for

0:18:01.530,0:18:06.150
Brenda fifty four point six zero and

0:18:04.320,0:18:07.110
those indulging in the Leon Taylor

0:18:06.150,0:18:08.850
drinking game

0:18:07.110,0:18:13.650
that's probably your first one of the

0:18:08.850,0:18:16.950
evening now Karolina I mean those are

0:18:13.650,0:18:18.420
Hernandez of Mexico again it's a for

0:18:16.950,0:18:20.390
three and a half somersaults with Pike

0:18:18.420,0:18:22.950
and again you can compare and contrast

0:18:20.390,0:18:32.700
as dive with plenty of the others in the

0:18:22.950,0:18:34.500
first round this is an exciting divers

0:18:32.700,0:18:36.150
he's only 15 years old and I'm just

0:18:34.500,0:18:39.210
looking down the her list of dives and

0:18:36.150,0:18:41.040
she is bringing out the big guns for her

0:18:39.210,0:18:44.220
competition here this is of easiest dive

0:18:41.040,0:18:46.230
at 3.0 everything else is really really

0:18:44.220,0:18:48.450
tricky she's got a lot of tape on there

0:18:46.230,0:18:49.740
on her back again we discussed this

0:18:48.450,0:18:51.960
every time lots of the divers held

0:18:49.740,0:18:54.000
together by sticky tape this young

0:18:51.960,0:18:55.830
Mexican just on the down the right-hand

0:18:54.000,0:18:58.650
side of her back they're obviously

0:18:55.830,0:19:00.980
suffering as many of these divers to I

0:18:58.650,0:19:04.770
do because of the strains of the sport

0:19:00.980,0:19:07.680
seven point five and sevens will count

0:19:04.770,0:19:11.850
towards the total and she gets sixty

0:19:07.680,0:19:15.600
four point five zero second of the

0:19:11.850,0:19:18.090
Canadians are Rosaleen feel it's gonna

0:19:15.600,0:19:19.800
be that's yeah you seen it before and

0:19:18.090,0:19:22.980
you'll see it many more times every

0:19:19.800,0:19:25.340
diver will do this pretty much see for

0:19:22.980,0:19:29.090
three and a half seven sorts with Pike

0:19:25.340,0:19:31.799
3.0 degree of difficulty

0:19:29.090,0:19:34.260
very steady just like a teammate of

0:19:31.799,0:19:36.179
course they were bronze medalists nearly

0:19:34.260,0:19:37.679
last week and that's got to make you

0:19:36.179,0:19:39.540
feel good coming into your individual

0:19:37.679,0:19:41.910
event riding on a high although they've

0:19:39.540,0:19:45.080
had a bit of a wait and no more waiting

0:19:41.910,0:19:48.799
around now this is it you're in prelims

0:19:45.080,0:19:51.390
there's the little over a vertical

0:19:48.799,0:19:54.710
strong powerful takeoff squeezing into

0:19:51.390,0:19:58.470
the pike there we go

0:19:54.710,0:20:05.309
so what'd you get for that she got 63 my

0:19:58.470,0:20:07.650
favourite score of the week 7 x 3 degree

0:20:05.309,0:20:09.690
of difficulty gives you 63 and now it's

0:20:07.650,0:20:11.870
pretty seen Melissa whoop in the synchro

0:20:09.690,0:20:14.460
the other day but she wasn't there cuz

0:20:11.870,0:20:18.809
and she didn't make it through so here

0:20:14.460,0:20:20.730
she is in the individual yeah but she'll

0:20:18.809,0:20:23.190
have a point to prove here had to wait

0:20:20.730,0:20:25.380
patiently all week watching her

0:20:23.190,0:20:27.799
teammates I've been been on right from

0:20:25.380,0:20:31.320
the start lands perfectly on the end

0:20:27.799,0:20:33.990
long legs looks good when she's spinning

0:20:31.320,0:20:35.820
around just a little bit of splashes she

0:20:33.990,0:20:40.559
goes in but that's a really solid start

0:20:35.820,0:20:45.390
here come eight maybe even 8.5 s-stupid

0:20:40.559,0:20:47.340
dive yeah I saw it start for Melissa

0:20:45.390,0:20:49.710
woods had to wait a long time I having

0:20:47.340,0:20:53.270
been involved in the timid synchro the

0:20:49.710,0:20:56.120
other day back in with three-eighths 72

0:20:53.270,0:21:03.590
smart on the coach gets from the coach

0:20:56.120,0:21:03.590
happy now Maria Carillo of Germany

0:21:06.710,0:21:10.770
yeah you're getting used to seeing this

0:21:08.760,0:21:12.570
dive now just probably a little bit too

0:21:10.770,0:21:14.880
much philosophy and thrown up there and

0:21:12.570,0:21:16.440
it knows so much about this German he's

0:21:14.880,0:21:18.780
done very well to make the team highly

0:21:16.440,0:21:20.580
contested on the platform what's the

0:21:18.780,0:21:22.650
teammate fault of earlier looking to

0:21:20.580,0:21:25.380
pick up from that she's done a

0:21:22.650,0:21:26.970
reasonable job just a little low on the

0:21:25.380,0:21:30.380
water throwing at the splash they're

0:21:26.970,0:21:30.380
going back towards the diving board

0:21:31.010,0:21:34.799
there we go look at the view of the

0:21:33.179,0:21:37.400
Aquatic Center that front on shot there

0:21:34.799,0:21:41.130
with the eyes iconic diving boards

0:21:37.400,0:21:43.380
certainly are many many tons of

0:21:41.130,0:21:45.990
concrete's gone into that many hours of

0:21:43.380,0:21:48.179
preparation for Maria Carillo who's

0:21:45.990,0:21:50.220
there 6.5 s in the opening round dive

0:21:48.179,0:21:55.160
his another person who was involved in

0:21:50.220,0:21:57.419
the sync really owed a pang of Malaysia

0:21:55.160,0:22:00.929
well welcome pundit Leno that's a

0:21:57.419,0:22:04.380
beautiful dive and it works very hard

0:22:00.929,0:22:05.850
again often has injury troubles let's

0:22:04.380,0:22:08.910
see how much tape she's sporting yet

0:22:05.850,0:22:10.140
both ankles both wrists but she

0:22:08.910,0:22:11.790
certainly gets going there look at that

0:22:10.140,0:22:13.950
pike shakes you almost has a chin on her

0:22:11.790,0:22:17.669
ankles that's incredible flexibility and

0:22:13.950,0:22:19.320
there's a beautiful dive as well should

0:22:17.669,0:22:23.220
put a top of the pile or there abouts

0:22:19.320,0:22:24.179
after the first round or so far yeah

0:22:23.220,0:22:25.440
just didn't try that at home

0:22:24.179,0:22:27.540
putting your chin on your ankles you

0:22:25.440,0:22:29.929
might do yourself a mischief for the

0:22:27.540,0:22:29.929
divers

0:22:30.870,0:22:37.280
our opening score is 72 quite a popular

0:22:33.450,0:22:40.260
one three three divers on that mark 72

0:22:37.280,0:22:44.550
chen leading the way pan Fito in second

0:22:40.260,0:22:51.680
kim jin OCH from people's republic of

0:22:44.550,0:22:54.660
korea kim yep for three and a half oh

0:22:51.680,0:22:56.760
it's a very tidy type good entry into

0:22:54.660,0:22:59.660
the water just a little over vertical as

0:22:56.760,0:23:02.130
she goes in otherwise a very good effort

0:22:59.660,0:23:03.750
strong powerful take off you could these

0:23:02.130,0:23:06.900
divers all plenty of tape everywhere

0:23:03.750,0:23:10.820
ankles calf's trying to hold themselves

0:23:06.900,0:23:13.080
together it's a very solid start

0:23:10.820,0:23:16.140
can we be very pleased with that

0:23:13.080,0:23:18.590
I wonder if the coaches will never

0:23:16.140,0:23:20.820
really know where the coaches another 72

0:23:18.590,0:23:28.320
that seems to be the popular score

0:23:20.820,0:23:33.780
tonight four girls on that thanks Annie

0:23:28.320,0:23:36.150
Rivera of Cuba difference for you this

0:23:33.780,0:23:37.980
time lower degree of difficulty 2.8 for

0:23:36.150,0:23:41.820
the inward two and a half summer sorts

0:23:37.980,0:23:43.350
with pike very very safe distance from

0:23:41.820,0:23:44.880
the diving board and I mentioned last

0:23:43.350,0:23:48.330
time we watched this dive it is only two

0:23:44.880,0:23:50.760
point eight degree of difficulty moves

0:23:48.330,0:23:52.230
it away the safe distance so she didn't

0:23:50.760,0:23:54.780
have to flatten her feet she goes by

0:23:52.230,0:23:56.550
there we go and then just hangs on a

0:23:54.780,0:23:58.530
little bit too long in the pike shape

0:23:56.550,0:23:59.760
@gs tips over a vertical look at the

0:23:58.530,0:24:00.240
splash going back towards the diving

0:23:59.760,0:24:02.760
board

0:24:00.240,0:24:06.630
fives probably for that effort and some

0:24:02.760,0:24:11.100
work to do how generous the judges

0:24:06.630,0:24:13.650
feeling 5.5 s who will into account so

0:24:11.100,0:24:17.429
three scores discounted four scores

0:24:13.650,0:24:23.910
discounted and three will remain in

0:24:17.429,0:24:25.350
place now Tracy took yet Malaysia

0:24:23.910,0:24:26.790
opted for the dive that pretty much

0:24:25.350,0:24:29.750
everybody else in the first round has

0:24:26.790,0:24:29.750
the for three and a half

0:24:29.990,0:24:34.980
yeah just rolling into the water not

0:24:33.030,0:24:36.510
quite straightening out she went in so

0:24:34.980,0:24:38.370
the judges will take some marks off for

0:24:36.510,0:24:41.550
that even though the entry was clean

0:24:38.370,0:24:43.950
minimal splash she didn't quite complete

0:24:41.550,0:24:45.360
the dive in time so yeah lots of divers

0:24:43.950,0:24:48.900
opting for the forward three and a half

0:24:45.360,0:24:50.160
in the pike position it is 3.0 some of

0:24:48.900,0:24:52.320
the girls might do it in the Tuck

0:24:50.160,0:24:54.750
position but all girls choosing to do

0:24:52.320,0:24:56.550
the forward group of course they've got

0:24:54.750,0:24:59.040
six groups to choose from the forward is

0:24:56.550,0:25:00.840
only one of six so you will see some

0:24:59.040,0:25:02.820
variance but it seems to be a popular

0:25:00.840,0:25:08.070
opener in the women's competition

0:25:02.820,0:25:09.570
yeah 66 this time 7.5 times to seven ran

0:25:08.070,0:25:12.090
up to a total I was mentioning about

0:25:09.570,0:25:14.280
weights and Heights earlier on you know

0:25:12.090,0:25:22.580
as Katie belt 6:30 eleven I should

0:25:14.280,0:25:22.580
prefer 48 kilograms 18 pounds

0:25:22.700,0:25:28.770
okay I'll compose smile take a

0:25:25.880,0:25:31.970
perspiration off the fingers it's

0:25:28.770,0:25:31.970
counting yourself anything

0:25:34.380,0:25:39.030
well she was having a chat with the

0:25:36.270,0:25:41.370
South before she ran off the the end of

0:25:39.030,0:25:42.570
the ten meter board there I wonder what

0:25:41.370,0:25:44.280
she was saying I was curious we weren't

0:25:42.570,0:25:46.710
quite close enough to the speakers to

0:25:44.280,0:25:48.780
hear I think Bob my Bob's guests may

0:25:46.710,0:25:51.600
have may be accurate of counting

0:25:48.780,0:25:52.830
yourself in you know sometimes divers do

0:25:51.600,0:25:56.370
a little I used to talk to myself but

0:25:52.830,0:25:58.350
only in my head I used to say some yeah

0:25:56.370,0:26:00.150
but I'm speaking into the microphone now

0:25:58.350,0:26:02.549
so you can all hear my thoughts lucky

0:26:00.150,0:26:05.970
you all at home anyway not so lucky for

0:26:02.549,0:26:07.679
young miss belt just over a vertical and

0:26:05.970,0:26:09.510
she went in you can see how small she is

0:26:07.679,0:26:11.909
there next to her if every talk coach

0:26:09.510,0:26:13.740
it's quite a contrast isn't it yeah

0:26:11.909,0:26:19.080
Casey bell dropping a clangor on her

0:26:13.740,0:26:21.299
opening round now power Espinoza Sanchez

0:26:19.080,0:26:23.070
our Mexico watched this girl she's

0:26:21.299,0:26:28.890
pretty decent bronze medalist in the

0:26:23.070,0:26:31.230
world's last year oh yeah four hurt now

0:26:28.890,0:26:33.539
already silver medalist in the 10-meter

0:26:31.230,0:26:36.600
synchro and as bob was mentioning a

0:26:33.539,0:26:40.049
phenomenal athlete known for her spring

0:26:36.600,0:26:42.360
and power and dynamic diving and not so

0:26:40.049,0:26:45.240
well known for landing over a vertical

0:26:42.360,0:26:48.059
on an opening dive however it was a good

0:26:45.240,0:26:50.070
dive apart from the fault on the entry

0:26:48.059,0:26:52.320
so she's very high and it was a good

0:26:50.070,0:26:54.929
good shape in the air so they're not

0:26:52.320,0:26:56.669
gonna go to town on her so much it's

0:26:54.929,0:26:58.860
making her way back there so on the mark

0:26:56.669,0:27:01.590
cs7 she gets away with it there may be a

0:26:58.860,0:27:03.179
reputation saving her yeah she will

0:27:01.590,0:27:05.429
improve I'm sure she'll be back we'll

0:27:03.179,0:27:07.799
hope she'll be back for the semi-final

0:27:05.429,0:27:10.200
because she's a very entertaining and

0:27:07.799,0:27:13.289
very classy individual when it comes to

0:27:10.200,0:27:17.460
this competition now secondly of the arm

0:27:13.289,0:27:20.730
stands I'm not looking Yuliya colton

0:27:17.460,0:27:23.070
over not quite as complicated as Stacey

0:27:20.730,0:27:25.230
pounds the arm stand forward double

0:27:23.070,0:27:28.650
somersault one twist with free still

0:27:25.230,0:27:32.330
difficult enough oh what an entry what

0:27:28.650,0:27:34.919
an absolute beauty of an entry yes

0:27:32.330,0:27:39.780
disappeared into the water hardly a

0:27:34.919,0:27:41.280
ripple of splash wow that really is

0:27:39.780,0:27:43.169
quite something arm stamp balance

0:27:41.280,0:27:44.850
flicking off here we go there's a one

0:27:43.169,0:27:46.710
twist it's the double somersault

0:27:44.850,0:27:47.700
it's tricky there's a lot going on I

0:27:46.710,0:27:51.440
think it's more

0:27:47.700,0:27:54.929
complicated than the 3.1 but there we go

0:27:51.440,0:27:59.820
what an entry maybe squeeze some nines

0:27:54.929,0:28:01.769
from the judges hardly a droplet

0:27:59.820,0:28:05.399
splashes she goes in even on the slow

0:28:01.769,0:28:08.610
motion and that dive takes her into the

0:28:05.399,0:28:12.750
lead seventy nine point zero five ahead

0:28:08.610,0:28:15.120
are Chen and Ben feet oh who were four

0:28:12.750,0:28:18.120
one and two they're now 2 and 3 and the

0:28:15.120,0:28:21.409
Russian 24th diver and the competition

0:28:18.120,0:28:21.409
goes into the lead

0:28:21.649,0:28:30.899
my Nakagawa arm Japan inwards

0:28:26.370,0:28:35.490
two and a half with Mike your beautiful

0:28:30.899,0:28:37.049
dive on Nakagawa yeah there we are the

0:28:35.490,0:28:40.830
friends and family here from all over

0:28:37.049,0:28:42.389
the world to support these athletes just

0:28:40.830,0:28:44.010
touching their toes on the diving board

0:28:42.389,0:28:45.269
though I didn't see that in real speed I

0:28:44.010,0:28:47.220
don't think the judges will see it

0:28:45.269,0:28:49.440
either because she didn't falter but she

0:28:47.220,0:28:51.179
did danke toes on the diving board now

0:28:49.440,0:28:53.279
because he didn't affect the dive in the

0:28:51.179,0:28:54.960
judges don't get the replays I think she

0:28:53.279,0:28:57.330
got out she could hang with it well done

0:28:54.960,0:28:58.409
done that's a poker face as well as

0:28:57.330,0:29:00.590
though she wasn't gonna give anything

0:28:58.409,0:29:01.950
away there seventy one point four zero

0:29:00.590,0:29:05.130
four

0:29:01.950,0:29:08.639
Nakagawa now the last diver the youngest

0:29:05.130,0:29:13.649
diver in the competition when you get

0:29:08.639,0:29:16.110
along with it - oh no no guess it's

0:29:13.649,0:29:19.529
there what happened there splash giving

0:29:16.110,0:29:22.200
it away legging it into the end of the

0:29:19.529,0:29:24.120
diving board all looks okay so far and

0:29:22.200,0:29:27.990
that's now is when you want to come out

0:29:24.120,0:29:29.639
oh just over she goes Louis going diver

0:29:27.990,0:29:34.470
the competition from the youngest diver

0:29:29.639,0:29:37.880
in the competition Kim from Korea 14

0:29:34.470,0:29:37.880
years of age he is

0:29:38.040,0:29:44.070
phors give me a total of 36 and the

0:29:41.510,0:29:47.250
coach is not gonna be relenting in terms

0:29:44.070,0:29:53.820
of passing on his wisdom slap on the

0:29:47.250,0:29:56.790
fight and the end of the first round of

0:29:53.820,0:29:59.430
the women's 10 meters platform and the

0:29:56.790,0:30:02.970
preliminary standings after round 1 I'll

0:29:59.430,0:30:06.270
turn over Chen and benefit 0 1 2 3

0:30:02.970,0:30:08.310
plenty in 4th place top 18 remember

0:30:06.270,0:30:10.760
going through and at the moment both of

0:30:08.310,0:30:14.310
the British divers are going through

0:30:10.760,0:30:15.660
just well don't have a dime often I'm

0:30:14.310,0:30:19.440
sure they won't happen but at the bottom

0:30:15.660,0:30:21.180
joint 17th and these are the ones who

0:30:19.440,0:30:23.340
have a little bit of work to do even at

0:30:21.180,0:30:26.640
this early stage and you think the two

0:30:23.340,0:30:28.590
Kim's probably not going to be involved

0:30:26.640,0:30:30.830
in the shake-up at the end even at this

0:30:28.590,0:30:30.830
stage

0:30:34.600,0:30:42.009
very impressive arena this the Aquatic

0:30:38.110,0:30:44.080
Center in Olympic Park and beautifully

0:30:42.009,0:30:46.240
shaped ten meter board really

0:30:44.080,0:30:49.799
artistically everything about this venue

0:30:46.240,0:30:52.750
has been artistic let's see whether

0:30:49.799,0:30:55.090
Brittany viola can be artistic on her

0:30:52.750,0:30:56.919
arm stand back at double somersault one

0:30:55.090,0:31:00.940
and a half twist three point two a

0:30:56.919,0:31:04.539
degree of difficulty and about 30 feet

0:31:00.940,0:31:10.779
up no Marja forever Ferrara with those

0:31:04.539,0:31:13.500
feet right over the edge and taking all

0:31:10.779,0:31:13.500
the weight

0:31:19.700,0:31:25.740
well it's dramatic isn't it balancing on

0:31:23.669,0:31:27.990
the end you could see put these mum

0:31:25.740,0:31:30.600
there holding her breath as a daughter

0:31:27.990,0:31:32.010
lifted herself up with perfect control

0:31:30.600,0:31:33.960
into that arm stamp bending the knees

0:31:32.010,0:31:36.600
it's called the flick one and a half

0:31:33.960,0:31:39.809
twist squares it up nicely on the end

0:31:36.600,0:31:43.139
finishes accurately on the water nice a

0:31:39.809,0:31:45.830
curve and I've servile looks very very

0:31:43.139,0:31:49.320
focused I've not seen it look so focused

0:31:45.830,0:31:51.360
working for so far yeah good mark for

0:31:49.320,0:31:52.799
her coach will never be happy of course

0:31:51.360,0:31:54.570
in this thing she can't improve on it

0:31:52.799,0:31:57.870
for next time around crying she's there

0:31:54.570,0:32:01.159
seventy-three point six zero for viola

0:31:57.870,0:32:03.779
of the USA in there Audrey in the boat

0:32:01.159,0:32:05.340
and the fifty three point two to start

0:32:03.779,0:32:07.590
with so she's got a bit of ground to

0:32:05.340,0:32:09.480
make up already she's not into the

0:32:07.590,0:32:10.860
threes yet two point nine degree of

0:32:09.480,0:32:12.779
difficulty on this back two and a half

0:32:10.860,0:32:18.299
summer sorts with Mike for the French

0:32:12.779,0:32:20.190
woman voice a very good entry short of

0:32:18.299,0:32:23.279
vertical but she manages to hold

0:32:20.190,0:32:25.649
attention hold her body tension and get

0:32:23.279,0:32:29.100
a very very good rip entry into the

0:32:25.649,0:32:31.080
water it's a relatively easy dive in

0:32:29.100,0:32:32.700
comparison to some of the others two

0:32:31.080,0:32:35.460
point eight degree two point nine degree

0:32:32.700,0:32:37.830
of difficulty I beg your pardon but when

0:32:35.460,0:32:40.440
it's done like that'll get a reasonable

0:32:37.830,0:32:44.279
score and keep her well upping a game

0:32:40.440,0:32:45.600
actually from the first round I've yeah

0:32:44.279,0:32:46.230
certainly a big improvement from the

0:32:45.600,0:32:48.840
first round

0:32:46.230,0:32:50.130
fifty three up to sixty eight now the

0:32:48.840,0:32:52.889
degree of difficulty was slightly

0:32:50.130,0:32:56.360
improved and the dive itself was very

0:32:52.889,0:32:59.610
much improved their round after the

0:32:56.360,0:33:01.049
third after the first round let's

0:32:59.610,0:33:05.669
rearrange these words in it to make a

0:33:01.049,0:33:07.110
sentence Megan Ben feet o of Canada

0:33:05.669,0:33:09.899
going with a back three-and-a-half

0:33:07.110,0:33:11.460
samasource look at the difficulty right

0:33:09.899,0:33:13.480
at the top of the shop here three point

0:33:11.460,0:33:16.000
three on this one

0:33:13.480,0:33:19.059
rawrr she's landed it very well indeed

0:33:16.000,0:33:20.679
it's high-risk so Audrey before her

0:33:19.059,0:33:22.929
opting for the backward two-and-a-half

0:33:20.679,0:33:25.480
in the pike position 2.9 degree of

0:33:22.929,0:33:27.820
difficulty this the backward a three and

0:33:25.480,0:33:30.040
a half three point three degree of

0:33:27.820,0:33:32.650
difficulty so if you get it right it can

0:33:30.040,0:33:35.290
work for you and megan has done just

0:33:32.650,0:33:39.549
that she get on this seven half stand

0:33:35.290,0:33:42.400
eights I think leave her smiling after a

0:33:39.549,0:33:43.900
second round I've I'm sure the marks

0:33:42.400,0:33:46.059
without the lines through them the ones

0:33:43.900,0:33:48.130
account eight eight and seven point five

0:33:46.059,0:33:49.630
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

0:33:48.130,0:33:51.390
that's how we arrive at seventy-seven

0:33:49.630,0:33:54.669
point five five

0:33:51.390,0:33:57.850
now the olympic and world champion chen

0:33:54.669,0:33:59.919
rule in second after round one in with

0:33:57.850,0:34:01.840
three and a half Witek when a three

0:33:59.919,0:34:04.350
point two in terms of degree of

0:34:01.840,0:34:04.350
difficulty

0:34:06.610,0:34:11.619
or throwing up more splashing I was

0:34:09.339,0:34:13.480
expecting the entry seemed to be well

0:34:11.619,0:34:15.730
all in order if you like so she

0:34:13.480,0:34:18.070
disappeared but then this big volcano of

0:34:15.730,0:34:21.520
splash came up afterwards take off is

0:34:18.070,0:34:23.050
very good seems to be all good from here

0:34:21.520,0:34:25.540
I bite into the water as a vertical

0:34:23.050,0:34:28.060
entry but look at that bubbles up like a

0:34:25.540,0:34:30.280
geyser Keita I don't know what they call

0:34:28.060,0:34:31.270
those things that bubble up water what

0:34:30.280,0:34:33.609
are they called Bob

0:34:31.270,0:34:36.339
Ziggy's around here you believe you

0:34:33.609,0:34:39.190
didn't response East End remember yep

0:34:36.339,0:34:43.320
that's chain rule in yeah geez are we

0:34:39.190,0:34:48.940
fine yeah it worked now onto a olia

0:34:43.320,0:34:50.470
Prokop chuck of Ukraine and I'm peeing

0:34:48.940,0:34:52.629
the stakes for most of them now in with

0:34:50.470,0:34:56.200
three and a half somersaults 3.2 with

0:34:52.629,0:35:01.089
tuck 14th after round 1 she stays there

0:34:56.200,0:35:03.970
she'll be fine for the semi war very

0:35:01.089,0:35:06.339
good indeed finishing a little bit low

0:35:03.970,0:35:09.430
on the water teammates like it hush up

0:35:06.339,0:35:12.339
and featured yesterday's final cheering

0:35:09.430,0:35:14.170
on his teammate here and there we go

0:35:12.339,0:35:16.359
safe distance from the diving board yes

0:35:14.170,0:35:17.859
I know it's not far away but it's saved

0:35:16.359,0:35:19.839
a little bit low on the water but she's

0:35:17.859,0:35:22.180
very sneaky on that finish that could

0:35:19.839,0:35:25.290
get 80 points and if it does then she'll

0:35:22.180,0:35:30.880
be way up there after the second round

0:35:25.290,0:35:34.750
anything in the 70s is good Oh 80 and I

0:35:30.880,0:35:36.070
won't count hi mark but 80 is high mark

0:35:34.750,0:35:40.180
and that will move far up the standings

0:35:36.070,0:35:41.560
quite some way decent opening for Stacy

0:35:40.180,0:35:43.480
Powell with the armstand

0:35:41.560,0:35:45.730
spell I want out of the way now she can

0:35:43.480,0:35:48.490
concentrate on another high tariff dive

0:35:45.730,0:35:50.589
three point three so I tariff program

0:35:48.490,0:35:53.260
this a lot of risk attached to it but if

0:35:50.589,0:35:55.510
it works out and you go shooting into

0:35:53.260,0:35:57.849
the semi-final that's obviously the plan

0:35:55.510,0:36:00.750
for Stacey power back three and a half

0:35:57.849,0:36:03.849
somersaults with tuck three point three

0:36:00.750,0:36:06.540
for the first of the Britons diving in

0:36:03.849,0:36:06.540
round two

0:36:11.390,0:36:17.010
or that could prove to be critical Stacy

0:36:15.570,0:36:19.290
with some work to do this is the only

0:36:17.010,0:36:21.270
dive in a program that could potentially

0:36:19.290,0:36:23.550
have leather dye and it's a highest

0:36:21.270,0:36:25.200
degree of difficulty it's the one that

0:36:23.550,0:36:27.320
could have gone wrong and unfortunately

0:36:25.200,0:36:29.580
for Stacy is the one that does go wrong

0:36:27.320,0:36:31.830
she lets go of a shape way too early

0:36:29.580,0:36:33.690
they're loose in the lower back bending

0:36:31.830,0:36:36.090
the knees she's gonna get thumped by the

0:36:33.690,0:36:37.920
judges on that the marks will be very

0:36:36.090,0:36:39.420
low here's the drop down cam just

0:36:37.920,0:36:43.040
showing where all goes wrong there we

0:36:39.420,0:36:45.240
are that isn't gonna be very nice either

0:36:43.040,0:36:48.240
scoreboard Stacy had to walk away about

0:36:45.240,0:36:51.870
a year twenty nine point seven zero any

0:36:48.240,0:36:53.310
of those threes count agony for her I

0:36:51.870,0:36:55.980
think good thing is it's not a big field

0:36:53.310,0:36:58.530
so there is time to repair the damage

0:36:55.980,0:37:01.020
and the people of course good for Terron

0:36:58.530,0:37:04.650
their dives come back here Italy back

0:37:01.020,0:37:09.990
two and a half somersaults with pike two

0:37:04.650,0:37:12.270
point nine threes yet yet playing it

0:37:09.990,0:37:15.120
safe we saw Stacy Powell former team GP

0:37:12.270,0:37:17.400
DEP ending her back three and a half

0:37:15.120,0:37:20.370
which is an option in this backward

0:37:17.400,0:37:23.760
movement group very very short backed in

0:37:20.370,0:37:26.700
here playing safe and it proves a better

0:37:23.760,0:37:28.710
gamble they'll get mid-60s very tidy

0:37:26.700,0:37:34.590
only two point nine degree of difficulty

0:37:28.710,0:37:36.590
but it performed very well indeed that

0:37:34.590,0:37:39.060
super-slow-motion

0:37:36.590,0:37:41.700
difficult so he zoomed in that foul on

0:37:39.060,0:37:45.780
the diver we get an idea of what's going

0:37:41.700,0:37:48.330
on solid from back heat sixty five point

0:37:45.780,0:37:50.070
two five will do her power of good in

0:37:48.330,0:37:54.740
terms of getting that top at eighteen

0:37:50.070,0:37:59.730
place now to a Christian step of Germany

0:37:54.740,0:38:00.270
was in the threes three point two on his

0:37:59.730,0:38:01.920
back

0:38:00.270,0:38:03.750
two-and-a-half somersaults one half

0:38:01.920,0:38:06.570
twists performed in the pike position

0:38:03.750,0:38:08.940
she needs a few points she's back in

0:38:06.570,0:38:10.580
twenty second after a fairly poor first

0:38:08.940,0:38:13.610
round dive

0:38:10.580,0:38:15.650
well right on cue she required some more

0:38:13.610,0:38:17.900
points and this is the dive to do it on

0:38:15.650,0:38:20.720
her most difficult in the program three

0:38:17.900,0:38:21.710
point two degree of difficulty near poor

0:38:20.720,0:38:24.560
opening inwards

0:38:21.710,0:38:26.120
actually this heavily strapped up there

0:38:24.560,0:38:28.940
but didn't seem to affect her entry into

0:38:26.120,0:38:32.180
the water one and a half twist two and a

0:38:28.940,0:38:34.040
half somersaults and then yeah sneaks it

0:38:32.180,0:38:36.280
in there with a rip entry that will help

0:38:34.040,0:38:40.880
her right

0:38:36.280,0:38:45.890
seven point five a smile and all nod at

0:38:40.880,0:38:50.830
the coach and seventy-two for stir money

0:38:45.890,0:38:54.470
planning its mouth equal after round one

0:38:50.830,0:38:56.990
she has gone from a high tariffs dive to

0:38:54.470,0:39:00.020
start up with to a much more low tariffs

0:38:56.990,0:39:02.060
dive for round two and taking all the

0:39:00.020,0:39:04.550
time that she can for preparation is

0:39:02.060,0:39:05.990
there a time limit you know under the

0:39:04.550,0:39:07.430
referees discretion that's right but the

0:39:05.990,0:39:10.850
referees only just blown the whistle now

0:39:07.430,0:39:12.140
so he has money we'll have as much time

0:39:10.850,0:39:14.300
as she needs within reason if the

0:39:12.140,0:39:17.120
referee think she's taking too long they

0:39:14.300,0:39:19.100
can restart no in words

0:39:17.120,0:39:21.580
two and a half somersaults with Mike two

0:39:19.100,0:39:21.580
point eight

0:39:34.130,0:39:38.420
oh it's very good I was holding my

0:39:36.979,0:39:40.970
breath then the reason being is that

0:39:38.420,0:39:43.339
this particular move of dive is the dive

0:39:40.970,0:39:45.049
that money dramatically last year hits

0:39:43.339,0:39:46.190
her head on the diving board it was a

0:39:45.049,0:39:48.200
different dive to this one it is the

0:39:46.190,0:39:50.239
inward three and a half she hit her head

0:39:48.200,0:39:51.529
on the diving board and needed to be

0:39:50.239,0:39:53.420
rescued from the bottom of the pool

0:39:51.529,0:39:55.220
unconscious in Russia by a teammate

0:39:53.420,0:39:57.349
Nikolas and Robertson Baker fortunately

0:39:55.220,0:39:59.660
she's made this amazing comeback now

0:39:57.349,0:40:01.099
this dive that she's been performing

0:39:59.660,0:40:02.509
instead in with two-and-a-half in the

0:40:01.099,0:40:03.920
pipe position you feet could come a

0:40:02.509,0:40:05.960
little bit close and she has been

0:40:03.920,0:40:07.489
hitting her feet in training so it's

0:40:05.960,0:40:09.559
been a really tough time you can see the

0:40:07.489,0:40:12.380
relief on her face there sevens across

0:40:09.559,0:40:15.979
the board oh look I've got away with

0:40:12.380,0:40:18.529
that one sevens and fifty-eight cuz the

0:40:15.979,0:40:20.529
low degree of difficulty bit but up into

0:40:18.529,0:40:23.420
the top six for now

0:40:20.529,0:40:25.190
who you Dan the sixteen year old from

0:40:23.420,0:40:33.079
China in with three and a half we tuck

0:40:25.190,0:40:35.420
3.2 for her second dive oh it's good

0:40:33.079,0:40:37.160
entry but it is over so I say good entry

0:40:35.420,0:40:38.719
as in clean with not very much splash

0:40:37.160,0:40:41.210
look at Rumi shower they're saying look

0:40:38.719,0:40:42.410
she went flying over and yes she did we

0:40:41.210,0:40:44.539
should come up here and provide the

0:40:42.410,0:40:45.890
commentary here we are in with

0:40:44.539,0:40:47.299
three-and-a-half in the Tuck position

0:40:45.890,0:40:49.190
nothing wrong with that tuck position

0:40:47.299,0:40:51.319
there she goes woo arching in the lower

0:40:49.190,0:40:54.160
back over she goes that'll get sevens I

0:40:51.319,0:40:57.380
think well they should get sevens

0:40:54.160,0:41:01.309
because yeah it's a shame really she did

0:40:57.380,0:41:02.930
all the hard work on sevens eight and

0:41:01.309,0:41:08.690
seven point five ins has been great

0:41:02.930,0:41:15.489
pleasure working with you now on to Kim

0:41:08.690,0:41:15.489
on yang the People's Republic of Korea

0:41:20.090,0:41:25.550
in with three and a half we're TUC 3.2

0:41:23.230,0:41:28.490
again and a little bit of ground to make

0:41:25.550,0:41:31.630
up after that - that's an auspicious

0:41:28.490,0:41:31.630
start shall we say

0:41:38.039,0:41:43.289
well that's a better second round I've

0:41:40.329,0:41:45.809
should having a good think about it

0:41:43.289,0:41:48.519
drivers balancing on their tiptoes

0:41:45.809,0:41:49.930
interns not to be so sensible to hang

0:41:48.519,0:41:53.039
around for too long your legs can get

0:41:49.930,0:41:54.279
tired just on your tiptoes is it work

0:41:53.039,0:41:57.220
anyway

0:41:54.279,0:41:59.769
Kym making a better effort on this

0:41:57.220,0:42:00.789
second round divert in with three and a

0:41:59.769,0:42:02.769
half your hair comes pretty close

0:42:00.789,0:42:03.940
doesn't it he never very far away that's

0:42:02.769,0:42:05.230
a little bit too close we're just

0:42:03.940,0:42:07.750
talking about money cladding hitting a

0:42:05.230,0:42:08.140
head you can see how it happens there we

0:42:07.750,0:42:09.819
go

0:42:08.140,0:42:11.619
hands up how many of you at home have

0:42:09.819,0:42:13.950
recoiled on a couple of those dives

0:42:11.619,0:42:16.869
tonight because that is immensely close

0:42:13.950,0:42:20.049
and that concrete is unforgiving as my

0:42:16.869,0:42:24.250
glaring found out in Russia now on to

0:42:20.049,0:42:26.589
Brittany roben of Australia in were

0:42:24.250,0:42:32.740
three and a half for her as well tuck

0:42:26.589,0:42:35.069
position three point two well that's

0:42:32.740,0:42:37.960
such a shame the area work is very good

0:42:35.069,0:42:40.089
she was completing the dive with ease in

0:42:37.960,0:42:41.650
fact and then she just maybe panicked a

0:42:40.089,0:42:42.789
little bit and comes out at the dive a

0:42:41.650,0:42:45.009
little bit earlier that's the safe

0:42:42.789,0:42:46.450
distance from the diving board and then

0:42:45.009,0:42:48.700
just stretches forward a little bit too

0:42:46.450,0:42:50.680
much ending short of vertical there so

0:42:48.700,0:42:52.269
six and a half's probably which is a

0:42:50.680,0:42:53.619
shame because if she waited in a touch

0:42:52.269,0:43:01.059
tape a little bit longer she'd have been

0:42:53.619,0:43:04.299
on for eight maybe twenty three marks to

0:43:01.059,0:43:08.490
be calibrated calculated and put on the

0:43:04.299,0:43:13.529
scoreboard 6.5 raw brittany broman and

0:43:08.490,0:43:13.529
sixty two point four zero the total mark

0:43:13.589,0:43:21.779
moving up from a position of ten that

0:43:16.299,0:43:24.220
around one brenda spazzy ani of Italy

0:43:21.779,0:43:29.039
for three and a half summer sorts with

0:43:24.220,0:43:29.039
Pike 3.0

0:43:31.720,0:43:37.880
just finishing short she goes in there

0:43:34.569,0:43:40.819
it's a difficult dive 3.0 you need to

0:43:37.880,0:43:42.020
really attack the takeoff Brenda does

0:43:40.819,0:43:43.490
attack you she doesn't quite get in a

0:43:42.020,0:43:44.930
pike shape you see you can see there's

0:43:43.490,0:43:47.119
some daylight in between her thighs and

0:43:44.930,0:43:48.589
chess set needs to squeeze in a little

0:43:47.119,0:43:51.140
bit tighter in order to make the dive

0:43:48.589,0:43:55.160
with ease and give her a chance to get

0:43:51.140,0:43:58.220
that entry right and the marks please

0:43:55.160,0:44:00.500
judges can we have now a six point zero

0:43:58.220,0:44:03.380
right across the board times three

0:44:00.500,0:44:04.789
working out basic maths for you this

0:44:03.380,0:44:08.630
time 54

0:44:04.789,0:44:10.690
here's her total mark right arm stand

0:44:08.630,0:44:14.180
time oh goody

0:44:10.690,0:44:16.670
hey back triple somersault with tuck

0:44:14.180,0:44:19.430
three point three the degree of

0:44:16.670,0:44:23.599
difficulty again I think we might find

0:44:19.430,0:44:28.119
that those are Fernandez might just take

0:44:23.599,0:44:31.900
a little while over this step right

0:44:28.119,0:44:31.900
hands positions right

0:44:32.530,0:44:38.190
and wait until she's in solid position

0:44:38.340,0:44:48.910
wavering a bit ready to go she does a

0:44:45.790,0:44:53.020
good job of course the she's under the

0:44:48.910,0:44:55.300
judges rather the judges are actually

0:44:53.020,0:44:57.280
judging her right from the you know soon

0:44:55.300,0:44:59.170
as the referee's whistle goes so soon as

0:44:57.280,0:45:00.580
she starts to lift up you know she's

0:44:59.170,0:45:02.620
wobbling around the judges will see that

0:45:00.580,0:45:04.900
and they could take off some some marks

0:45:02.620,0:45:07.000
for not showing control but she seemed

0:45:04.900,0:45:09.280
pretty controlled to me and in the dive

0:45:07.000,0:45:11.940
a little bit short but it's a big degree

0:45:09.280,0:45:14.200
of difficulty is a difficult dive

0:45:11.940,0:45:15.790
holding on to a top of a kneecap so she

0:45:14.200,0:45:17.860
that's very well to stay in a tux shape

0:45:15.790,0:45:22.810
thrown up too much splash 4/8 but sevens

0:45:17.860,0:45:24.610
maybe it is sevens and a 6.5 just as

0:45:22.810,0:45:26.500
being quite tight on their scoring

0:45:24.610,0:45:29.320
tonight for the most part sixty seven

0:45:26.500,0:45:32.880
point six five four Mendoza and then

0:45:29.320,0:45:36.010
this it's not gonna hide away now

0:45:32.880,0:45:38.260
Roslin fiddy up back three and a half

0:45:36.010,0:45:41.290
somersaults with tuck three point three

0:45:38.260,0:45:44.470
saving her arm Santa a little bit later

0:45:41.290,0:45:49.870
just inside that cut off of the top 18

0:45:44.470,0:45:51.280
in 17th oh yeah indeed it was a big dive

0:45:49.870,0:45:53.170
and we've seen a couple of the girls

0:45:51.280,0:45:55.510
faltering on this one Stacy Powell is an

0:45:53.170,0:45:57.640
example this time Rosaline actually

0:45:55.510,0:45:59.830
hanging on to a touch shape long enough

0:45:57.640,0:46:01.390
she's running out of room holding on to

0:45:59.830,0:46:03.370
the tops of her knees there she pops her

0:46:01.390,0:46:04.720
feet right upper chest tips over tries

0:46:03.370,0:46:07.240
to save it by bending your knees and

0:46:04.720,0:46:09.220
then causes a bit of a boom water-wise

0:46:07.240,0:46:11.230
as she goes in that's not going to get

0:46:09.220,0:46:15.400
too much over fifty points at that level

0:46:11.230,0:46:18.640
or interesting Roslyn filly on shaky in

0:46:15.400,0:46:20.920
the room that boom five point five and a

0:46:18.640,0:46:24.750
four point five for the Canadian not

0:46:20.920,0:46:28.230
quite what she wanted at this stage

0:46:24.750,0:46:32.070
on - Melissa Wu of Australia

0:46:28.230,0:46:34.050
it's armstand time everybody back double

0:46:32.070,0:46:36.060
somersault one and a half twists free

0:46:34.050,0:46:38.880
position explain that very quickly on

0:46:36.060,0:46:40.830
free position yeah when the dive isn't

0:46:38.880,0:46:43.170
diver isn't rotating for more than one

0:46:40.830,0:46:44.460
somersault of a twist it means a free

0:46:43.170,0:46:45.540
position so you don't actually hold a

0:46:44.460,0:46:46.200
position for more than a half a

0:46:45.540,0:46:49.140
somersault

0:46:46.200,0:46:50.340
so you see Melissa stay relatively

0:46:49.140,0:46:52.560
straight throughout this and then just

0:46:50.340,0:46:55.800
re Pike on the finish to enter the water

0:46:52.560,0:46:58.349
three point two degree of difficulty no

0:46:55.800,0:47:01.710
she does a really superb job on that

0:46:58.349,0:47:03.300
finish yep there's a lot going on you're

0:47:01.710,0:47:05.040
flicking off your hands one and a half

0:47:03.300,0:47:06.780
twist double somersault it's a lot to

0:47:05.040,0:47:08.160
get in in such a short amount of time

0:47:06.780,0:47:09.660
there's a one and a half twist

0:47:08.160,0:47:12.270
Reed pikes there we are the free

0:47:09.660,0:47:14.730
position and very tidy and that's gonna

0:47:12.270,0:47:20.369
get eight and that's gonna move her up

0:47:14.730,0:47:23.220
the field see what the total mark is

0:47:20.369,0:47:24.810
after a 72 to start she finds that with

0:47:23.220,0:47:28.950
a seventy six point eight zero quite

0:47:24.810,0:47:36.830
solid from Wu and she is up to third

0:47:28.950,0:47:40.619
place right now - Maria Cayo Germany

0:47:36.830,0:47:42.180
three point two arm stand back a double

0:47:40.619,0:47:44.700
somersault one half twist again in the

0:47:42.180,0:47:46.470
free position I've seen that an awful

0:47:44.700,0:47:49.470
lot another dive competition so I

0:47:46.470,0:47:53.400
thought we just under my it's not tuck

0:47:49.470,0:47:55.820
or pike say it slowly let me say puck

0:47:53.400,0:47:55.820
and Tyco

0:48:00.770,0:48:05.520
it's a good dive I'm running out of room

0:48:04.080,0:48:07.890
a little bit she goes into there's a

0:48:05.520,0:48:09.390
little bit scruffy here we are bending

0:48:07.890,0:48:11.910
the arms trying to flick up generate

0:48:09.390,0:48:15.000
height from the arms as you can see here

0:48:11.910,0:48:16.350
it's good you know I'm probably being a

0:48:15.000,0:48:19.290
little unfair she did have time to

0:48:16.350,0:48:21.120
finish it off properly it'll get sevens

0:48:19.290,0:48:23.340
not all that's better than her first

0:48:21.120,0:48:25.170
round effort and she'll be pleased with

0:48:23.340,0:48:27.450
it's a great shot from above here look

0:48:25.170,0:48:28.560
at that even in slow motion the divers

0:48:27.450,0:48:30.600
hit the water fast don't they

0:48:28.560,0:48:32.580
it looks more than 30 feet doesn't it

0:48:30.600,0:48:34.500
when they leap off the board like that

0:48:32.580,0:48:43.670
suppose win it they're going up this is

0:48:34.500,0:48:48.000
more than 33 feet isn't it yes now and

0:48:43.670,0:48:53.450
pang of Malaysia for the big stakes yet

0:48:48.000,0:48:55.400
2.9 back two and a half with pike you're

0:48:53.450,0:48:57.510
beautiful

0:48:55.400,0:48:59.070
cruising opting for the back two and

0:48:57.510,0:49:00.420
half pipes she could easily make back

0:48:59.070,0:49:03.540
three and a half but she's opting for

0:49:00.420,0:49:05.160
the easier one here we go up into the

0:49:03.540,0:49:06.990
pike shape that beautiful Pike shape

0:49:05.160,0:49:08.790
spotting the water pointing a toes right

0:49:06.990,0:49:11.220
time making the dive looks so beautiful

0:49:08.790,0:49:12.510
and it works out for her my opinion

0:49:11.220,0:49:17.810
that's worth a nine and there's a

0:49:12.510,0:49:20.460
beautiful dive now let's see whether

0:49:17.810,0:49:22.020
neons thoughts are transmitted to the

0:49:20.460,0:49:24.510
judges on the far side have just

0:49:22.020,0:49:27.240
inputted their scores just coming up on

0:49:24.510,0:49:30.420
the scoreboard our rights

0:49:27.240,0:49:32.190
and coming up on your score poor now on

0:49:30.420,0:49:39.780
your screen seventy five point four zero

0:49:32.190,0:49:43.790
nines what she is given him Janaki

0:49:39.780,0:49:46.140
Oh career he was Republic of Korea

0:49:43.790,0:49:58.349
inward three and a half summer sorts

0:49:46.140,0:50:00.810
with tucky 3.24 fast around 100 well she

0:49:58.349,0:50:02.609
won't be forth after vine to falling

0:50:00.810,0:50:03.810
away from the diving board way too far

0:50:02.609,0:50:05.490
there which makes it difficult it's

0:50:03.810,0:50:07.410
almost like a trap door open does she

0:50:05.490,0:50:09.180
take took off from the diving board and

0:50:07.410,0:50:11.970
there she goes disappearing through the

0:50:09.180,0:50:13.770
trapdoor running out of room and then

0:50:11.970,0:50:15.359
doesn't quite says two bikes at the

0:50:13.770,0:50:16.920
cherry as she tries to come out of the

0:50:15.359,0:50:19.050
dive straightening from the hips and

0:50:16.920,0:50:20.550
then from the knees yeah the judges will

0:50:19.050,0:50:22.400
go to town on that one and won't give

0:50:20.550,0:50:25.320
her very good marks at all

0:50:22.400,0:50:27.210
which in a rather strange fashion there

0:50:25.320,0:50:30.619
the knees were bent this year she went

0:50:27.210,0:50:32.970
in slightly a rakish angle judges a

0:50:30.619,0:50:34.890
disagreement two up to four point five

0:50:32.970,0:50:37.589
on the screen there were only the top

0:50:34.890,0:50:40.920
and bottom marks will count work out

0:50:37.589,0:50:45.330
through middle ones that will Rivera off

0:50:40.920,0:50:47.700
Cuba well such a shame she's got great

0:50:45.330,0:50:49.530
aerial work she gets these dives moving

0:50:47.700,0:50:51.480
and she doesn't seem to have very much

0:50:49.530,0:50:52.830
an idea where she is now that could be a

0:50:51.480,0:50:54.480
big problem when you're diving you need

0:50:52.830,0:50:54.660
to know pretty much exactly where you

0:50:54.480,0:50:57.060
are

0:50:54.660,0:51:00.330
proprioception and kinesthetic feedback

0:50:57.060,0:51:02.670
ie where you are in relation to the

0:51:00.330,0:51:04.710
water in this case anyway she's in and

0:51:02.670,0:51:06.420
over lots of splash coming up and that

0:51:04.710,0:51:11.460
puts head right at the bottom of the

0:51:06.420,0:51:13.800
pack you have just Union you're not

0:51:11.460,0:51:15.140
listen to the Open University worse than

0:51:13.800,0:51:16.759
they come from

0:51:15.140,0:51:19.359
they're real words you could look about

0:51:16.759,0:51:20.749
if you want in your dictionary again

0:51:19.359,0:51:24.680
Rivera

0:51:20.749,0:51:27.640
54 remarks takes her to only 19th of the

0:51:24.680,0:51:33.650
moment it's not gonna do it for her for

0:51:27.640,0:51:35.329
qualification Tracy took yet of Malaysia

0:51:33.650,0:51:39.680
in with three and a half somersaults

0:51:35.329,0:51:41.869
with tuck 3.20 over she goes we're gonna

0:51:39.680,0:51:44.480
see this a little bit the girls out

0:51:41.869,0:51:45.950
there today they've got such complex

0:51:44.480,0:51:48.109
dives to do and when you're doing such

0:51:45.950,0:51:50.630
complex dives they can easily go wrong

0:51:48.109,0:51:52.910
and Tracy here just unfortunately

0:51:50.630,0:51:56.079
letting that dive go on the end there

0:51:52.910,0:51:58.789
over you can see the splash going back

0:51:56.079,0:52:00.680
almost said surfboards which I think you

0:51:58.789,0:52:02.210
might need to explain the drinkie gape

0:52:00.680,0:52:03.950
of there's some confusion I think

0:52:02.210,0:52:06.200
there's some of my second Anna fine I

0:52:03.950,0:52:07.670
think there's some of my my diet my

0:52:06.200,0:52:09.259
commentary finds out they have designed

0:52:07.670,0:52:10.880
a drinking game with some of my more

0:52:09.259,0:52:12.920
frequent sayings and I think get your

0:52:10.880,0:52:14.150
surfboards I is one of them so I think

0:52:12.920,0:52:16.400
that's a drink for those of you playing

0:52:14.150,0:52:19.609
at home have you worried too tiddly by

0:52:16.400,0:52:22.400
the end of this competition now on to

0:52:19.609,0:52:23.720
the American Katie Bell let's see what

0:52:22.400,0:52:25.489
she does in terms of preparation this

0:52:23.720,0:52:33.160
time she's talking to herself smiling to

0:52:25.489,0:52:33.160
herself a right old chatter she's saying

0:52:36.840,0:52:42.390
yeah

0:52:39.240,0:52:47.790
yes yes yeah five six seven eight it's

0:52:42.390,0:52:50.430
Sesame Street oh it's a difficult dive

0:52:47.790,0:52:51.869
as well reverse two and a half not in

0:52:50.430,0:52:53.609
the tuck position but in the pike

0:52:51.869,0:52:55.830
position so it carries a higher degree

0:52:53.609,0:52:57.750
of difficulty than the Tuck position so

0:52:55.830,0:52:59.250
it's two point nine I think you should

0:52:57.750,0:53:00.750
be worth more than this two point nine

0:52:59.250,0:53:02.400
because that's really tricky you're

0:53:00.750,0:53:04.980
jumping away spinning backwards

0:53:02.400,0:53:06.690
it makes me well shift in my chair every

0:53:04.980,0:53:08.970
time I watch a diver perform this dive

0:53:06.690,0:53:11.520
Katie just leaving it short they're

0:53:08.970,0:53:12.990
running out of space to squeeze the dive

0:53:11.520,0:53:15.420
in you can see the splash moving away

0:53:12.990,0:53:17.130
from the diving board see the diver here

0:53:15.420,0:53:20.339
moving the arms to the side with all

0:53:17.130,0:53:22.230
that air coming down trying to you know

0:53:20.339,0:53:23.910
cause that suction for the river entry

0:53:22.230,0:53:27.990
not quite working for Bell no she hasn't

0:53:23.910,0:53:29.040
got it going yet five point five is six

0:53:27.990,0:53:31.290
but that doesn't count

0:53:29.040,0:53:33.300
that's not the market she really wanted

0:53:31.290,0:53:35.010
I from the first round all the second

0:53:33.300,0:53:39.060
round she finds herself cast adrift in

0:53:35.010,0:53:40.589
21st not seeing anything about Espinoza

0:53:39.060,0:53:44.070
Sanchez now after putting the mouth on

0:53:40.589,0:53:48.050
her in the first round so to speak back

0:53:44.070,0:53:48.050
three and a half seven sorts with tuck I

0:53:49.040,0:53:53.700
think you'll continuing to do that by

0:53:51.240,0:53:56.099
just suggesting it Bob she is all over

0:53:53.700,0:53:58.109
the shop Wow I was watching training she

0:53:56.099,0:54:00.660
looked on silver medal earlier this well

0:53:58.109,0:54:03.990
last week now in the synchronized 10

0:54:00.660,0:54:05.520
meter and for a world medalist this

0:54:03.990,0:54:07.349
isn't very good at all

0:54:05.520,0:54:10.109
the aerial works good and that is way

0:54:07.349,0:54:14.820
over loads of splash she's only gonna

0:54:10.109,0:54:16.680
get fours that best Wow three dives to

0:54:14.820,0:54:18.510
go I don't know that's too much to burn

0:54:16.680,0:54:21.180
OSHA I think she can come back but Wow

0:54:18.510,0:54:23.390
yeah she should be out if she's got some

0:54:21.180,0:54:26.040
big dive still to come but 20th place

0:54:23.390,0:54:28.740
not were expected the bronze medalists

0:54:26.040,0:54:30.510
from Shanghai to beat at this stage of

0:54:28.740,0:54:33.089
the competition that was only 12 months

0:54:30.510,0:54:37.650
ago or so she won that bronze medal in

0:54:33.089,0:54:43.820
the world championships Junior gotten

0:54:37.650,0:54:43.820
over Russia in the back three and a half

0:54:45.600,0:54:50.260
she needed a ten and a half metre

0:54:47.830,0:54:52.030
platform to get that dive in there this

0:54:50.260,0:54:53.920
is the risk you run well but I have

0:54:52.030,0:54:55.870
these conversation why do some people go

0:54:53.920,0:54:57.580
for the lower degree of difficulty well

0:54:55.870,0:55:00.460
this is why because the higher degree of

0:54:57.580,0:55:02.350
difficulty carries so much risk there we

0:55:00.460,0:55:04.720
go just hitting the water bond the back

0:55:02.350,0:55:06.670
it feels like a bat around the back of

0:55:04.720,0:55:08.830
the head as you go in there oh your

0:55:06.670,0:55:10.960
shoulders are sore it's like a car crash

0:55:08.830,0:55:12.400
or being pulled to the side well she's

0:55:10.960,0:55:13.810
made a tough stuff doesn't seem to

0:55:12.400,0:55:15.370
flinch but that will hurt tomorrow

0:55:13.810,0:55:17.020
morning for sure I think the marks will

0:55:15.370,0:55:17.380
hurt more than the actual entry into the

0:55:17.020,0:55:21.130
water

0:55:17.380,0:55:26.230
not sure only forty seven point eight

0:55:21.130,0:55:29.560
five four I'll turn over like a cow up

0:55:26.230,0:55:30.850
of Japan for a slight variance in what

0:55:29.560,0:55:34.120
we've seen so let's give lot in the

0:55:30.850,0:55:38.740
first round other divers forward three

0:55:34.120,0:55:41.590
and a half summer sorts with pike noir

0:55:38.740,0:55:44.670
beautiful rep entry into the water from

0:55:41.590,0:55:47.770
Nakagawa they like it the fans

0:55:44.670,0:55:50.670
supporters and family here make shouting

0:55:47.770,0:55:53.230
and screaming that's a very good dive

0:55:50.670,0:55:54.850
yeah look at that pike shape her Chin's

0:55:53.230,0:55:56.230
almost on a rang course it's incredible

0:55:54.850,0:55:59.680
the flexibility in some of these girls

0:55:56.230,0:56:01.710
spines and bodies makes a dive very easy

0:55:59.680,0:56:04.150
you can get into a tight pipe shape and

0:56:01.710,0:56:07.960
Nakagawa it's certainly doing that with

0:56:04.150,0:56:10.720
an entry to boot backs up a 70 1.40 with

0:56:07.960,0:56:13.240
a 72 and she goes on like that she'll be

0:56:10.720,0:56:19.030
comfortably into the top 18 for the

0:56:13.240,0:56:21.790
semi-final Kim off career however he's

0:56:19.030,0:56:25.570
not in that kind of realm at the moment

0:56:21.790,0:56:28.359
twenty-sixth with that in with three and

0:56:25.570,0:56:31.450
a half again 3.2

0:56:28.359,0:56:33.099
well the youngest competitor certainly

0:56:31.450,0:56:35.109
showing him in experience here today was

0:56:33.099,0:56:37.119
watching training and actually you know

0:56:35.109,0:56:39.369
she's always going to struggle it's a

0:56:37.119,0:56:41.109
big ask at such a tender age to be

0:56:39.369,0:56:42.519
coming into an Olympic Games and

0:56:41.109,0:56:45.489
performing these dives and that's a

0:56:42.519,0:56:47.140
particularly difficult 13.2 she's got

0:56:45.489,0:56:48.579
even more difficult one next round so

0:56:47.140,0:56:51.309
I'll be holding my breath when she does

0:56:48.579,0:56:53.849
that one hoping that she is okay and

0:56:51.309,0:56:59.650
yeah that isn't gonna be good

0:56:53.849,0:57:03.609
26 for Kim after the second round I've

0:56:59.650,0:57:06.190
seen a lot of 4.5 today not gonna help

0:57:03.609,0:57:09.309
the progression of those who give her a

0:57:06.190,0:57:10.930
top 18 place these are the divers who

0:57:09.309,0:57:15.609
are very safe and with a bit of room for

0:57:10.930,0:57:18.849
error I benefited a good start Chen has

0:57:15.609,0:57:21.609
my list of whoo my down to nine or in

0:57:18.849,0:57:25.630
reasonably comfortable territory it's a

0:57:21.609,0:57:28.569
little bit tighter up to 18 or in

0:57:25.630,0:57:30.130
including Monica cladding of Great

0:57:28.569,0:57:32.890
Britain Rosalie and Finlay on in the

0:57:30.130,0:57:35.079
last position at the moment and these

0:57:32.890,0:57:40.900
are the ones on the next page and we're

0:57:35.079,0:57:45.400
gonna have little work to do down to

0:57:40.900,0:57:49.829
Stacey Powell in 25th and Kim of career

0:57:45.400,0:57:52.900
in 26 kg belt Stacey Powell and Kim

0:57:49.829,0:57:55.499
master drift a little bit not at three

0:57:52.900,0:57:55.499
figures yet

0:57:59.310,0:58:05.720
stacy pal I was plating her dive in

0:58:03.180,0:58:05.720
round three

0:58:07.980,0:58:15.300
and here is round three of the women's

0:58:11.369,0:58:17.820
10 metre platform preliminary top 18 go

0:58:15.300,0:58:20.300
through to the semi-final top 12 then to

0:58:17.820,0:58:23.339
the final at the moment

0:58:20.300,0:58:26.730
Brittany viola is comfortable in 6th

0:58:23.339,0:58:28.050
place after her first two rounds she's

0:58:26.730,0:58:32.130
gonna here for an inward three and a

0:58:28.050,0:58:37.099
half samasource with tuck in round 3 Sun

0:58:32.130,0:58:37.099
off the divers in this competition

0:58:42.050,0:58:46.710
well shame really all she needed to do

0:58:44.820,0:58:47.790
was straighten out a little bit more she

0:58:46.710,0:58:50.640
went into the water

0:58:47.790,0:58:54.330
great Brittany says the banner not quite

0:58:50.640,0:58:56.250
great enough on that dive every work is

0:58:54.330,0:58:58.680
good squeezing into that touch sit quite

0:58:56.250,0:58:59.970
near the diving board and then does it

0:58:58.680,0:59:01.590
quite straight now and you can see the

0:58:59.970,0:59:02.790
backside just poking out a little bit

0:59:01.590,0:59:05.030
there if she just straightened out more

0:59:02.790,0:59:08.100
she went in she'd get more than sixes

0:59:05.030,0:59:09.600
6.5 you know she was running a little

0:59:08.100,0:59:12.210
bit higher but again for Louise it's

0:59:09.600,0:59:16.200
just about making it through mmm

0:59:12.210,0:59:22.020
Brittany oh baby baby 6 is fifty-seven

0:59:16.200,0:59:28.050
point six zero for Brittany viola Audrey

0:59:22.020,0:59:30.000
LeBeau France occupying 16th place which

0:59:28.050,0:59:31.460
will be good enough if she retains out

0:59:30.000,0:59:34.980
for the next three rounds

0:59:31.460,0:59:36.960
first of all you've been proving to be a

0:59:34.980,0:59:39.390
little bit problematic so far in the

0:59:36.960,0:59:43.950
competition and she has hers right now

0:59:39.390,0:59:46.860
arm stand back double somersault one and

0:59:43.950,0:59:51.420
a half twists three point to the degree

0:59:46.860,0:59:53.550
of difficulty well it's a good tie from

0:59:51.420,0:59:55.800
Audrey just over rotating as she goes in

0:59:53.550,0:59:57.300
and some of you may have seen as Audrey

0:59:55.800,0:59:58.950
was lifting up into the handstand there

0:59:57.300,1:00:00.810
was a technical official on the back of

0:59:58.950,1:00:03.390
the 10 meter board there is a reason for

1:00:00.810,1:00:05.040
this because if the diver doesn't get up

1:00:03.390,1:00:06.960
into the handstand successfully first

1:00:05.040,1:00:08.730
time and they come down that's a

1:00:06.960,1:00:10.920
technical fault it actually becomes a

1:00:08.730,1:00:13.020
restart so the technical official at the

1:00:10.920,1:00:15.510
top of the 10 meter is there to make

1:00:13.020,1:00:17.430
sure that the athlete does not restart

1:00:15.510,1:00:19.230
it's important part it's part of the

1:00:17.430,1:00:20.310
FINA rules I know some of you have been

1:00:19.230,1:00:22.020
questioning that whether it's off

1:00:20.310,1:00:24.000
putting the technical official stands to

1:00:22.020,1:00:27.090
the side out of the way hope that

1:00:24.000,1:00:28.680
explains that focal 160 2.40 as we

1:00:27.090,1:00:30.560
explain the marks for you again all the

1:00:28.680,1:00:33.920
marks without lines through them count

1:00:30.560,1:00:37.050
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

1:00:33.920,1:00:39.780
again bent feet it was had a very good

1:00:37.050,1:00:42.000
start for the mouth of her eye there

1:00:39.780,1:00:44.100
kiss to have the commentators curse

1:00:42.000,1:00:47.910
tonight in word three and half

1:00:44.100,1:00:50.230
somersaults difficulty 3.2 for the first

1:00:47.910,1:00:57.369
of the Canadians

1:00:50.230,1:00:58.960
I think you should keep quiet Bob I just

1:00:57.369,1:01:01.540
did the commentary on my own otherwise

1:00:58.960,1:01:03.460
we could see all sorts happening so make

1:01:01.540,1:01:04.630
in first two times as we mentioned very

1:01:03.460,1:01:06.310
good indeed

1:01:04.630,1:01:08.140
third round dive and I'm surprised

1:01:06.310,1:01:11.079
because this one it's actually normally

1:01:08.140,1:01:13.300
pretty solid for it she was another one

1:01:11.079,1:01:15.099
who needed an 11 meter platform that's a

1:01:13.300,1:01:18.130
real shame lost it all on the take-off

1:01:15.099,1:01:21.130
doesn't get enough spring struggles on

1:01:18.130,1:01:23.950
the rotation and then yeah the entry is

1:01:21.130,1:01:27.550
impacted negatively it's all over when

1:01:23.950,1:01:28.960
it started actually I didn't Rosen that

1:01:27.550,1:01:32.109
kind of influence but seemingly I do

1:01:28.960,1:01:34.540
fives a three point two and that has

1:01:32.109,1:01:36.070
taken a tumbling down the table but I

1:01:34.540,1:01:38.500
think she's probably done enough for the

1:01:36.070,1:01:41.770
first two rounds ourself with a bit of a

1:01:38.500,1:01:44.670
buffer and of a comfort zone margin for

1:01:41.770,1:01:49.859
round five when we get to it

1:01:44.670,1:01:55.089
general in the champion world champion

1:01:49.859,1:01:58.079
second place after round two becomes the

1:01:55.089,1:01:58.079
arm stand from her

1:02:01.550,1:02:08.069
yeah no mistakes from Shen Ruolin so

1:02:05.970,1:02:11.160
experienced and this is very very

1:02:08.069,1:02:13.560
technically proficient straight up and

1:02:11.160,1:02:14.940
down right on the money big scores

1:02:13.560,1:02:16.920
coming her way

1:02:14.940,1:02:25.200
one and a half twist straight down into

1:02:16.920,1:02:31.410
the water repent tree 98.5 at worst 3.2

1:02:25.200,1:02:33.540
equals the lead have that 10 meter board

1:02:31.410,1:02:35.010
measured to no unsafe thinking this it

1:02:33.540,1:02:36.660
might be nine and a half or ten eleven

1:02:35.010,1:02:39.380
to be working for everybody tonight it's

1:02:36.660,1:02:42.089
worked for her eighty one point six zero

1:02:39.380,1:02:43.200
and that takes her into quite a

1:02:42.089,1:02:45.960
commanding lead

1:02:43.200,1:02:47.810
of course the marks from the prelims are

1:02:45.960,1:02:50.210
not carried forward to the semi-final

1:02:47.810,1:02:53.550
just in case of earning yourself a place

1:02:50.210,1:02:58.530
you only Oprah cop shook back two and a

1:02:53.550,1:03:00.359
half well she almost had it there it all

1:02:58.530,1:03:01.950
looked good I think she just needed to

1:03:00.359,1:03:04.200
look back a little bit with her chin

1:03:01.950,1:03:06.440
sorry with it yeah lift her chin a

1:03:04.200,1:03:09.869
little bit look back at the water to

1:03:06.440,1:03:12.119
glide that dive in she just doesn't look

1:03:09.869,1:03:13.800
back far enough for me so instead of

1:03:12.119,1:03:17.280
being completely upright she's a little

1:03:13.800,1:03:19.500
bit out of shape on the end on the end

1:03:17.280,1:03:20.940
of the dive making much sense there but

1:03:19.500,1:03:22.829
I think I will on this area I've just

1:03:20.940,1:03:24.480
needed to look back a little bit more to

1:03:22.829,1:03:26.880
glide into the water with a slight back

1:03:24.480,1:03:31.650
arch for eight so 17 bit bit of a mixed

1:03:26.880,1:03:35.190
bag from the judges sixty five point two

1:03:31.650,1:03:37.950
five for the book took no Stacie Pannell

1:03:35.190,1:03:40.680
needs all the support and all the help

1:03:37.950,1:03:44.130
she can get from the home crowd because

1:03:40.680,1:03:46.440
that second round dive quite a drop dive

1:03:44.130,1:03:48.060
the attempted marks it wasn't quite what

1:03:46.440,1:03:50.670
she wanted so she hasn't got to the

1:03:48.060,1:03:53.599
three figure mark yet ninety six point

1:03:50.670,1:03:56.040
nine zero after round two

1:03:53.599,1:03:57.599
can she repair some of that damage with

1:03:56.040,1:03:59.869
a for three and a half somersaults with

1:03:57.599,1:03:59.869
pike

1:04:00.750,1:04:04.890
yeah she can repair the damage she's

1:04:02.970,1:04:07.109
gonna have to get a comeback floors I

1:04:04.890,1:04:07.920
dig them in and pull herself back into

1:04:07.109,1:04:10.020
contention

1:04:07.920,1:04:11.880
the cried certainly like it they're

1:04:10.020,1:04:14.040
looking for that repent tree and there

1:04:11.880,1:04:15.780
certainly was one on the end of that

1:04:14.040,1:04:17.550
dive little bit back from the end and

1:04:15.780,1:04:18.840
she is a little bit piked as she entered

1:04:17.550,1:04:21.750
the water so I don't think she's gonna

1:04:18.840,1:04:22.890
get ate but she certainly deserves 7.5

1:04:21.750,1:04:26.220
there's a real shame if she was

1:04:22.890,1:04:27.810
completely straight on the entry into

1:04:26.220,1:04:30.960
the water and then I think she should be

1:04:27.810,1:04:32.520
getting nines good dive from Stacey to

1:04:30.960,1:04:34.290
pull her back into it oh good

1:04:32.520,1:04:35.700
they've gone with her eight well one

1:04:34.290,1:04:37.980
seven one seven point five but they

1:04:35.700,1:04:40.230
don't count so eight two came yes Emily

1:04:37.980,1:04:41.670
to the total mark that will move her up

1:04:40.230,1:04:44.609
a spot or two she needs to be about

1:04:41.670,1:04:46.590
quite a few though she has to get eight

1:04:44.609,1:04:50.180
places to make that so many fine but

1:04:46.590,1:04:50.180
that it's not beyond redemption

1:04:50.700,1:04:56.730
onto the diaper with a Hungarian name

1:04:54.580,1:05:00.940
born in Hungary but representing Italy

1:04:56.730,1:05:03.070
there's no me back key never been beyond

1:05:00.940,1:05:06.550
the preliminaries and any major event so

1:05:03.070,1:05:08.770
far this be her turn back 2 & a half

1:05:06.550,1:05:17.050
somersaults 1 the half twists in the

1:05:08.770,1:05:18.040
pike position was the biggest I was

1:05:17.050,1:05:19.540
watching him earlier

1:05:18.040,1:05:21.220
maybe suffering a little bit of injury a

1:05:19.540,1:05:22.750
coach was given a bit of a massage in

1:05:21.220,1:05:24.100
between the shoulder blades the divers

1:05:22.750,1:05:26.230
getting ripped here there and everywhere

1:05:24.100,1:05:27.640
as they enter the water if your head

1:05:26.230,1:05:29.320
goes one way and you arm goes the other

1:05:27.640,1:05:32.320
it does feel like your shoulders being

1:05:29.320,1:05:33.910
dislocated there we are putting

1:05:32.320,1:05:35.110
themselves through all sorts of

1:05:33.910,1:05:37.990
punishment to bring you the

1:05:35.110,1:05:42.820
entertainment of the evening and that

1:05:37.990,1:05:44.620
was good from Italian yeah it's a pretty

1:05:42.820,1:05:46.120
solid mark Ashley coming up on your

1:05:44.620,1:05:48.280
screen sixty seven point two zero

1:05:46.120,1:05:51.250
certainly the in the context of this

1:05:48.280,1:05:52.390
competition if you again 67's we're so

1:05:51.250,1:05:54.100
you'd be pretty happy because it would

1:05:52.390,1:05:59.080
mean that you make it through to the

1:05:54.100,1:06:03.130
last eighteen she is on her way Kristen

1:05:59.080,1:06:06.690
Stewart of Germany in the preparation

1:06:03.130,1:06:09.940
for that 3.2 degree of difficulty dive

1:06:06.690,1:06:11.590
arm stand back double somersault one a

1:06:09.940,1:06:14.440
half twist you hear the crowd didn't

1:06:11.590,1:06:16.090
take a breath as I watch here get in the

1:06:14.440,1:06:19.420
upright position than those heavily

1:06:16.090,1:06:21.430
bandaged wrists well she just seemed to

1:06:19.420,1:06:23.710
fall off the diving board there didn't

1:06:21.430,1:06:25.990
even push with her hands just seemed to

1:06:23.710,1:06:27.880
use the momentum falling is a very

1:06:25.990,1:06:30.400
brightly coloured costume isn't it thank

1:06:27.880,1:06:34.330
you my eyes go a little bit a little bit

1:06:30.400,1:06:36.250
funny anyway the dive is good did she

1:06:34.330,1:06:38.590
show control in the balance maybe some

1:06:36.250,1:06:40.210
of the judges will you know take some

1:06:38.590,1:06:43.480
marks off for that maybe just half a

1:06:40.210,1:06:44.890
point apart from not very much height

1:06:43.480,1:06:48.030
from the hands is straight up and down

1:06:44.890,1:06:48.030
she does a good job

1:06:49.020,1:06:54.880
72 for Kristen Stewart just examining

1:06:53.319,1:06:57.579
the board only what's good have known a

1:06:54.880,1:07:00.849
bit better I think she can think about

1:06:57.579,1:07:04.839
improving on that and semi final she may

1:07:00.849,1:07:09.369
be on her way monie cladding it's in

1:07:04.839,1:07:12.460
14th place after round 2 it's time for

1:07:09.369,1:07:15.150
her arm stand it's over with money just

1:07:12.460,1:07:21.400
taking it with extra preparation time

1:07:15.150,1:07:24.069
said I've you've seen several times arm

1:07:21.400,1:07:26.440
stand back double somersault one half

1:07:24.069,1:07:29.740
twists right

1:07:26.440,1:07:32.040
intricate laborious preparation for

1:07:29.740,1:07:32.040
Maalik

1:07:48.249,1:07:54.200
well you could hear an absolute pin drop

1:07:51.049,1:07:57.410
couldn't you Monique a next gymnast from

1:07:54.200,1:07:58.999
South Africa coming in to her arm stand

1:07:57.410,1:08:01.190
as if she's on the balance beam she

1:07:58.999,1:08:02.869
comes in from the side always scares me

1:08:01.190,1:08:06.410
doing that I would never have got into

1:08:02.869,1:08:08.299
my arm standing that way she held holds

1:08:06.410,1:08:10.609
the arms done beautifully very steady

1:08:08.299,1:08:12.799
great home support just a little bit of

1:08:10.609,1:08:14.480
over votation I think she'll get away

1:08:12.799,1:08:16.759
with Sarah's look at that coming inside

1:08:14.480,1:08:18.319
on as if she's on the balance beam but

1:08:16.759,1:08:20.509
she's not she's perched on the enter the

1:08:18.319,1:08:23.330
10 meter this is such a strong jump just

1:08:20.509,1:08:24.859
giving it a little bit too much revving

1:08:23.330,1:08:28.609
the engine a little bit too hard over

1:08:24.859,1:08:32.060
rotating graduation from a Melissa whoo

1:08:28.609,1:08:34.250
they're from Australia good friends yeah

1:08:32.060,1:08:36.739
it's a fairly solid score though and in

1:08:34.250,1:08:40.520
the context of this competition may well

1:08:36.739,1:08:42.739
be good enough mid-range score and

1:08:40.520,1:08:45.370
things have been thus far mid-range

1:08:42.739,1:08:49.880
score just about gets the job done

1:08:45.370,1:08:52.029
whoo you Dan well replicate in terms of

1:08:49.880,1:08:54.380
the dive that we've just seen from Manik

1:08:52.029,1:08:58.279
three-point-two arm stand back double

1:08:54.380,1:09:01.069
somersault one and a half twists oh it's

1:08:58.279,1:09:04.850
a good entry from you Dan however she is

1:09:01.069,1:09:06.589
tipping over a vertical remember seeing

1:09:04.850,1:09:09.859
a previous two dice both of them a

1:09:06.589,1:09:12.350
little bit off on the entries so we're

1:09:09.859,1:09:13.670
see only very young as she's 16 I've

1:09:12.350,1:09:15.230
seen the dive so much better than this

1:09:13.670,1:09:16.699
I'm sure there's more to come I mean

1:09:15.230,1:09:18.830
she's going to get good marks on that

1:09:16.699,1:09:21.799
but in training I've seen this worth

1:09:18.830,1:09:23.029
nines and tens actually that's 8 mm

1:09:21.799,1:09:24.830
maybe

1:09:23.029,1:09:26.120
yeah 8 that's what I'd go for and that

1:09:24.830,1:09:27.770
judges think

1:09:26.120,1:09:29.900
exactly the way you're thinking pretty

1:09:27.770,1:09:35.299
much and there was an 8.5 it's like you

1:09:29.900,1:09:38.089
broke one in there 8 otherwise and again

1:09:35.299,1:09:40.250
as we expect the Chinese are gonna be

1:09:38.089,1:09:42.889
they are they're about at the end of

1:09:40.250,1:09:45.560
this competition now two slightly more

1:09:42.889,1:09:50.989
complicated arm stand back triple

1:09:45.560,1:09:52.170
somersault here or Kim of Korea Korea

1:09:50.989,1:10:02.460
gonna be over

1:09:52.170,1:10:04.290
this over she goes throwing up a lot of

1:10:02.460,1:10:06.510
splash the the lifting to the arm

1:10:04.290,1:10:10.530
balance into the umpires was absolutely

1:10:06.510,1:10:13.140
superb very gymnastic showing very solid

1:10:10.530,1:10:14.250
good control and then flicks off gets

1:10:13.140,1:10:17.040
into the shape it's all looking good

1:10:14.250,1:10:22.290
until there and then whoosh there's a

1:10:17.040,1:10:28.380
big tidal wave Shane look at the splash

1:10:22.290,1:10:33.360
finesse whoosh it's behind you the mark

1:10:28.380,1:10:35.900
is forty six point two zero we'll just

1:10:33.360,1:10:38.219
spread on that two point five up to five

1:10:35.900,1:10:39.810
five point five one of them two point

1:10:38.219,1:10:46.199
five to five point five eighths confuse

1:10:39.810,1:10:47.699
the judges that one befuddled if I don't

1:10:46.199,1:10:50.400
good words yeah they couldn't work it

1:10:47.699,1:10:54.000
out they might do it better on Brittany

1:10:50.400,1:10:55.410
bro burns arm stand like me a three and

1:10:54.000,1:10:57.989
a half point differential but we're

1:10:55.410,1:10:59.510
revisiting old sores and old wounds

1:10:57.989,1:11:02.400
aren't we on this one

1:10:59.510,1:11:04.650
I'm stand back double somersault one and

1:11:02.400,1:11:06.480
a half twists case you're coming in

1:11:04.650,1:11:10.830
fresh to the competition we've seen this

1:11:06.480,1:11:12.870
a lot this is the attempt by the 16 year

1:11:10.830,1:11:20.219
old Australian Brittany browbone

1:11:12.870,1:11:22.410
in round three well I'm impressed with

1:11:20.219,1:11:25.880
this young lady only 16 years old and

1:11:22.410,1:11:28.980
she's holding it together very composed

1:11:25.880,1:11:32.060
yep having a smile as well and good on

1:11:28.980,1:11:34.710
you that's what it's all about

1:11:32.060,1:11:37.650
nice well have some fun this is what you

1:11:34.710,1:11:38.580
do day in day out week after week month

1:11:37.650,1:11:40.320
after month

1:11:38.580,1:11:42.900
hour after hour now it's your time to

1:11:40.320,1:11:47.860
shine and that's three out of three for

1:11:42.900,1:11:49.780
the Aussie yeah 68-62 and 80

1:11:47.860,1:11:54.760
are happy with her and she will be happy

1:11:49.780,1:11:56.500
with that she goes up to 211 and the

1:11:54.760,1:11:57.159
well on her way three more rounds to go

1:11:56.500,1:11:58.780
of course

1:11:57.159,1:12:02.820
two more rounds to go after this it's

1:11:58.780,1:12:02.820
five in the women's six in the men's and

1:12:03.210,1:12:07.960
spazzy alley

1:12:04.860,1:12:14.639
still going for the high tariffs still

1:12:07.960,1:12:14.639
sticking in the twos 2.9 for the Italian

1:12:15.300,1:12:19.560
back two and a half soy sauce

1:12:29.550,1:12:34.360
yeah well you enjoy didn't look like she

1:12:32.739,1:12:36.340
was conducting an orchestra then just

1:12:34.360,1:12:38.110
before she took off well it's the arm

1:12:36.340,1:12:40.929
swing that she chose to use and it

1:12:38.110,1:12:42.340
seemed to be pretty effective let's have

1:12:40.929,1:12:43.840
a look at the take off I we didn't get

1:12:42.340,1:12:45.099
to see the arm swing then she's moving

1:12:43.840,1:12:46.900
sideways a little bit

1:12:45.099,1:12:48.790
none of our movement there that she

1:12:46.900,1:12:53.110
probably didn't need a bit of splash

1:12:48.790,1:12:59.710
being thrown up Oh big back arch she

1:12:53.110,1:13:00.630
takes off by Carter she goes in not the

1:12:59.710,1:13:03.130
problem still on

1:13:00.630,1:13:04.989
maybe sheets you find a job there she

1:13:03.130,1:13:12.429
doesn't qualify in here fifty two point

1:13:04.989,1:13:16.929
two zero a baton she'd be well away now

1:13:12.429,1:13:19.929
on to Karenina Hernandez he back three

1:13:16.929,1:13:21.579
and a half seven sort with tuck right at

1:13:19.929,1:13:27.610
the top of the degree of difficulty

1:13:21.579,1:13:30.610
three point three here's the DD which of

1:13:27.610,1:13:35.639
course will be multiplied by the marks

1:13:30.610,1:13:35.639
that she gets tenth after round two

1:13:39.889,1:13:42.639
when you ready

1:13:55.950,1:13:59.020
or she's having a big think about it

1:13:58.330,1:14:01.510
wasn't she

1:13:59.020,1:14:03.100
yeah people wondering well what he

1:14:01.510,1:14:06.010
taking so long for thinking it through

1:14:03.100,1:14:08.950
and potentially that could be paralysis

1:14:06.010,1:14:10.260
by analysis thinking too much trying too

1:14:08.950,1:14:12.790
hard

1:14:10.260,1:14:15.010
talk to self out of it there we go what

1:14:12.790,1:14:17.470
a shame kicking up towards the ceiling

1:14:15.010,1:14:19.510
which is way way too late the takeoff

1:14:17.470,1:14:20.950
was good every work was good staying on

1:14:19.510,1:14:22.690
the diving board I think a little bit

1:14:20.950,1:14:24.970
too long put herself off talk to herself

1:14:22.690,1:14:27.190
out of it now she's got some work to do

1:14:24.970,1:14:29.170
this young Mexican is there an ideal

1:14:27.190,1:14:31.390
length of time you take to do that

1:14:29.170,1:14:33.250
divert preference you know not too long

1:14:31.390,1:14:34.360
and if you rush too much you know you

1:14:33.250,1:14:36.760
need to give yourself time to be

1:14:34.360,1:14:38.470
composed but I think that for me was

1:14:36.760,1:14:40.090
potentially a little bit too long but

1:14:38.470,1:14:41.920
then of course if she nailed it I'd have

1:14:40.090,1:14:43.840
to eat my words mm-hmm thirty nine point

1:14:41.920,1:14:45.970
six zero though he's not a great return

1:14:43.840,1:14:49.150
on that dive early in length of time

1:14:45.970,1:14:52.960
that she considered it Rosalie and filly

1:14:49.150,1:14:55.450
on 18th now inward three and a half

1:14:52.960,1:15:03.580
summer swaps with tuck three point two

1:14:55.450,1:15:06.430
for the Canadian war she's struggling a

1:15:03.580,1:15:07.989
little bit today Alex de Partie in the

1:15:06.430,1:15:10.120
rest of the Canadian contingent there

1:15:07.989,1:15:12.280
cheering her on but she certainly needs

1:15:10.120,1:15:13.930
to lift a game that's a poor second man

1:15:12.280,1:15:16.060
dive and a poor third round dive

1:15:13.930,1:15:17.980
certainly for this young lady standards

1:15:16.060,1:15:20.440
she might get five and a half's and

1:15:17.980,1:15:21.640
sixes on this one but after a poor

1:15:20.440,1:15:25.000
second round dive it would need to be

1:15:21.640,1:15:27.340
better super-slow-motion yeah she's a

1:15:25.000,1:15:28.960
safe distance from the diving board but

1:15:27.340,1:15:31.570
not a very safe entry into the water

1:15:28.960,1:15:34.750
unfortunately yeah not quite sure what's

1:15:31.570,1:15:37.810
going on today a lot of missed dives or

1:15:34.750,1:15:40.930
times very much under par sixes they

1:15:37.810,1:15:42.790
give the judges and that's not going to

1:15:40.930,1:15:45.520
help her status a great deal she was

1:15:42.790,1:15:49.300
eighteenth of the previous round going

1:15:45.520,1:15:51.400
on others to falter here Melissa woo and

1:15:49.300,1:15:55.989
her back three and a half

1:15:51.400,1:15:58.620
we're tuck before and see how she

1:15:55.989,1:15:58.620
performs

1:15:59.350,1:16:04.820
those all going a little bit askew on

1:16:02.210,1:16:06.200
the take-off they're moving too far away

1:16:04.820,1:16:08.090
from the diving board not quite getting

1:16:06.200,1:16:09.530
your arms to on the take-off and having

1:16:08.090,1:16:10.160
a little bit of trouble to rotate here

1:16:09.530,1:16:12.560
we go look

1:16:10.160,1:16:14.060
yep needed to reach up a little bit more

1:16:12.560,1:16:16.760
before she came into a shape she was

1:16:14.060,1:16:18.680
always running out of room she does an

1:16:16.760,1:16:20.480
ok job of getting into the water there

1:16:18.680,1:16:22.550
but you can see her turning turning into

1:16:20.480,1:16:24.680
a little bit of a banana as she went in

1:16:22.550,1:16:29.750
needs to be straight and vertical as you

1:16:24.680,1:16:31.640
go in not with a big back arch that

1:16:29.750,1:16:34.280
would hurt she went in hopefully she's

1:16:31.640,1:16:36.950
okay shots now that was a banana

1:16:34.280,1:16:40.010
reference sixty two point seven zero for

1:16:36.950,1:16:43.460
Melissa whoo and at the moment with my

1:16:40.010,1:16:46.070
few holding it back to Chava the coach

1:16:43.460,1:16:53.240
going out myself as I went in she's in

1:16:46.070,1:16:55.340
2/3 back entry to think about as she

1:16:53.240,1:16:59.240
goes into round 4 here's Carillo of

1:16:55.340,1:17:00.950
Germany it were two and a half well

1:16:59.240,1:17:04.820
that's the best I've out of the three so

1:17:00.950,1:17:06.320
far from the rear for easiest dive two

1:17:04.820,1:17:08.450
point eight degree of difficulty so she

1:17:06.320,1:17:11.510
knows that she needed to make it count

1:17:08.450,1:17:13.370
and she certainly has Oh maybe touching

1:17:11.510,1:17:15.110
the toes on the diving board there these

1:17:13.370,1:17:16.970
girls it's often the case and even wood

1:17:15.110,1:17:18.680
two and a half in the pike position does

1:17:16.970,1:17:22.340
she do it will it stay with this shot oh

1:17:18.680,1:17:25.970
no she just all a toenail away with her

1:17:22.340,1:17:26.360
toenails she's glad she cut them this

1:17:25.970,1:17:30.170
morning

1:17:26.360,1:17:32.570
that could have been unfortunate seven

1:17:30.170,1:17:34.790
point five eight seven point five they

1:17:32.570,1:17:36.860
count towards the score of sixty four

1:17:34.790,1:17:39.200
point four zero remember all the marks

1:17:36.860,1:17:41.620
with lines through them do not count top

1:17:39.200,1:17:44.050
and bottom discarded the middle three

1:17:41.620,1:17:47.570
added up with the degree of difficulty

1:17:44.050,1:17:51.830
as you can see and that shot we are in

1:17:47.570,1:17:55.550
armstand territory again it's at 3.2

1:17:51.830,1:17:58.220
again and it's the back double

1:17:55.550,1:18:01.660
somersault one and a half twists around

1:17:58.220,1:18:01.660
like meat intake of breath

1:18:01.759,1:18:07.919
well she's overcooked it she cranked it

1:18:05.099,1:18:11.749
up on the start and gave it a bit too

1:18:07.919,1:18:14.339
much so diving is right being precise

1:18:11.749,1:18:15.989
she just gets after the dive a little

1:18:14.339,1:18:17.849
bit too aggressively doesn't have time

1:18:15.989,1:18:19.049
to you know to slow it down there's

1:18:17.849,1:18:21.179
nothing she could do there she was

1:18:19.049,1:18:22.589
always gonna over rotate on that needed

1:18:21.179,1:18:24.169
to flick up a little bit more with the

1:18:22.589,1:18:26.759
feet rather than flicking down

1:18:24.169,1:18:28.469
increasing the rotation nothing she

1:18:26.759,1:18:32.729
could do that mistake on the takeoff

1:18:28.469,1:18:34.559
over rotation on the end well we've

1:18:32.729,1:18:36.779
talked up a lot of the competition so

1:18:34.559,1:18:39.899
far I'd say I think this is a little bit

1:18:36.779,1:18:41.519
of a below par prelims to be honest so

1:18:39.899,1:18:43.559
we're waiting for somebody to really

1:18:41.519,1:18:49.979
bring it to life and to light up the

1:18:43.559,1:18:51.569
board becomes Kim of Korea back three

1:18:49.979,1:18:55.559
and a half somersaults with tuck three

1:18:51.569,1:18:58.499
point three degree of difficulty so that

1:18:55.559,1:19:01.169
she is a substantial distance away from

1:18:58.499,1:19:06.719
the board so the comparison beginning a

1:19:01.169,1:19:09.229
little bit too close for comfort well

1:19:06.719,1:19:11.669
she's done a really good job there I was

1:19:09.229,1:19:13.229
looking at Bob they're giving him the

1:19:11.669,1:19:15.149
sign for this could go either way

1:19:13.229,1:19:16.709
I've been watching this in training I'm

1:19:15.149,1:19:18.959
not sure whether she's gonna nail this

1:19:16.709,1:19:20.549
one or whether she could go crashing

1:19:18.959,1:19:23.159
into the water as I watch to do just

1:19:20.549,1:19:25.529
before this contest started anyway Kim

1:19:23.159,1:19:27.779
nailing her biggest dive when it counts

1:19:25.529,1:19:30.599
the back three and a half she placed a

1:19:27.779,1:19:31.559
waiting game pops her feet up directly

1:19:30.599,1:19:33.509
towards the ceiling

1:19:31.559,1:19:35.489
he should get herself some good somewhat

1:19:33.509,1:19:40.049
good marks on that one putting herself

1:19:35.489,1:19:42.329
in contention for a top eighteen spot at

1:19:40.049,1:19:44.729
the moment 70s are a very good score

1:19:42.329,1:19:46.139
you're getting 70s you are moving up the

1:19:44.729,1:19:48.299
pecking order you know starting to get

1:19:46.139,1:19:50.879
yourself in contention because they've

1:19:48.299,1:19:53.519
been so many forties and around about

1:19:50.879,1:19:58.069
that's got a few people are tailing off

1:19:53.519,1:19:58.069
here's a 2.9 from Annie Rivera

1:19:58.910,1:20:03.740
I mean that's gonna get out 20s yeah

1:20:01.790,1:20:05.780
just showing you how difficult diving is

1:20:03.740,1:20:07.100
now let's be fair we are at the Olympic

1:20:05.780,1:20:09.230
Games are watching the best of the best

1:20:07.100,1:20:11.960
and when you do it so well it almost

1:20:09.230,1:20:15.020
looks easy but let me tell you it's far

1:20:11.960,1:20:16.610
far from easy and this is example how

1:20:15.020,1:20:19.520
easy it can go wrong you've only got one

1:20:16.610,1:20:25.550
point six seconds to get your dive in in

1:20:19.520,1:20:28.130
this case not get it in 2.5 s can frayed

1:20:25.550,1:20:31.340
and the way things are panning out she

1:20:28.130,1:20:33.590
will not be returning for the semi-final

1:20:31.340,1:20:36.890
there's so many calamities today you

1:20:33.590,1:20:41.510
can't predict at this stage Tracy took

1:20:36.890,1:20:44.330
it of malaise yet a little bit more safe

1:20:41.510,1:20:47.510
with a two point nine back two and a

1:20:44.330,1:20:50.150
half summer sorts with pike 21st at the

1:20:47.510,1:20:54.680
moment I'm not returning as things stand

1:20:50.150,1:20:57.200
for all these well just a little bit

1:20:54.680,1:21:00.680
over watch the diver Anna before her we

1:20:57.200,1:21:02.390
go very very shorted vertical using the

1:21:00.680,1:21:06.950
same dive or opting for the same dive

1:21:02.390,1:21:07.460
Tracy decides to hang on longer than she

1:21:06.950,1:21:09.290
needs to

1:21:07.460,1:21:11.990
reaching over just tipping over a

1:21:09.290,1:21:17.510
vertical four and a half fives yep

1:21:11.990,1:21:19.160
she'll be way off the pace as well those

1:21:17.510,1:21:21.470
those rings as well they're good marker

1:21:19.160,1:21:23.300
for you see how far they are away from

1:21:21.470,1:21:26.740
the board for landing in the Rings and

1:21:23.300,1:21:29.240
she very nearly did basically took it

1:21:26.740,1:21:31.070
it's not gonna help her cause a great

1:21:29.240,1:21:33.170
deal forty seven point eight five now

1:21:31.070,1:21:35.240
I'm intrigued by the build-up to this

1:21:33.170,1:21:37.660
dive from Katie Bell just be quiet for a

1:21:35.240,1:21:37.660
second Bob

1:21:39.740,1:21:43.690
but you know chat to herself she

1:21:43.989,1:21:49.469
in with three and a half take it away

1:21:47.170,1:21:49.469
Casey

1:22:01.280,1:22:08.240
oh and it certainly worked this time 1 2

1:22:04.880,1:22:11.420
3 go is what you heard from a young miss

1:22:08.240,1:22:12.470
belt and then away she went and there's

1:22:11.420,1:22:15.920
Steve Foley national performance

1:22:12.470,1:22:19.340
director watching on from the audience

1:22:15.920,1:22:21.080
there and Bell this is the dive of her

1:22:19.340,1:22:25.670
meet look at that

1:22:21.080,1:22:27.500
wicked entry into the water super

1:22:25.670,1:22:30.550
slow-motion safe disses from the diving

1:22:27.500,1:22:34.520
board it's a big dive difficult to make

1:22:30.550,1:22:36.980
she disappears into the water good work

1:22:34.520,1:22:39.520
hurrah we've got a dive to save her last

1:22:36.980,1:22:42.380
and she has to after a couple of not

1:22:39.520,1:22:45.170
great rounds that's much much better

1:22:42.380,1:22:48.790
seventy eight point four zero and she's

1:22:45.170,1:22:52.670
given us ever chance up into 15th now I

1:22:48.790,1:22:54.740
am saying nothing about this diver apart

1:22:52.670,1:22:56.330
from what she's gonna do mister reversed

1:22:54.740,1:22:58.730
three and a half somersaults with tuck

1:22:56.330,1:23:03.220
three point three degree of difficulty

1:22:58.730,1:23:03.220
for the top-ranked Mexican

1:23:11.290,1:23:14.960
well she dies a lot better when you

1:23:13.429,1:23:16.610
don't say anything well that is she's

1:23:14.960,1:23:19.670
here only lady to choose to use this

1:23:16.610,1:23:21.050
dive it is incredibly difficult and well

1:23:19.670,1:23:22.520
the degree of difficulties three point

1:23:21.050,1:23:24.530
three and that's too low for this time

1:23:22.520,1:23:26.449
it used to be three point four and then

1:23:24.530,1:23:28.250
FINA messed around with the degrees of

1:23:26.449,1:23:30.110
difficulty and this dive suffered it's

1:23:28.250,1:23:31.820
much more difficult than the back three

1:23:30.110,1:23:33.949
and a half it is the reverse three and a

1:23:31.820,1:23:36.800
half normally seen only in the men's

1:23:33.949,1:23:39.560
competition parlor just showing her well

1:23:36.800,1:23:42.020
amazing dynamic diving style and that's

1:23:39.560,1:23:44.510
so best Ivan she needed it seventy two

1:23:42.020,1:23:47.560
point six zero she does it best when I

1:23:44.510,1:23:47.560
say nothing at all

1:23:48.159,1:23:57.560
now on to yulia coulton over of mexico's

1:23:54.440,1:24:01.429
rate of russia she's moved a bit for

1:23:57.560,1:24:03.469
three now some sort spike well it's

1:24:01.429,1:24:05.330
steady so you had a poor second round

1:24:03.469,1:24:07.489
dive didn't see this young lady so it

1:24:05.330,1:24:10.130
needed to be good quite a few girls with

1:24:07.489,1:24:12.469
a bit of work to do and this young lady

1:24:10.130,1:24:13.790
coming out on a third round with a

1:24:12.469,1:24:16.699
forward three and a half it's a good

1:24:13.790,1:24:19.790
pike shape all looks good to here just

1:24:16.699,1:24:21.920
maybe a touch short of vertical but

1:24:19.790,1:24:23.869
still if it gets over 70 points there

1:24:21.920,1:24:26.090
with the judges looking on with the

1:24:23.869,1:24:27.860
devices in the hands ready to input the

1:24:26.090,1:24:30.710
scores and they should be appearing on

1:24:27.860,1:24:32.949
your screen shortly for the russian

1:24:30.710,1:24:32.949
diver

1:24:44.360,1:24:50.300
now I go up of Japan let's go below it

1:24:47.840,1:24:53.480
was seventy three point five zero for

1:24:50.300,1:25:02.630
Colton over on to the back three and a

1:24:53.480,1:25:05.330
half for the Japanese with tuck or what

1:25:02.630,1:25:07.370
a big dive this is the hardest that

1:25:05.330,1:25:08.660
she's going to perform back three and a

1:25:07.370,1:25:11.090
half you seen lots of the girls

1:25:08.660,1:25:12.740
faltering on this one many of them

1:25:11.090,1:25:14.060
choosing the easier backward two and a

1:25:12.740,1:25:17.510
half in the pipe position

1:25:14.060,1:25:19.280
I think our really going out on this one

1:25:17.510,1:25:21.140
as to squeezing her hands are a bit high

1:25:19.280,1:25:24.880
in that touch choke close to the knees

1:25:21.140,1:25:27.260
she doesn't okay but she seems to bend

1:25:24.880,1:25:28.640
her knees as she goes in which kissing

1:25:27.260,1:25:31.070
pressure she was short but when she

1:25:28.640,1:25:32.960
wasn't so moving her feet too early look

1:25:31.070,1:25:35.870
she goes in just collapsing a little bit

1:25:32.960,1:25:38.930
on entry which is a shame yeah dozen

1:25:35.870,1:25:42.590
backup the 71 point four and the 72 for

1:25:38.930,1:25:44.840
Nakagawa 66 for the Japanese but okay

1:25:42.590,1:25:50.150
for her in terms of being back for the

1:25:44.840,1:25:52.460
semi quite safe territory in six at the

1:25:50.150,1:25:56.870
moment Kim of Korea finally in this

1:25:52.460,1:25:59.570
round you know I was watching this in

1:25:56.870,1:26:00.770
training and I was hoping it would it

1:25:59.570,1:26:02.060
would be better than training but that's

1:26:00.770,1:26:04.400
exactly what she's been doing in

1:26:02.060,1:26:05.840
training she's only 14 years old she's

1:26:04.400,1:26:07.490
in the Olympic Games and actually these

1:26:05.840,1:26:09.830
guys a little bit too difficult for her

1:26:07.490,1:26:12.650
she shouldn't really be doing these

1:26:09.830,1:26:14.510
times until she's more proficient at the

1:26:12.650,1:26:16.130
lower level look at that she's very

1:26:14.510,1:26:18.110
lucky not to really hurt yourselves

1:26:16.130,1:26:21.110
though that's only gonna get more twos

1:26:18.110,1:26:22.550
maybe she must have hurt us I'm sure but

1:26:21.110,1:26:24.200
she could have really hurt herself and

1:26:22.550,1:26:27.350
look she's she's fun to decide she's

1:26:24.200,1:26:29.000
okay yeah coach is saying you should

1:26:27.350,1:26:30.950
well I'm not sure what he's saying but

1:26:29.000,1:26:34.220
well app rider said he'd be hurt if her

1:26:30.950,1:26:36.620
body is not for those marks that come up

1:26:34.220,1:26:39.620
on the screen three two point five and

1:26:36.620,1:26:43.670
two will count towards her score twenty

1:26:39.620,1:26:46.420
four point seven five so the end of

1:26:43.670,1:26:49.010
round three women's 10-meter platform

1:26:46.420,1:26:50.570
Chinese one and two no real surprise

1:26:49.010,1:26:52.950
there the Australian three and four

1:26:50.570,1:26:55.050
likewise all those

1:26:52.950,1:26:59.520
that front page are feeling okay about

1:26:55.050,1:27:01.080
themselves as far as money cladding is

1:26:59.520,1:27:02.820
concerned she has a little bit of a

1:27:01.080,1:27:04.740
buffer there 19 points away from

1:27:02.820,1:27:06.870
problems but look at Paulo Espinoza

1:27:04.740,1:27:09.450
Sanchez bronze medal is from last year

1:27:06.870,1:27:10.200
in 18th place hanging on by a

1:27:09.450,1:27:12.390
fingernails

1:27:10.200,1:27:15.780
Stacy Powell has made up a bit of ground

1:27:12.390,1:27:18.080
she was 25th she's now 21st after round

1:27:15.780,1:27:18.080
three

1:27:31.420,1:27:37.040
around for about to start with the

1:27:34.370,1:27:38.900
woman's it's four rounds then five and

1:27:37.040,1:27:40.850
then with the men it's five rounds and

1:27:38.900,1:27:42.500
six so we also have an extra round for

1:27:40.850,1:27:45.230
the men before we get to the conclusion

1:27:42.500,1:27:47.990
of their program we'll see later on in

1:27:45.230,1:27:49.880
the week for the women it's five and the

1:27:47.990,1:27:52.100
degree of difficulty not quite as high

1:27:49.880,1:27:57.140
Stacy how are waiting for her turn and

1:27:52.100,1:27:58.340
for Great Britain and first up the best

1:27:57.140,1:28:01.940
position and we're gonna have a change

1:27:58.340,1:28:07.460
of judges after three rounds we change

1:28:01.940,1:28:12.230
the people with the devices to the video

1:28:07.460,1:28:13.890
came from Wiltshire house devices here

1:28:12.230,1:28:16.140
they are

1:28:13.890,1:28:17.640
favorite judges back hand a lot there's

1:28:16.140,1:28:20.450
just one less away from being a

1:28:17.640,1:28:20.450
Wimbledon champion

1:28:22.999,1:28:26.840
so just to remind you how the judges

1:28:24.860,1:28:29.449
work all seven judges input their scores

1:28:26.840,1:28:31.460
into the score pad and the device they

1:28:29.449,1:28:34.159
hold in their hands those seven schools

1:28:31.460,1:28:35.659
are calculated or actually put together

1:28:34.159,1:28:37.489
there are two high sand - Louis -

1:28:35.659,1:28:39.199
discounted they will be shown with the

1:28:37.489,1:28:40.670
lines through them the three that count

1:28:39.199,1:28:43.099
and multiplied by the degree of

1:28:40.670,1:28:46.999
difficulty which gives the total for

1:28:43.099,1:28:50.510
that particular dive first diver in

1:28:46.999,1:28:54.530
round four of the woman's 10 metre

1:28:50.510,1:28:57.559
platform preliminary is from the USA it

1:28:54.530,1:28:59.809
is Brittany violet and she will perform

1:28:57.559,1:29:01.999
at slightly lower tariff time and

1:28:59.809,1:29:04.579
slightly lower that 2.9 degree of

1:29:01.999,1:29:09.610
difficulty on this back two and a half

1:29:04.579,1:29:09.610
somersaults formed in the pike position

1:29:12.760,1:29:19.039
it's a good dive from Brittany opening

1:29:17.269,1:29:21.199
up three good ones already in the bag

1:29:19.039,1:29:23.150
and then this one just a little over she

1:29:21.199,1:29:24.440
goes into the water backwards spinning

1:29:23.150,1:29:26.179
so you can only see where you've been

1:29:24.440,1:29:28.849
not where you're going so as to judge

1:29:26.179,1:29:31.280
where to point your feet up just miss

1:29:28.849,1:29:34.639
timing it they're slightly reason over

1:29:31.280,1:29:38.570
she goes she'll get sixes she wanted

1:29:34.639,1:29:40.820
more than that yeah save it she goes in

1:29:38.570,1:29:44.479
no programs rather tailed off as near

1:29:40.820,1:29:48.710
was so good scores of 1773 now 57

1:29:44.479,1:29:52.789
followed by 53 she's starting to just

1:29:48.710,1:29:55.070
hurtle down the top 18 standings but she

1:29:52.789,1:29:57.440
was eight after round three so should be

1:29:55.070,1:29:58.510
okay finding the fianc award happens

1:29:57.440,1:30:02.809
later on

1:29:58.510,1:30:05.119
audrey LeBeau france for three and a

1:30:02.809,1:30:07.849
half summer sorts with pike just getting

1:30:05.119,1:30:15.289
into the realms of the threes now 3.0

1:30:07.849,1:30:17.719
exactly on her dive number four Wow some

1:30:15.289,1:30:19.070
faults starting to come in now it's very

1:30:17.719,1:30:22.280
difficult to hold your concentration on

1:30:19.070,1:30:25.039
such a long competition remember each

1:30:22.280,1:30:27.170
dive takes around 1.6 seconds and then

1:30:25.039,1:30:29.239
you go and sit down for 20 minutes or so

1:30:27.170,1:30:31.400
in between dives and then need to get

1:30:29.239,1:30:34.460
yourself back in the game and Audrey

1:30:31.400,1:30:36.380
their faltering over a vertical lots of

1:30:34.460,1:30:38.120
splash being thrown up

1:30:36.380,1:30:40.400
Wow they'll put it off the pace this

1:30:38.120,1:30:41.540
pack is really being shuffled right

1:30:40.400,1:30:43.040
before our eyes

1:30:41.540,1:30:46.970
that's why I said we were ready to write

1:30:43.040,1:30:48.430
anybody off at this stage because into a

1:30:46.970,1:30:51.260
good position and then immediately

1:30:48.430,1:30:54.620
undoes all the good work forty point

1:30:51.260,1:30:57.260
five zero or dueler boat it's not gonna

1:30:54.620,1:31:00.260
help sixteenth after round three

1:30:57.260,1:31:08.480
probably outside the top eighteen after

1:31:00.260,1:31:12.110
this now understand time for Megan Ben

1:31:08.480,1:31:14.660
feet OH three point three degree of

1:31:12.110,1:31:22.190
difficulty attached to this one it's an

1:31:14.660,1:31:25.580
arm stand back with tuck well everyone's

1:31:22.190,1:31:27.800
having to go maybe I'm not sure what's

1:31:25.580,1:31:30.560
happening out there you can tell like

1:31:27.800,1:31:32.780
the swim to the side she does not want

1:31:30.560,1:31:35.720
to come up and hear the scores or looks

1:31:32.780,1:31:37.940
okay so far and then just thinking she's

1:31:35.720,1:31:39.820
rotating slower than she is so pointing

1:31:37.940,1:31:43.730
your toes up a little bit too high

1:31:39.820,1:31:46.160
misjudging ending over a vertical mixed

1:31:43.730,1:31:47.750
bag to Seamus three point three and that

1:31:46.160,1:31:49.970
isn't going to count really the degree

1:31:47.750,1:31:52.580
of difficulty you need more raw scores

1:31:49.970,1:31:54.980
more execution marks for the judges 5.5

1:31:52.580,1:31:57.230
isn't going to cut it any obvious reason

1:31:54.980,1:31:59.690
why the standard tonight isn't really

1:31:57.230,1:32:02.240
not kind of good off base level has it

1:31:59.690,1:32:04.010
at any stage a bit unfair to some of the

1:32:02.240,1:32:05.480
divers who have had a little bit of

1:32:04.010,1:32:07.160
brilliance and as we move on to the

1:32:05.480,1:32:10.250
Olympic champion let's see if she can

1:32:07.160,1:32:12.890
buck the trend general in back three and

1:32:10.250,1:32:16.820
a half somersaults see how it should be

1:32:12.890,1:32:18.500
done from the Chinese well it was good

1:32:16.820,1:32:21.230
it was better than what we have been

1:32:18.500,1:32:23.000
seeing but it's not at the standard of

1:32:21.230,1:32:25.250
the Olympic champion that we would be

1:32:23.000,1:32:26.870
accustomed to it's a big dive those

1:32:25.250,1:32:28.400
three point three let's not take away on

1:32:26.870,1:32:31.280
how difficult it is and up until this

1:32:28.400,1:32:33.380
point is perfect just a little bit over

1:32:31.280,1:32:35.840
she goes into the water it's gonna get

1:32:33.380,1:32:38.030
over 70 points and in women's platform

1:32:35.840,1:32:40.340
diamond over 70 points is very good and

1:32:38.030,1:32:42.800
sometimes we see them get over 80 as

1:32:40.340,1:32:44.570
well well she did in the previous round

1:32:42.800,1:32:45.350
eighty one point six zero but this time

1:32:44.570,1:32:50.170
round and there

1:32:45.350,1:32:54.260
we're near as good ayuh tariff 270 4.25

1:32:50.170,1:32:57.340
no doubting that she will be in the top

1:32:54.260,1:33:01.990
18 come the end of this competition

1:32:57.340,1:33:07.880
equal fourth going into round 4 Julia

1:33:01.990,1:33:09.920
got Chuck again yes the arm stand three

1:33:07.880,1:33:11.000
points okay let me explain what she's

1:33:09.920,1:33:12.590
done there this is why we have the

1:33:11.000,1:33:15.290
official at the back of the diving board

1:33:12.590,1:33:18.260
to see if this happens so this is

1:33:15.290,1:33:20.180
actually a restart so she's gone to lift

1:33:18.260,1:33:22.520
up into the handstand she is over

1:33:20.180,1:33:24.020
balance and she's come down now what

1:33:22.520,1:33:26.780
will happen is she will perform the dive

1:33:24.020,1:33:28.160
that the judges will mark out of ten as

1:33:26.780,1:33:30.740
normal but then there will be a

1:33:28.160,1:33:33.290
two-point deduction from each judge for

1:33:30.740,1:33:35.030
the restart so I'll explain that when

1:33:33.290,1:33:38.570
the marks come up so she has to compose

1:33:35.030,1:33:46.520
herself forget that she's just made a

1:33:38.570,1:33:47.990
glaring error or what a shame all she

1:33:46.520,1:33:49.820
needed to do was lift her chin as she

1:33:47.990,1:33:53.120
went back into the water and that would

1:33:49.820,1:33:54.800
have been spot-on well nothing you could

1:33:53.120,1:33:56.360
do about the restarts of the judges as I

1:33:54.800,1:33:57.830
explained will mark kind of 10 there

1:33:56.360,1:34:00.740
will be a two-point deduction from each

1:33:57.830,1:34:02.330
of the judges and then it will be

1:34:00.740,1:34:05.660
multiplied by the degree of difficulty

1:34:02.330,1:34:07.640
to give the total so it's a shame the

1:34:05.660,1:34:09.440
dive wasn't a little bit better for she

1:34:07.640,1:34:10.880
did all the hard work and then she

1:34:09.440,1:34:13.070
needed to look back a little bit more

1:34:10.880,1:34:15.650
with her chin to get up light as she

1:34:13.070,1:34:18.260
went into the water let's have a look so

1:34:15.650,1:34:20.300
she would have gone 7 reads 5 7 and 1/2

1:34:18.260,1:34:22.040
reads five and a half and seven 1/2

1:34:20.300,1:34:23.170
reads five and a half to give the total

1:34:22.040,1:34:26.560
of 52

1:34:23.170,1:34:26.560
[Music]

1:34:27.880,1:34:32.450
there's no point the coach telling her

1:34:29.990,1:34:36.320
she knows exactly what she had to do

1:34:32.450,1:34:38.480
when she didn't do crowd really getting

1:34:36.320,1:34:41.870
behind Stacy Powell who's done a little

1:34:38.480,1:34:45.170
reparation job in round three still

1:34:41.870,1:34:46.970
little bit more what to do she can see

1:34:45.170,1:34:48.980
everybody else faltering she has a

1:34:46.970,1:34:53.150
chance to take advantage of that with a

1:34:48.980,1:34:56.390
3.2 inward three-and-a-half somersaults

1:34:53.150,1:34:59.620
with tuck very talented young diver when

1:34:56.390,1:34:59.620
she came through at Crystal Palace

1:34:59.789,1:35:04.920
we've done in leaps and bounds and I

1:35:01.929,1:35:09.119
can't she do it literally with this

1:35:04.920,1:35:09.119
fourth round I of Stacy pal

1:35:12.060,1:35:19.350
oh she needed to be better than that

1:35:16.500,1:35:21.150
very poor second mind I've just off a

1:35:19.350,1:35:24.000
game here real shame I was standing up

1:35:21.150,1:35:26.520
and clapping this dive in training which

1:35:24.000,1:35:28.020
was you know just ten minutes before the

1:35:26.520,1:35:29.610
start of this competition here

1:35:28.020,1:35:31.440
staying in the Tuck shape to long chin

1:35:29.610,1:35:34.170
in on the chest look at all that splash

1:35:31.440,1:35:36.090
being thrown up well there's been lots

1:35:34.170,1:35:39.300
of divers who are making mistakes and

1:35:36.090,1:35:40.950
Stacey is one of them one more dive to

1:35:39.300,1:35:44.460
go and that would need to be nailed in

1:35:40.950,1:35:46.590
order to for her to get through 48 I'm

1:35:44.460,1:35:50.820
afraid that's a sorry tale for Stacey

1:35:46.590,1:35:54.210
fives and the up to 48 so she's a 29 and

1:35:50.820,1:35:55.590
a 48 that could ultimately be the

1:35:54.210,1:35:59.700
difference between her getting through

1:35:55.590,1:36:03.180
to the semi-final and not bad key of

1:35:59.700,1:36:05.540
Italy inward three and a half in the

1:36:03.180,1:36:05.540
tuck position

1:36:11.530,1:36:17.300
well this is nemi's most difficult dive

1:36:14.090,1:36:19.610
and she has certainly turned it on when

1:36:17.300,1:36:22.280
it came to lots of her competitors

1:36:19.610,1:36:24.380
falter around her nose if she wants to

1:36:22.280,1:36:26.270
make it through this most difficult dive

1:36:24.380,1:36:28.070
of hers needed to be good and that will

1:36:26.270,1:36:37.250
get seven and a half's and eight maybe

1:36:28.070,1:36:43.240
and a big score judges just inputting

1:36:37.250,1:36:46.190
their scores into their machines and

1:36:43.240,1:36:49.400
this is what they say seven point five

1:36:46.190,1:36:51.680
and eight four near me back heat and

1:36:49.400,1:36:54.130
seventy five point two and she's been

1:36:51.680,1:36:57.290
most consistent divers here tonight

1:36:54.130,1:37:02.420
hasn't been below 65 in any of the

1:36:57.290,1:37:05.360
rounds Ian Stewart of Germany 12th after

1:37:02.420,1:37:08.300
round three it's back two and half

1:37:05.360,1:37:10.670
someone's again but degree of difficulty

1:37:08.300,1:37:14.480
down below the threes into two point

1:37:10.670,1:37:18.020
nine it's normally one of our better

1:37:14.480,1:37:19.940
dives and it proves the same today very

1:37:18.020,1:37:22.220
consistent on this backwards spinning

1:37:19.940,1:37:25.340
move seems to know exactly where she is

1:37:22.220,1:37:28.310
spotting the water twice as she spins

1:37:25.340,1:37:29.660
around showing the strain on the takeoff

1:37:28.310,1:37:34.010
there they still get eight and a half

1:37:29.660,1:37:36.110
for sure it's a beautiful dive reaches

1:37:34.010,1:37:40.040
back in looking for that rip entry and

1:37:36.110,1:37:42.440
there it is underlining why sometimes

1:37:40.040,1:37:44.870
the lower tariff dives have a safety

1:37:42.440,1:37:46.580
first option and she just proved it with

1:37:44.870,1:37:48.050
a two point nine when the three point

1:37:46.580,1:37:51.110
three haven't been working for others

1:37:48.050,1:37:54.380
she pigs have a nice decent solid score

1:37:51.110,1:37:57.560
and she can jock her weight into the top

1:37:54.380,1:38:01.880
18 fairly soon with times like that

1:37:57.560,1:38:04.700
seventy-three point nine five mana

1:38:01.880,1:38:07.610
cladding being a good reaction a good

1:38:04.700,1:38:11.780
support a good reception from the home

1:38:07.610,1:38:14.060
crowd she performs we've come on Monique

1:38:11.780,1:38:16.070
from Mercer me in the crowd she's trying

1:38:14.060,1:38:20.590
to compose herself they get an idea just

1:38:16.070,1:38:20.590
what she has to do know she has to go

1:38:20.730,1:38:26.199
fantastic shot that's it back two and a

1:38:23.860,1:38:29.380
half sour sorts with Mike two point nine

1:38:26.199,1:38:33.610
Monique it's been the breathing right

1:38:29.380,1:38:36.870
getting the posture right 14th after

1:38:33.610,1:38:36.870
round three

1:38:37.260,1:38:42.280
well she's let it go as well he's a real

1:38:40.300,1:38:43.900
shame the take off look good she has

1:38:42.280,1:38:46.420
been struggling with the neck injury

1:38:43.900,1:38:48.430
maybe that was she was protecting it a

1:38:46.420,1:38:51.160
little bit she didn't look back and she

1:38:48.430,1:38:54.100
came out seemed to stay in a slight dish

1:38:51.160,1:38:56.770
position letting the dive go over all

1:38:54.100,1:39:00.330
just overcooked it over she goes and

1:38:56.770,1:39:04.030
that's a poor dive for Monique as well

1:39:00.330,1:39:06.790
has she done enough one more dive to go

1:39:04.030,1:39:07.390
and all to play for to make this top 18

1:39:06.790,1:39:10.480
Cup

1:39:07.390,1:39:11.949
well first three round eyes were okay so

1:39:10.480,1:39:13.600
she's got a little bit of margin of

1:39:11.949,1:39:16.540
error thirty nine point one five will

1:39:13.600,1:39:20.530
pull her back a little bit and she was

1:39:16.540,1:39:25.449
14th out around three so it's tight for

1:39:20.530,1:39:28.670
qualification you need an of China third

1:39:25.449,1:39:30.920
after round three

1:39:28.670,1:39:32.510
well everyone's having a go at making

1:39:30.920,1:39:33.850
mistakes this evening just showing you

1:39:32.510,1:39:36.500
how difficult it is to perform

1:39:33.850,1:39:37.160
consistently in this level of

1:39:36.500,1:39:39.710
competition

1:39:37.160,1:39:41.900
lots of divers and lots of waiting in

1:39:39.710,1:39:44.830
between dives and some lapses in

1:39:41.900,1:39:47.570
concentration even fom who you Dan

1:39:44.830,1:39:51.010
well sure she goes in throwing up the

1:39:47.570,1:39:53.420
splash maybe I know four and a half five

1:39:51.010,1:39:55.930
and you're gonna get about 50 points

1:39:53.420,1:39:59.000
I'm really really puzzled by this

1:39:55.930,1:40:02.480
Espinoza having an off night new you Dan

1:39:59.000,1:40:04.130
having really an off night wants to grab

1:40:02.480,1:40:05.570
this competition I know that the marks

1:40:04.130,1:40:07.400
won't be carried forward but you've got

1:40:05.570,1:40:10.340
to get in that top 18 she should have a

1:40:07.400,1:40:13.550
bit of a safety buffer anyway but it's

1:40:10.340,1:40:15.710
amazing the best divers in the world not

1:40:13.550,1:40:20.450
coming to terms with this competition so

1:40:15.710,1:40:23.630
far a few notable exceptions came on

1:40:20.450,1:40:25.880
yang with her back three and a half

1:40:23.630,1:40:29.630
somersaults with tuck big degree of

1:40:25.880,1:40:31.580
difficulty for her 3.3 right and she

1:40:29.630,1:40:34.600
will go leaping up the standings and

1:40:31.580,1:40:34.600
into the top 18

1:40:37.310,1:40:40.460
your get it.white she does well there we

1:40:40.040,1:40:43.340
go

1:40:40.460,1:40:46.490
bucking the trend once again one or two

1:40:43.340,1:40:48.110
divers refusing to fall in rapport with

1:40:46.490,1:40:50.830
all the others who seem to be faltering

1:40:48.110,1:40:53.390
left right and center Kim here

1:40:50.830,1:40:55.400
absolutely nailing her back three and a

1:40:53.390,1:40:57.140
half that's really good that should get

1:40:55.400,1:40:59.150
close to 80 points and that's going to

1:40:57.140,1:41:04.010
be one of the highest going dives of the

1:40:59.150,1:41:06.440
competition so far well I can be done

1:41:04.010,1:41:08.570
and she has just done it seventy nine

1:41:06.440,1:41:10.370
point two zero is on my screen with

1:41:08.570,1:41:13.520
confirmation on yours there it is

1:41:10.370,1:41:16.280
eight times the degree of difficulty and

1:41:13.520,1:41:19.730
240 point nine zero and she's within

1:41:16.280,1:41:24.260
touching distance of returning tomorrow

1:41:19.730,1:41:26.270
morning there's any broken back three

1:41:24.260,1:41:30.040
and a half for her three point three in

1:41:26.270,1:41:30.040
the tough position

1:41:33.110,1:41:39.470
oh it's a most difficult dive and a lot

1:41:36.230,1:41:41.570
of girls faltering on this one Brittany

1:41:39.470,1:41:42.710
they're the young 16 year old holding it

1:41:41.570,1:41:44.660
together it's not the best she's ever

1:41:42.710,1:41:46.760
done it I've watched her in training but

1:41:44.660,1:41:47.930
she's got such power look at that double

1:41:46.760,1:41:50.000
almost by board-level

1:41:47.930,1:41:52.760
knows where she is just moving her feet

1:41:50.000,1:41:55.400
a little bit too high but yeah that's

1:41:52.760,1:41:57.110
going to get high 60s which is good

1:41:55.400,1:41:59.810
enough especially in this level of

1:41:57.110,1:42:00.920
contests you can afford not to dive at

1:41:59.810,1:42:02.600
your best and still make it through

1:42:00.920,1:42:04.310
effortlessly you know I think the judges

1:42:02.600,1:42:05.780
are actually quite happy to see a dive

1:42:04.310,1:42:07.760
they can give some marks if so maybe

1:42:05.780,1:42:10.040
they get a little bit more than they

1:42:07.760,1:42:13.040
deserve but seventeen point nine five is

1:42:10.040,1:42:16.130
okay that's very good I understand as of

1:42:13.040,1:42:19.370
tonight and she will go into second

1:42:16.130,1:42:25.300
place for the time being and up there

1:42:19.370,1:42:28.130
with the best brenda spazzy ani of italy

1:42:25.300,1:42:31.160
arm stand back double somersault one

1:42:28.130,1:42:33.290
half twist three point two degree of

1:42:31.160,1:42:37.670
difficulty move all you've seen now this

1:42:33.290,1:42:39.860
can go wrong the effort you have to be

1:42:37.670,1:42:42.850
put through and go through it's going to

1:42:39.860,1:42:42.850
be precise

1:42:47.080,1:42:52.160
well Brenda seemed okay all the way

1:42:50.540,1:42:53.960
through that dive and then just couldn't

1:42:52.160,1:42:56.780
seem to hold the splash down as she went

1:42:53.960,1:42:58.790
in the dives a little bit maybe

1:42:56.780,1:43:00.980
aggressive on the start a little bit too

1:42:58.790,1:43:03.290
much rotation means the over rotation

1:43:00.980,1:43:05.980
and the entry here you go can't quite

1:43:03.290,1:43:09.500
stop it and then the splash rolls over

1:43:05.980,1:43:13.030
another mediocre dive very ordinary dies

1:43:09.500,1:43:13.030
here this evening for a lot of the women

1:43:14.470,1:43:22.000
what do the judges rate or reckon to

1:43:17.720,1:43:24.080
that really very highly at all 5.5 and a

1:43:22.000,1:43:27.620
5-4 right at the end but I won't count

1:43:24.080,1:43:32.840
and that's a mark and Sebastiani won't

1:43:27.620,1:43:38.330
be overly encouraged by 51 point 2 0 for

1:43:32.840,1:43:46.460
the Italian now on to Karolina Hernandez

1:43:38.330,1:43:50.780
of Mexico joint 19th the last round in a

1:43:46.460,1:43:52.940
long preparation for she lifts off with

1:43:50.780,1:43:56.510
an inward three and a half somersaults

1:43:52.940,1:44:04.370
with tuck and three point two is the

1:43:56.510,1:44:07.790
degree of difficulty on this one she's

1:44:04.370,1:44:09.020
having to dig deep to get herself back

1:44:07.790,1:44:12.470
in contention and that was certainly

1:44:09.020,1:44:14.210
help 3.2 degree of difficulty real shame

1:44:12.470,1:44:16.910
on her previous dive she made a real

1:44:14.210,1:44:18.290
mess of it this one fortunately she's

1:44:16.910,1:44:20.260
back in the kind of form she's been

1:44:18.290,1:44:24.040
showing in training only 15 years old

1:44:20.260,1:44:27.290
Mexico riding high from recent successes

1:44:24.040,1:44:28.730
and then and as here trying to get back

1:44:27.290,1:44:32.120
in contention and I think that might

1:44:28.730,1:44:33.740
help that's not gonna hinder her after

1:44:32.120,1:44:36.320
some of them are too seen yeah I think

1:44:33.740,1:44:38.870
in the 7.5 range is pretty good by

1:44:36.320,1:44:41.330
tonight standard 72 for here that's why

1:44:38.870,1:44:44.270
the smile is back on the face she

1:44:41.330,1:44:48.610
contemplates hopefully being back in the

1:44:44.270,1:44:52.490
top 18 for the semi-final filly on

1:44:48.610,1:44:55.520
I'm stand back triple somersault way too

1:44:52.490,1:44:57.850
close to the exclusion zone at the

1:44:55.520,1:44:57.850
moment

1:44:57.890,1:45:03.360
three point three degree of difficulty

1:45:01.830,1:45:11.100
slightly more difficult to understand

1:45:03.360,1:45:14.400
than the previous one or she's nailed it

1:45:11.100,1:45:16.410
and she needed to again faltering on the

1:45:14.400,1:45:18.150
second and third round dives here so

1:45:16.410,1:45:19.890
fourth way and dive the highest equal

1:45:18.150,1:45:22.890
highest degree of difficulty three point

1:45:19.890,1:45:24.600
three so tricky balancing hands she's

1:45:22.890,1:45:26.310
quite high on a tux check he does manage

1:45:24.600,1:45:28.050
to dig your fingernails into the top of

1:45:26.310,1:45:30.470
her knees there and hang on in there for

1:45:28.050,1:45:32.610
the ride and she makes it

1:45:30.470,1:45:39.240
mid-seventies and that'll certainly move

1:45:32.610,1:45:41.730
up the field yeah she'll be much happier

1:45:39.240,1:45:42.870
with that after a couple of days I

1:45:41.730,1:45:46.050
haven't quite got her way that one

1:45:42.870,1:45:48.720
definitely does and the mark of seventy

1:45:46.050,1:45:52.410
five point nine zero and up the

1:45:48.720,1:45:54.690
standings and she can start to think one

1:45:52.410,1:45:57.960
more dive hopefully I will be safe for

1:45:54.690,1:45:59.610
tomorrow but nobody in the ten downward

1:45:57.960,1:46:00.030
stage can really be thinking that right

1:45:59.610,1:46:03.120
now

1:46:00.030,1:46:07.230
Melissa whoo in with three and a half

1:46:03.120,1:46:09.630
somersaults for the Australian well over

1:46:07.230,1:46:11.790
she goes hard work done

1:46:09.630,1:46:15.150
aerial work is good and then just the

1:46:11.790,1:46:16.980
exit from the dive she isn't predicting

1:46:15.150,1:46:19.410
it correctly either see in the water at

1:46:16.980,1:46:21.300
the right time is a real shame because

1:46:19.410,1:46:23.850
it all looks good so far and then she

1:46:21.300,1:46:25.950
just miss times at entry and over she

1:46:23.850,1:46:29.010
goes splash throws back towards the

1:46:25.950,1:46:32.670
diving board and even Melissa whoo

1:46:29.010,1:46:37.200
having a wobble out there fifty-four

1:46:32.670,1:46:40.910
point four zero and the top marks are

1:46:37.200,1:46:40.910
eluding many of the top divers

1:46:41.090,1:46:46.679
that's how it stands at the moment chin

1:46:44.010,1:46:52.909
roben and backe we're still quite a few

1:46:46.679,1:46:58.710
names to go next up will be Maria Cuyo

1:46:52.909,1:46:59.969
Germany from Berlin and it's a back two

1:46:58.710,1:47:04.349
and a half somersaults one and a half

1:46:59.969,1:47:06.329
twist for her yeah it's okay

1:47:04.349,1:47:10.760
she yeah her seemed to get it all

1:47:06.329,1:47:13.199
working in the right way in the end some

1:47:10.760,1:47:14.820
interesting movements before she took

1:47:13.199,1:47:17.610
off but got there in the end here we are

1:47:14.820,1:47:19.800
one and a half twist a little bit low on

1:47:17.610,1:47:21.780
the water here but she plays the waiting

1:47:19.800,1:47:23.969
game looks at the water punches a hole

1:47:21.780,1:47:28.099
with her hands and gets in relatively

1:47:23.969,1:47:31.380
clean not so much splash pretty average

1:47:28.099,1:47:33.179
mediocre ordinary six is 6.5 s don't

1:47:31.380,1:47:35.010
really know I've got a word that I can

1:47:33.179,1:47:36.840
use for that but there we go it's hard

1:47:35.010,1:47:39.420
to know what is mediocre today those

1:47:36.840,1:47:40.889
noon sixty two point four zero for the

1:47:39.420,1:47:43.710
gem and that might just be good enough

1:47:40.889,1:47:49.320
to slider up the standings and get her

1:47:43.710,1:47:54.119
on the cusp of making the stop a team to

1:47:49.320,1:47:56.480
the Malaysian and a tank top position

1:47:54.119,1:48:01.560
for the inward three-and-a-half tenth

1:47:56.480,1:48:03.119
after around she's on fire today one of

1:48:01.560,1:48:04.980
the few that are actually performing

1:48:03.119,1:48:07.889
look it up punch in the air from the

1:48:04.980,1:48:08.639
Malaysian coach he likes it and I

1:48:07.889,1:48:10.619
certainly do

1:48:08.639,1:48:13.489
thank you it's nice to see some well

1:48:10.619,1:48:18.540
executed dives and this from panda Lella

1:48:13.489,1:48:20.550
superb will it get over 80 points and

1:48:18.540,1:48:22.619
wake up the competition a little bit and

1:48:20.550,1:48:25.170
keep me keep me on the edge of my seat

1:48:22.619,1:48:27.179
it needs it in these shaky that grabbing

1:48:25.170,1:48:29.280
the hands punching a hole in the water

1:48:27.179,1:48:31.710
taking all this all the air down with

1:48:29.280,1:48:34.530
her causing a suction suction excuse me

1:48:31.710,1:48:38.369
for that entry I think it's about the

1:48:34.530,1:48:40.530
fourth eighty of the night so I would

1:48:38.369,1:48:44.780
for 4/5 I've been to many more than that

1:48:40.530,1:48:48.710
eighty one point six zero four and Anna

1:48:44.780,1:48:48.710
yeah we've been sleeping too

1:48:49.580,1:48:58.710
here's Kim Jin och I'm Stan for her

1:48:55.700,1:49:00.510
you're kissing the board yeah using an

1:48:58.710,1:49:04.020
incredible amount of arm strength

1:49:00.510,1:49:06.870
they're very gymnastic on her wanna

1:49:04.020,1:49:09.210
approach and the technical take off here

1:49:06.870,1:49:11.430
we go look at this looks like a vault oh

1:49:09.210,1:49:13.290
she did she actually put her nose on the

1:49:11.430,1:49:15.120
platform Wow

1:49:13.290,1:49:16.860
that can't be very comfortable I would

1:49:15.120,1:49:19.980
like to bang my nose on the platform

1:49:16.860,1:49:22.320
before then flick off with the legs who

1:49:19.980,1:49:24.060
actually pops up one twisting in very

1:49:22.320,1:49:25.740
peculiar and uncomfortable I would

1:49:24.060,1:49:27.930
suggest but there we go the divers

1:49:25.740,1:49:30.390
alright no bruise on the nose that I can

1:49:27.930,1:49:31.500
see and 65 points to take away with her

1:49:30.390,1:49:33.240
well obviously any occasion would

1:49:31.500,1:49:41.340
improve it but sixty five point one zero

1:49:33.240,1:49:45.510
for Kim and she's up to 12 now Annie

1:49:41.340,1:49:47.370
Rivera of Cuba her turn to do the three

1:49:45.510,1:49:50.520
point two version there's a three point

1:49:47.370,1:49:52.650
three version 3.2 version of the arm

1:49:50.520,1:50:00.120
stand back a double somersault one and a

1:49:52.650,1:50:01.950
half twists that's one of her better

1:50:00.120,1:50:06.480
dives today have really struggling out

1:50:01.950,1:50:09.660
there today the young Cuban and it's

1:50:06.480,1:50:11.400
nice to see her landed the water without

1:50:09.660,1:50:13.020
hurting herself the previous dive would

1:50:11.400,1:50:16.020
of course just some discomfort that one

1:50:13.020,1:50:18.180
on her head that yeah she'll be one of

1:50:16.020,1:50:21.030
the few I think there's the eight that

1:50:18.180,1:50:27.270
won't be going through into the top 18

1:50:21.030,1:50:29.070
and she'll be one of them fives and one

1:50:27.270,1:50:34.980
six

1:50:29.070,1:50:38.429
a total mark 50 4.40 Tracy took yet of

1:50:34.980,1:50:40.349
Malaysia and it looks like she's on her

1:50:38.429,1:50:44.610
way through hopefully at the moment

1:50:40.349,1:50:46.290
Tracy is not 2.7 were right down the

1:50:44.610,1:50:50.820
bottom of the scale here reverse two and

1:50:46.290,1:50:52.650
a half it's well executed and his bobble

1:50:50.820,1:50:54.540
suggesting she is off the pace at the

1:50:52.650,1:50:58.079
moment only 24th after the previous

1:50:54.540,1:51:00.090
round probably needed to be a little bit

1:50:58.079,1:51:02.489
better on this although it is one of her

1:51:00.090,1:51:04.260
bed of efforts reverse two and a half

1:51:02.489,1:51:06.090
standing for was jumping away from the

1:51:04.260,1:51:09.420
diving board spinning backwards towards

1:51:06.090,1:51:11.670
it'll get sevens 7.5 maybe there's low

1:51:09.420,1:51:15.840
DD so probably won't get too too close

1:51:11.670,1:51:17.940
to at well close to 60 pretty much on

1:51:15.840,1:51:19.469
the button there Leon 60 point seven

1:51:17.940,1:51:23.099
five for Tracy

1:51:19.469,1:51:34.230
7.5 and that's better they're not quite

1:51:23.099,1:51:36.570
good enough just the swimsuit talk to

1:51:34.230,1:51:38.590
yourself have a chat

1:51:36.570,1:51:41.410
Thank You Stefan

1:51:38.590,1:51:43.960
back three and a half somersaults for

1:51:41.410,1:51:47.070
Katie Bell that's 24 year old Walker

1:51:43.960,1:51:47.070
County we're gonna get this time

1:51:58.940,1:52:05.270
oh it's a good dive two five six seven

1:52:02.450,1:52:08.930
eight counting certainly work for this

1:52:05.270,1:52:11.450
time it seems to be very fidgety but on

1:52:08.930,1:52:12.770
a nervous-looking character on the end

1:52:11.450,1:52:14.120
of the diving board but if any of you

1:52:12.770,1:52:15.800
sitting at home we're up on the 10 meter

1:52:14.120,1:52:18.260
I'm sure your heart would be beating a

1:52:15.800,1:52:20.210
little bit quicker than normal normally

1:52:18.260,1:52:22.630
and Katie Bell they're nailing a fourth

1:52:20.210,1:52:24.950
round dive backing up in the third round

1:52:22.630,1:52:26.030
dive of home at three and a half with a

1:52:24.950,1:52:27.680
back three and a half this is the

1:52:26.030,1:52:30.230
highest degree of difficulty and she's

1:52:27.680,1:52:32.150
made it came Michele Shooto up the

1:52:30.230,1:52:34.000
leaderboards yeah five six seven eight

1:52:32.150,1:52:40.940
taking steps to put things right

1:52:34.000,1:52:43.280
seventy nine point two zero on to the

1:52:40.940,1:52:44.990
bronze medalist from last year at the

1:52:43.280,1:52:47.150
World Championships we haven't seen that

1:52:44.990,1:52:51.290
kind of form so far and she is flirting

1:52:47.150,1:52:54.620
with going out 18th place I'll go see

1:52:51.290,1:52:56.300
the real howler Espinoza Sanchez on this

1:52:54.620,1:52:59.710
dive in with three and a half

1:52:56.300,1:52:59.710
somersaults three point two

1:53:04.720,1:53:11.120
well that's much more like it that is a

1:53:07.730,1:53:15.890
nod towards the real polar Espinoza

1:53:11.120,1:53:18.290
Sanchez silver medalist their partner

1:53:15.890,1:53:19.640
witness synchronized platform diving a

1:53:18.290,1:53:21.080
lot better in the synchronized platform

1:53:19.640,1:53:22.840
of course this is more like it little

1:53:21.080,1:53:25.610
over at vertical but that will get eight

1:53:22.840,1:53:27.910
mid-70s again to go with the 72 from the

1:53:25.610,1:53:31.070
third round I think she's back

1:53:27.910,1:53:35.450
approaching the top end of the field or

1:53:31.070,1:53:37.040
certainly they're the top ten well it's

1:53:35.450,1:53:40.190
a nifty they're up a few places for the

1:53:37.040,1:53:41.990
time being up to 13th from 18th and that

1:53:40.190,1:53:43.400
will be secure of course you can start

1:53:41.990,1:53:46.700
all over again in the semis

1:53:43.400,1:53:50.930
if she does make it Julia

1:53:46.700,1:53:54.260
Carlton over 9th at the moment two more

1:53:50.930,1:53:57.830
dives for her to come and it's the

1:53:54.260,1:54:01.040
inward three-and-a-half somersaults tuck

1:53:57.830,1:54:05.450
position 3.2 is the degree of difficulty

1:54:01.040,1:54:07.670
she's just over the 200 mark it's a

1:54:05.450,1:54:09.920
little low on the water but managed to

1:54:07.670,1:54:12.320
get out and make just in time to get the

1:54:09.920,1:54:14.930
impression that she was vertical as she

1:54:12.320,1:54:20.120
went in the judges will take marks off

1:54:14.930,1:54:21.950
her being a low finish diving board yeah

1:54:20.120,1:54:24.320
it's a little bit over with an arch as

1:54:21.950,1:54:26.330
well I don't know I don't know what I

1:54:24.320,1:54:28.610
get that actually a little bit close a

1:54:26.330,1:54:30.290
little bit low six and a half maybe I

1:54:28.610,1:54:30.590
don't know I didn't really like it that

1:54:30.290,1:54:33.170
much

1:54:30.590,1:54:35.030
oh just being about generous perhaps 7.5

1:54:33.170,1:54:36.830
s will count as well the 7 on your

1:54:35.030,1:54:39.260
screen lines through the scores mean

1:54:36.830,1:54:41.870
they do not count multiplied by the

1:54:39.260,1:54:47.810
degree of difficulty 70 point 4 0 is how

1:54:41.870,1:54:51.470
you arrived at that mark my Nakagawa of

1:54:47.810,1:54:53.120
Japan 2.9 but she's already done some

1:54:51.470,1:54:57.469
good work to get herself in sixth place

1:54:53.120,1:55:01.219
with two more dives for her to go

1:54:57.469,1:55:04.489
or over a vertical thrown up a load of

1:55:01.219,1:55:07.850
splash up until that point my Nakagawa

1:55:04.489,1:55:10.640
had been very very steady and very solid

1:55:07.850,1:55:13.699
whilst those around her were faltering

1:55:10.640,1:55:16.670
she seemed to be unwavering but this one

1:55:13.699,1:55:19.090
a little bit wavy and there's a wave as

1:55:16.670,1:55:21.230
she goes in throwing up a load of splash

1:55:19.090,1:55:24.610
that's a great shot isn't it super

1:55:21.230,1:55:24.610
slow-mo London 2012

1:55:28.210,1:55:35.449
Maia Maia give us a wave not with those

1:55:31.969,1:55:39.800
scores five point five and forty seven

1:55:35.449,1:55:42.830
point eight five again I said that not

1:55:39.800,1:55:44.810
what she would have wanted like passing

1:55:42.830,1:55:47.719
the baton right I'm not doing very well

1:55:44.810,1:55:49.370
your turn now Kim suji it's around

1:55:47.719,1:55:53.480
things off reverse two and a half seven

1:55:49.370,1:55:55.699
sorts oh that's so best I've why I was

1:55:53.480,1:55:57.949
maybe you heard it I took a sharp intake

1:55:55.699,1:56:00.050
of breath as she took off I wasn't sure

1:55:57.949,1:56:01.430
which way up she was gonna land but

1:56:00.050,1:56:03.890
whether her feet were gonna come close

1:56:01.430,1:56:06.250
to the diving board which they do a

1:56:03.890,1:56:09.739
little bit she hangs on in there

1:56:06.250,1:56:13.100
squeezing in and then yep she blocks it

1:56:09.739,1:56:15.010
on her head safely and securely for her

1:56:13.100,1:56:17.600
best diver this contest

1:56:15.010,1:56:19.190
sadly she has so much ground to make up

1:56:17.600,1:56:21.920
she has she hasn't made up any ground at

1:56:19.190,1:56:22.670
all in terms of position because she was

1:56:21.920,1:56:26.140
26th

1:56:22.670,1:56:26.140
she is 26th

1:56:27.260,1:56:30.860
but good much better brought the smile

1:56:29.510,1:56:36.050
back to her face and all most of the

1:56:30.860,1:56:38.989
coaches we're not quite end-of-round for

1:56:36.050,1:56:43.190
a shake-up in that round wasn't there

1:56:38.989,1:56:49.219
Chen from roben hang up to third you

1:56:43.190,1:56:55.130
know Chinese Hugh is down to sink so 264

1:56:49.219,1:56:55.639
in 9th place who's an 18 and and is an

1:56:55.130,1:56:58.159
18

1:56:55.639,1:57:00.230
none of the Brits in the top 18 at the

1:56:58.159,1:57:03.230
moment how much do they have to do to

1:57:00.230,1:57:06.610
make up the ground are they cast adrift

1:57:03.230,1:57:10.039
or can they repair the damage take a lot

1:57:06.610,1:57:12.739
mone cladding in 20th place and Stacy

1:57:10.039,1:57:16.539
Powell in 22nd anybody pretty much below

1:57:12.739,1:57:16.539
that is out of the competition

1:57:19.420,1:57:25.219
well our standard of the men's three

1:57:23.000,1:57:27.050
mates in last night was exemplary and

1:57:25.219,1:57:28.579
hurts on the edge of our seats we're

1:57:27.050,1:57:31.130
kind of waiting for this competition to

1:57:28.579,1:57:34.760
come to life hasn't done yet but there's

1:57:31.130,1:57:38.510
so much still to be done and so many

1:57:34.760,1:57:41.420
twists and turns in the last round and

1:57:38.510,1:57:45.829
still more places to be gained a lot of

1:57:41.420,1:57:48.650
places to be lost top 18 remember ok

1:57:45.829,1:57:50.530
12th as Brittany viola is she is safe

1:57:48.650,1:57:54.949
but she got a feel for program and

1:57:50.530,1:57:57.769
underlying that fact we have a range of

1:57:54.949,1:57:59.389
dives from her to finish off the program

1:57:57.769,1:58:01.369
it's a back two and a half somersaults

1:57:59.389,1:58:05.469
one and a half twist with pike three

1:58:01.369,1:58:05.469
point two can she finish off in style

1:58:10.030,1:58:14.809
well yes she can very very good entry

1:58:12.949,1:58:18.980
into the water however I think she's

1:58:14.809,1:58:20.630
over twisted let's look at the replay

1:58:18.980,1:58:22.789
the judges kept well if they spot it

1:58:20.630,1:58:25.599
they should penalize for that the divers

1:58:22.789,1:58:28.400
should be square side on as you go in

1:58:25.599,1:58:29.960
there we are rocking and rolling a

1:58:28.400,1:58:31.639
little bit and I can see both ankles and

1:58:29.960,1:58:34.579
both Castor's she went in that means

1:58:31.639,1:58:38.230
that she's over twisted so the judges

1:58:34.579,1:58:38.230
could look at that rocking and rolling

1:58:38.920,1:58:43.340
not in a good way though like driving an

1:58:41.360,1:58:44.539
out-of-control bus but she managed to

1:58:43.340,1:58:46.699
square it up that's good

1:58:44.539,1:58:47.750
22 touch another chubby Checker's there

1:58:46.699,1:58:52.130
but she gets away with it

1:58:47.750,1:58:57.880
sevens for Brittany viola and she will

1:58:52.130,1:58:59.989
be returning in the semi-finals not a

1:58:57.880,1:59:04.820
statement I can make at the moment I'm

1:58:59.989,1:59:08.360
out Audrey LeBeau she could back two and

1:59:04.820,1:59:10.789
a half sour thoughts 1/2 twist 21st 3.2

1:59:08.360,1:59:14.960
degree of difficulty for the French

1:59:10.789,1:59:17.349
woman's a final dive oh I don't think

1:59:14.960,1:59:19.519
she'll be coming back with that

1:59:17.349,1:59:21.349
definitely not in fact if she was in

1:59:19.519,1:59:25.960
21st place which is what the scores

1:59:21.349,1:59:29.800
scoreboard says than that Wow

1:59:25.960,1:59:37.740
blown dive to finish bit of a shambles

1:59:29.800,1:59:37.740
oh what a shame short low scores

1:59:38.310,1:59:42.400
disappointing end come on I thought we

1:59:40.990,1:59:44.700
were gonna get a finish with a flourish

1:59:42.400,1:59:47.890
it's not happening firm miss Leveaux

1:59:44.700,1:59:55.240
Baga votes for mr. Taylor while we're at

1:59:47.890,2:00:00.910
it very 6.80 for Audrey LeBeau now Megan

1:59:55.240,2:00:02.920
in Fito next 14th a lot of Canadian

2:00:00.910,2:00:06.490
support both in the crown Dino watching

2:00:02.920,2:00:07.810
on TV as well she performs her back

2:00:06.490,2:00:11.260
two and a half somersaults one and a

2:00:07.810,2:00:15.550
half twist Pike position 3.2 yes to

2:00:11.260,2:00:17.140
confirm her semi-final place finally

2:00:15.550,2:00:19.450
someone who wants to get in the final

2:00:17.140,2:00:23.440
somebody wants to make it through who's

2:00:19.450,2:00:25.480
almost unscathed from this prelim not a

2:00:23.440,2:00:27.790
great day for Megan some good stuff and

2:00:25.480,2:00:29.860
then some very mediocre stuff on this

2:00:27.790,2:00:32.110
already Olympic bronze medalist from

2:00:29.860,2:00:34.390
last week the solid finish though

2:00:32.110,2:00:39.760
that'll get over 70 points and through

2:00:34.390,2:00:44.470
she goes yep puts the top of the pile

2:00:39.760,2:00:46.960
for the time being its qualification

2:00:44.470,2:00:49.270
well and truly achieved coach happy she

2:00:46.960,2:00:51.130
should be too and all the things she got

2:00:49.270,2:00:55.680
wrong tonight she can rectify again in

2:00:51.130,2:00:59.890
the morning general in olympic and world

2:00:55.680,2:01:01.150
champion in position number ones you

2:00:59.890,2:01:03.490
might expect for somebody with those

2:01:01.150,2:01:07.620
accolades back two and a half

2:01:03.490,2:01:07.620
somersaults one hard twists to finish

2:01:09.070,2:01:14.650
yep no mistakes all night from cherylin

2:01:13.090,2:01:15.910
although she hasn't been top of a game

2:01:14.650,2:01:18.880
if she doesn't really need to she is

2:01:15.910,2:01:21.250
head and shoulders and miles I in front

2:01:18.880,2:01:23.800
of everyone else and she should be a

2:01:21.250,2:01:25.030
clear Victor by well over 50 points one

2:01:23.800,2:01:28.900
and a half twist two and a half

2:01:25.030,2:01:32.890
somersaults vertical entry and hardly

2:01:28.900,2:01:34.540
any splash you can see why she's olympic

2:01:32.890,2:01:37.390
and world champion it bitch have been

2:01:34.540,2:01:40.030
only 15 she's now grand old age of 19

2:01:37.390,2:01:43.410
and she'll be tough to beat

2:01:40.030,2:01:46.360
she is currently not only number one but

2:01:43.410,2:01:48.940
67 points ahead of Megan Ben feet oh

2:01:46.360,2:01:51.760
that's how much better she has been

2:01:48.940,2:01:58.480
diving and the top Canadian at the

2:01:51.760,2:02:02.950
moment Julia we got Chuck night after

2:01:58.480,2:02:05.380
round 4 time to line her transition into

2:02:02.950,2:02:06.400
the last 18 back to and half somersaults

2:02:05.380,2:02:06.730
one and a half twist you've seen it

2:02:06.400,2:02:10.900
before

2:02:06.730,2:02:13.060
and it comes again she's she's done some

2:02:10.900,2:02:16.480
fantastic dives and that one isn't one

2:02:13.060,2:02:19.230
of them unfortunately Wow hard work had

2:02:16.480,2:02:21.760
been done just making a bit of a

2:02:19.230,2:02:23.110
misjudgment on the finish one and a half

2:02:21.760,2:02:24.880
twist into the two and a half

2:02:23.110,2:02:28.150
somersaults stretches forward too far

2:02:24.880,2:02:30.370
ends up short and under twisted so

2:02:28.150,2:02:32.110
she'll get sixes and 6.5 to do it of a

2:02:30.370,2:02:37.900
disappointing finish for this young girl

2:02:32.110,2:02:39.670
here I can see both anchors again the

2:02:37.900,2:02:45.150
judges may even people while they've

2:02:39.670,2:02:48.130
gone with her it's okay yeah total mark

2:02:45.150,2:02:50.290
60 point eight zero and 324 will be

2:02:48.130,2:02:53.440
enough to see her through now Stacy

2:02:50.290,2:02:55.870
Powell proud doing everything they can

2:02:53.440,2:02:58.810
to lift her first of the British

2:02:55.870,2:03:01.720
competitors but this has to be her best

2:02:58.810,2:03:03.310
dive of the night by some way and

2:03:01.720,2:03:06.370
whereas this will be the end of Stacie's

2:03:03.310,2:03:09.070
competition for places outside

2:03:06.370,2:03:12.190
qualification and the marks are there

2:03:09.070,2:03:14.020
for her if she can get this right back

2:03:12.190,2:03:16.210
two and a half somersaults and one and a

2:03:14.020,2:03:19.780
half twists used to be a high degree of

2:03:16.210,2:03:27.789
difficulty very high three point two

2:03:19.780,2:03:30.250
for Britain's Stacy Powell well that's

2:03:27.789,2:03:33.730
more like it she really really needed to

2:03:30.250,2:03:35.949
pull it out the bag and she has now will

2:03:33.730,2:03:37.840
it be enough I'm not sure it's a really

2:03:35.949,2:03:41.320
really good dive it's gonna get eights

2:03:37.840,2:03:43.710
it may even get 8.5 s is the entry clean

2:03:41.320,2:03:47.380
enough to get eights from the judges

2:03:43.710,2:03:49.329
it's 3.2 I've seen it much better than

2:03:47.380,2:03:51.969
this just throwing up a little bit too

2:03:49.329,2:03:54.940
much splash maybe the judges won't go

2:03:51.969,2:03:56.829
with it finally she does a dive that

2:03:54.940,2:03:59.619
she's capable of but I think she might

2:03:56.829,2:04:01.900
have left it too late too much to do

2:03:59.619,2:04:04.960
yeah I'm not sure the mark that's coming

2:04:01.900,2:04:07.000
up here is gonna be good enough 70 point

2:04:04.960,2:04:11.980
4 0 she didn't get the eights you needed

2:04:07.000,2:04:13.750
on the 8.5 7.5 will accrue and Stacy I'm

2:04:11.980,2:04:15.130
afraid it looks like you will not be

2:04:13.750,2:04:16.030
returning in the semi finals but there's

2:04:15.130,2:04:19.770
still some room

2:04:16.030,2:04:22.360
other things to go wrong Naomi back e

2:04:19.770,2:04:25.960
2.7 lowest degree of difficulty we've

2:04:22.360,2:04:28.360
seen Reverse two and a half Oh

2:04:25.960,2:04:30.099
faltering on a final dive her lowest

2:04:28.360,2:04:31.750
degree of difficulty she was way up

2:04:30.099,2:04:33.789
there in the top end of the field

2:04:31.750,2:04:37.690
right in the business end of the field

2:04:33.789,2:04:39.309
and now she has well saved her worse for

2:04:37.690,2:04:40.900
last unfortunately here we go the

2:04:39.309,2:04:42.909
takeoff is good this is her best dive

2:04:40.900,2:04:45.570
normally when she kicks out way too late

2:04:42.909,2:04:51.690
way over look at that tidal wave

2:04:45.570,2:04:57.239
surfboard momen have a drink on us boys

2:04:51.690,2:04:57.239
44.5 5 for bat key

2:04:58.020,2:05:02.650
well she may already have done enough

2:05:00.670,2:05:06.760
anyway I'd have to be too concerned

2:05:02.650,2:05:10.239
about that last round dive to a fish

2:05:06.760,2:05:16.389
with a flourish and she hasn't Christine

2:05:10.239,2:05:18.670
Stewart after a great start twist right

2:05:16.389,2:05:23.500
and she will go for a for three and a

2:05:18.670,2:05:26.230
half several sorts with pike your superb

2:05:23.500,2:05:29.739
a rip head tree into the water the

2:05:26.230,2:05:31.030
vertical splash las' that's gonna get

2:05:29.739,2:05:32.560
some good marks from the judges even

2:05:31.030,2:05:35.199
though her takeoff is a little bit weak

2:05:32.560,2:05:36.909
she's not the most powerful of the women

2:05:35.199,2:05:38.739
here finishing a little bit low on the

2:05:36.909,2:05:41.679
water but that or get eights I'm sure

2:05:38.739,2:05:43.780
because of that superb entry that's the

2:05:41.679,2:05:46.060
best dive we've seen for christen this

2:05:43.780,2:05:48.370
evening what's your secure place in the

2:05:46.060,2:05:51.550
semi-final effortlessly with that one

2:05:48.370,2:05:57.190
yeah she had a very poor start 51.80 but

2:05:51.550,2:05:58.860
then 72 72 73 and 72 and yes smile can

2:05:57.190,2:06:03.310
remain there for a bit longer

2:05:58.860,2:06:09.639
because she will be returning now

2:06:03.310,2:06:15.389
Monique 20th position after around 4 she

2:06:09.639,2:06:19.000
has a few points to make up because the

2:06:15.389,2:06:20.460
equation is if she does it's like she

2:06:19.000,2:06:22.750
has done it I can do it

2:06:20.460,2:06:26.699
that's for three and a half somersault

2:06:22.750,2:06:33.960
could be her passage into the last 18

2:06:26.699,2:06:39.030
3.0 degree of difficulty looking

2:06:33.960,2:06:39.030
70 80 marks really put her there

2:06:52.739,2:06:59.250
oh yeah it's straight up and down

2:06:56.040,2:07:01.710
this occurred entry into the water so

2:06:59.250,2:07:03.719
will it be good enough will it be good

2:07:01.710,2:07:06.719
enough to cried of expecting the crowd

2:07:03.719,2:07:09.120
are wanting so she was in xx after the

2:07:06.719,2:07:11.430
previous rhinos only 3.0 degree of

2:07:09.120,2:07:14.280
difficulty that's a good time to finish

2:07:11.430,2:07:17.489
on she's clean into the water she

2:07:14.280,2:07:19.110
probably needs more than 7 and 7.5 s I

2:07:17.489,2:07:20.910
think that's what she's going to get

2:07:19.110,2:07:22.800
with that effort and she will have an

2:07:20.910,2:07:25.320
agonizing wait now looking at the

2:07:22.800,2:07:27.210
scoreboard to see whether her total

2:07:25.320,2:07:30.239
score we shall be on your screen shortly

2:07:27.210,2:07:33.360
is good enough to secure a spot in the

2:07:30.239,2:07:35.790
top 18 well she's gone over 300 which is

2:07:33.360,2:07:39.930
encouraging sixty seven point five zero

2:07:35.790,2:07:41.670
is quite encouraging its margins its

2:07:39.930,2:07:43.350
fractions and it could be very very

2:07:41.670,2:07:48.810
tight still she's giving herself a

2:07:43.350,2:07:50.400
chance who you Dan of China back two and

2:07:48.810,2:07:52.620
a half seven sorts one and a half twists

2:07:50.400,2:07:56.310
to finish with Pike position for the

2:07:52.620,2:07:59.790
second ranked Chinese and she's been

2:07:56.310,2:08:03.450
very mediocre today now that the you Dan

2:07:59.790,2:08:05.250
is normally something quite special I

2:08:03.450,2:08:07.770
would expect it to see her up pushing a

2:08:05.250,2:08:09.420
teammate Shin rule in but she's been way

2:08:07.770,2:08:12.390
off the pace today only in sixth after

2:08:09.420,2:08:14.690
the fourth round of dives I don't think

2:08:12.390,2:08:17.580
that's gonna move up the rankings at all

2:08:14.690,2:08:18.989
short she goes in thrown at the splash

2:08:17.580,2:08:21.360
and there's not much of her to throw up

2:08:18.989,2:08:23.219
splash so yeah she's off her game this

2:08:21.360,2:08:25.410
evening but she'll be back tomorrow in

2:08:23.219,2:08:28.290
the semi final well on our screen only

2:08:25.410,2:08:31.440
to have definitely qualified so far and

2:08:28.290,2:08:35.130
that is Chen of China and Christian step

2:08:31.440,2:08:38.100
we have a big queue beside us on the

2:08:35.130,2:08:40.170
scoreboard and it tells us who has made

2:08:38.100,2:08:42.780
it through as they make it through and

2:08:40.170,2:08:48.260
to have especially how tight this

2:08:42.780,2:08:52.550
competition is come on yang of Korea

2:08:48.260,2:08:55.710
People's Republic of Korea in 19th place

2:08:52.550,2:08:57.360
if this goes right she will have at

2:08:55.710,2:08:59.690
least five more dives in this

2:08:57.360,2:08:59.690
competition

2:09:00.170,2:09:07.940
oh I'm sure the whole of the British

2:09:06.320,2:09:09.770
team were holding their breath because

2:09:07.940,2:09:11.810
she was in 19th and of course Monique

2:09:09.770,2:09:13.160
cladding was in 20th her teammates

2:09:11.810,2:09:15.650
they're really getting behind her and

2:09:13.160,2:09:18.260
that was a very good dive to finish and

2:09:15.650,2:09:19.820
showing ladies been on for a couple of

2:09:18.260,2:09:21.650
dives and off for a couple and she's

2:09:19.820,2:09:23.540
finished on a good one there that's

2:09:21.650,2:09:28.580
gonna be very close I think that we'll

2:09:23.540,2:09:31.070
put it above Monique cladding and so Wow

2:09:28.580,2:09:32.510
well monix fine I'll be enough for her

2:09:31.070,2:09:35.120
to get through this young lady Kim

2:09:32.510,2:09:38.750
Mike's final die was sixty seven point

2:09:35.120,2:09:40.970
five zero and Kim's final dive was sixty

2:09:38.750,2:09:44.480
seven point two zero it was a big enough

2:09:40.970,2:09:46.790
margin between the two of them that's

2:09:44.480,2:09:49.280
not gonna close up sufficiently for

2:09:46.790,2:09:50.950
Monique at this stage when there are

2:09:49.280,2:09:53.510
others still to come

2:09:50.950,2:09:57.490
could falter along the way Brittany

2:09:53.510,2:10:00.350
roben looked pretty impeccable so far

2:09:57.490,2:10:01.790
mr. finish back two and a half seven

2:10:00.350,2:10:05.060
sorts one and a half twists for the

2:10:01.790,2:10:06.980
young Australian well she's just a

2:10:05.060,2:10:09.110
little bit short she went in that she's

2:10:06.980,2:10:11.570
been really really impressive not

2:10:09.110,2:10:13.070
finishing on her best I've oak well

2:10:11.570,2:10:14.780
certainly she didn't perform that dive

2:10:13.070,2:10:16.520
at her best I was watching this in

2:10:14.780,2:10:19.340
training and it was certainly better

2:10:16.520,2:10:21.410
than this finishing a little bit low on

2:10:19.340,2:10:24.020
the water means that she's short she

2:10:21.410,2:10:25.490
goes in that's a poor effort by her

2:10:24.020,2:10:28.190
standards to finish off the competition

2:10:25.490,2:10:31.880
but she was way up there in the top

2:10:28.190,2:10:33.830
three almost after four finds well it

2:10:31.880,2:10:36.170
might be her lowest mark of the evening

2:10:33.830,2:10:39.950
it is fifty seven point six zero but she

2:10:36.170,2:10:42.770
has qualified as has who of China so

2:10:39.950,2:10:43.250
both the Chinese through only four have

2:10:42.770,2:10:46.010
yet

2:10:43.250,2:10:49.280
don't be queue beside their name to

2:10:46.010,2:10:52.360
indicate that they are through so still

2:10:49.280,2:10:55.930
plenty of positions up for grabs

2:10:52.360,2:10:58.370
speciali the 2.8 is not gonna get there

2:10:55.930,2:11:02.080
back one and a half somersaults to an

2:10:58.370,2:11:04.820
art West 24th place have to be the best

2:11:02.080,2:11:08.110
like one and a half she's ever done but

2:11:04.820,2:11:08.110
even though it probably wouldn't make it

2:11:08.220,2:11:13.310
no it's a nice time to finish but no

2:11:10.440,2:11:19.020
semi-final place for Brenda

2:11:13.310,2:11:22.350
Pazhani from Italy she's been okay this

2:11:19.020,2:11:23.940
evening but a few errors early on when

2:11:22.350,2:11:26.730
that she's left herself too much to do

2:11:23.940,2:11:28.730
low tariff dive to finish 2.8 and she

2:11:26.730,2:11:31.830
won't be featuring in tomorrow morning's

2:11:28.730,2:11:33.900
semi-final so their job at the Royal

2:11:31.830,2:11:35.160
Albert Hall probably up for grabs

2:11:33.900,2:11:39.590
she can go and conduct the orchestra

2:11:35.160,2:11:39.590
after that way for Brenda

2:11:48.040,2:11:57.290
next up is Karolina Hernandez of Mexico

2:11:54.980,2:12:00.760
and she is right on the last

2:11:57.290,2:12:03.830
qualification position no pressure them

2:12:00.760,2:12:06.800
18th place back two and a half

2:12:03.830,2:12:08.510
somersaults one and a half twists she

2:12:06.800,2:12:11.120
and Manik take a long time over their

2:12:08.510,2:12:14.230
preparation thinking about making a cup

2:12:11.120,2:12:14.230
of tea now might be a good time

2:12:30.010,2:12:35.540
all there you go so she was an 18th

2:12:33.020,2:12:37.220
after the 4th rounds and that is not

2:12:35.540,2:12:39.200
gonna help her campaign she will move

2:12:37.220,2:12:41.690
down the ranks with that that does help

2:12:39.200,2:12:43.280
some of the other women certainly money

2:12:41.690,2:12:46.490
cladding who is watching now the

2:12:43.280,2:12:48.200
scoreboard and hoping that she can make

2:12:46.490,2:12:50.840
it through there's nothing money can do

2:12:48.200,2:12:52.690
now but this young lady has just taken

2:12:50.840,2:12:55.310
herself out of contention

2:12:52.690,2:12:59.660
it's not work for her that's twice now

2:12:55.310,2:13:01.580
she's a laborious Lea long build-up to

2:12:59.660,2:13:04.700
that dive and it's not work firm when

2:13:01.580,2:13:07.610
she went quicker more quickly she'd much

2:13:04.700,2:13:09.020
better I don't quite that's the way she

2:13:07.610,2:13:11.570
does it didn't really work for her

2:13:09.020,2:13:12.140
tonight four point five and she moves

2:13:11.570,2:13:16.100
below

2:13:12.140,2:13:19.010
Monica cladding in the standings so

2:13:16.100,2:13:23.150
Malik has made up one place a couple

2:13:19.010,2:13:26.660
Chuck has qualified as we move on to

2:13:23.150,2:13:31.490
Rosalie and filly on 17th for Canada no

2:13:26.660,2:13:32.060
room for error no margin for mistakes no

2:13:31.490,2:13:34.940
mistakes

2:13:32.060,2:13:36.650
that will keep her in the top 18 which

2:13:34.940,2:13:38.810
of course is where she wants to be

2:13:36.650,2:13:41.180
hasn't had the best day on the diving

2:13:38.810,2:13:42.740
boards here today we can expect to see

2:13:41.180,2:13:45.620
so much more from this lady

2:13:42.740,2:13:47.480
of course she's an Olympic medalist

2:13:45.620,2:13:49.400
already last week in the synchro

2:13:47.480,2:13:51.530
competition with the fellow Canadian

2:13:49.400,2:13:55.760
who's also featured here today making

2:13:51.530,2:13:57.290
benefit oh so hurry up Rosaline in on a

2:13:55.760,2:13:59.090
head and safety through to the

2:13:57.290,2:14:01.760
semi-finals good work from the Canadian

2:13:59.090,2:14:06.260
girls care something other divers would

2:14:01.760,2:14:07.640
buy that 7 7 and 7.5 off her just to

2:14:06.260,2:14:09.620
give themselves a bit of insurance a bit

2:14:07.640,2:14:12.700
of a buffer she's done what she had to

2:14:09.620,2:14:15.580
do and yeah yes from the coach and

2:14:12.700,2:14:18.400
she'll be returning

2:14:15.580,2:14:19.120
well just over 12 hours from now well

2:14:18.400,2:14:21.430
it's a whoo

2:14:19.120,2:14:23.470
to finish a back two and a half

2:14:21.430,2:14:27.030
somersaults one and a half twists eighth

2:14:23.470,2:14:30.220
place on her way

2:14:27.030,2:14:33.070
yep Melissa safely on her way all the

2:14:30.220,2:14:34.750
way through into the semi-finals she's

2:14:33.070,2:14:36.450
been pretty steady this evening that's

2:14:34.750,2:14:40.270
what you needed to do to get through

2:14:36.450,2:14:42.640
unscathed we'll certainly see Melissa in

2:14:40.270,2:14:44.400
tomorrow morning's semi final hope you

2:14:42.640,2:14:46.810
can join us then

2:14:44.400,2:14:50.170
well I think the standard will have

2:14:46.810,2:14:53.680
improved sufficiently and quite markedly

2:14:50.170,2:14:55.360
from what we're seeing tonight even

2:14:53.680,2:14:57.250
though it will be early morning dives

2:14:55.360,2:14:59.410
for the divers which I don't

2:14:57.250,2:15:03.330
particularly like you might see a few

2:14:59.410,2:15:03.330
more of them on their game in the semi

2:15:03.420,2:15:08.320
there the marks for Melissa wood in

2:15:06.010,2:15:13.990
Australian contingent are vocal and

2:15:08.320,2:15:18.280
numerous and 72 is what she gets now

2:15:13.990,2:15:19.600
Maria curry up of Germany 10th place

2:15:18.280,2:15:25.210
she's probably over performed if

2:15:19.600,2:15:27.580
anything tonight 2.9 nice steady secrets

2:15:25.210,2:15:33.340
of dies from hurt back two and a half

2:15:27.580,2:15:35.590
somersaults yep very steady and she just

2:15:33.340,2:15:38.260
bunks that one on her head just as she

2:15:35.590,2:15:41.740
needs to to make it through safely yeah

2:15:38.260,2:15:43.270
very steady solid last round dive 2.9

2:15:41.740,2:15:45.370
and the backward two-and-a-half in the

2:15:43.270,2:15:47.740
pike position she knows where she is

2:15:45.370,2:15:49.420
points to toes back up towards the five

2:15:47.740,2:15:55.470
round the five meter height and then

2:15:49.420,2:15:55.470
drifts back glides back fake it

2:15:55.680,2:16:01.210
certainly good enough for a semi-final

2:15:58.300,2:16:03.670
place underlining her 10th position from

2:16:01.210,2:16:09.100
the previous round still 10th with about

2:16:03.670,2:16:12.940
sixty two point three five when he

2:16:09.100,2:16:16.540
competed in the synchro now in the

2:16:12.940,2:16:18.250
individual she's picking up more where

2:16:16.540,2:16:22.910
she left off them from the synchro she's

2:16:18.250,2:16:26.630
gonna act together tonight and hang

2:16:22.910,2:16:28.160
back two and a half of hurt you had the

2:16:26.630,2:16:29.990
back turn half with one and a half twist

2:16:28.160,2:16:31.370
lots of the girls finishing on this one

2:16:29.990,2:16:33.500
almost landed on the camera down there

2:16:31.370,2:16:35.120
as she went so deep into the water

2:16:33.500,2:16:36.650
some of you can see this were some of

2:16:35.120,2:16:38.240
you asking about the sprays and sprays

2:16:36.650,2:16:40.190
of course disturb the surface of the

2:16:38.240,2:16:41.690
water so as planned until comes around

2:16:40.190,2:16:43.760
here she can see exactly where the

2:16:41.690,2:16:45.590
surface of the water is to grab her

2:16:43.760,2:16:48.050
hands and punch the entry into the water

2:16:45.590,2:16:49.820
she said a great job out there today and

2:16:48.050,2:16:51.790
she'll certainly be one of the top

2:16:49.820,2:16:54.790
qualifiers as we go through to the

2:16:51.790,2:16:54.790
semi-finals

2:16:55.030,2:17:00.740
swinging for her marks to come up before

2:16:57.320,2:17:05.270
I can confirm her progression yeah in

2:17:00.740,2:17:09.770
Fito brag up Chuck that key and she goes

2:17:05.270,2:17:15.050
in as the second-highest qualifier so

2:17:09.770,2:17:23.860
far by hm so so far we have ten people

2:17:15.050,2:17:23.860
who have confirmed their place Kim

2:17:23.950,2:17:32.610
Jim okay and she 16th after Ralph or oh

2:17:34.320,2:17:39.250
that's very good that is good enough to

2:17:37.450,2:17:41.410
secure a place or teammates were on

2:17:39.250,2:17:45.100
their feet and so they should be she's

2:17:41.410,2:17:46.930
been working hard out there today very

2:17:45.100,2:17:49.750
good quality dives and this is one of

2:17:46.930,2:17:51.850
them but gets 70 points on this and if

2:17:49.750,2:17:57.640
it does she will make it through to the

2:17:51.850,2:18:00.219
semi-final job done wait for the judges

2:17:57.640,2:18:04.210
to input their marks it's about to

2:18:00.219,2:18:07.090
appear on your screen and here they come

2:18:04.210,2:18:09.760
7.5 s and a seven seventy point four

2:18:07.090,2:18:12.790
zero yeah the big Q is beside her name

2:18:09.760,2:18:18.910
she's the 11th qualifier for the

2:18:12.790,2:18:19.510
semi-final not likely to include and yet

2:18:18.910,2:18:21.969
Rivera

2:18:19.510,2:18:26.580
of Cuba but she's got a program to

2:18:21.969,2:18:26.580
finish off and yes that died again

2:18:27.040,2:18:33.349
and that's a bed of effort from for

2:18:30.260,2:18:35.750
money up she's had a tough day out there

2:18:33.349,2:18:37.370
today some of her dives well Oliver dies

2:18:35.750,2:18:40.340
actually going to miss this one is her

2:18:37.370,2:18:43.160
best dive of the competition lots of the

2:18:40.340,2:18:44.750
girls finishing on this one back two and

2:18:43.160,2:18:47.870
a half somersaults with one and a half

2:18:44.750,2:18:49.849
twist I'm taping on the shins there may

2:18:47.870,2:18:50.989
be suffering some shin splints quite

2:18:49.849,2:18:53.689
common in divers because they're

2:18:50.989,2:18:55.550
constantly doing exercises order to make

2:18:53.689,2:18:57.800
their jumps more explosive as if they

2:18:55.550,2:19:03.250
were heard low or a sprint up causing

2:18:57.800,2:19:08.080
great strain there we go Olympic prelim

2:19:03.250,2:19:10.340
complete 57.6 ceremony cladding waiting

2:19:08.080,2:19:11.179
nothing she can do now she's had her

2:19:10.340,2:19:13.399
five dives

2:19:11.179,2:19:17.450
she's reliant on everybody else not

2:19:13.399,2:19:22.670
getting over that 18 threshold diver

2:19:17.450,2:19:25.460
ranked 23 after round four Tracy took it

2:19:22.670,2:19:27.349
on Malaysia and it's that dive again a

2:19:25.460,2:19:32.300
lot of the divers in the final round

2:19:27.349,2:19:34.670
opting for the back two and a half more

2:19:32.300,2:19:36.080
very good time there for Tracy she yeah

2:19:34.670,2:19:37.939
as struggled a little bit out there but

2:19:36.080,2:19:40.460
she's finished very very strongly

2:19:37.939,2:19:41.809
they're like two and a half somersaults

2:19:40.460,2:19:43.670
one and a half twist you're getting used

2:19:41.809,2:19:45.979
to this one now three point two degree

2:19:43.670,2:19:48.349
of difficulty maps into the one and a

2:19:45.979,2:19:50.330
half twist and there she is into the

2:19:48.349,2:19:52.340
water vertically with hardly any splash

2:19:50.330,2:19:54.560
that's a great dive to finish but just

2:19:52.340,2:19:59.149
left herself too much to do to make it

2:19:54.560,2:20:01.970
through to the semi-finals up to 18th

2:19:59.149,2:20:04.160
for the time being but there are many

2:20:01.970,2:20:07.189
more divers to go Tanaka still further

2:20:04.160,2:20:10.609
down so she will not be returning bras

2:20:07.189,2:20:12.260
meaningfully on has confirmed her return

2:20:10.609,2:20:15.800
in the semis

2:20:12.260,2:20:20.990
seven point five and seven as the

2:20:15.800,2:20:22.700
Malaysian finishes off campaign okay

2:20:20.990,2:20:25.420
this young lady will win a few hearts

2:20:22.700,2:20:28.460
just by her preparation alone tonight

2:20:25.420,2:20:30.529
it's been entertaining the diving has

2:20:28.460,2:20:33.290
been its bit erratic but she's got it

2:20:30.529,2:20:34.609
together towards the end 13th place she

2:20:33.290,2:20:37.700
can't see the face on this one now we

2:20:34.609,2:20:38.870
can back two and a half somersaults one

2:20:37.700,2:20:41.770
half twist like we're having a

2:20:38.870,2:20:41.770
conversation here Katie

2:20:46.710,2:20:52.420
well whatever she's doing certainly

2:20:49.030,2:20:54.399
working for it the past three dives that

2:20:52.420,2:20:59.350
she's performed have been very good

2:20:54.399,2:21:01.630
indeed he's 78 point 78 points and this

2:20:59.350,2:21:06.010
one I think will be in the 70s once

2:21:01.630,2:21:07.689
again lots of divers opting you just a

2:21:06.010,2:21:09.970
little bit over vertical as she goes in

2:21:07.689,2:21:12.670
but that's gonna scooter continuing up

2:21:09.970,2:21:22.260
the leaderboard she will certainly be in

2:21:12.670,2:21:25.840
the top ten yeah we look forward to the

2:21:22.260,2:21:30.990
continuation of the Katie Bell chat show

2:21:25.840,2:21:33.220
tomorrow and she's through with that 72

2:21:30.990,2:21:38.260
she's probably bit of a chatterbox don't

2:21:33.220,2:21:39.640
you know Espinoza Sanchez I think for me

2:21:38.260,2:21:41.290
that's biggest disappointment of the

2:21:39.640,2:21:43.930
night but she will be back for more

2:21:41.290,2:21:49.540
provided everything goes to plan on this

2:21:43.930,2:21:51.189
back two and a half with pike no it's a

2:21:49.540,2:21:53.500
back two and a half somersaults with one

2:21:51.189,2:21:57.220
and a half twist three point two degree

2:21:53.500,2:21:58.540
of difficulty this is an important I for

2:21:57.220,2:22:03.100
her to finish on and she needed to

2:21:58.540,2:22:04.660
finish very well which she does we

2:22:03.100,2:22:06.880
expected to see more from this young

2:22:04.660,2:22:09.370
lady and I'm sure we will tomorrow she's

2:22:06.880,2:22:10.899
made it through relatively comfortably

2:22:09.370,2:22:11.970
in the end I'm pretty sure that will put

2:22:10.899,2:22:14.740
him in the top 12

2:22:11.970,2:22:16.810
after a very shaky first two round dive

2:22:14.740,2:22:21.010
she's back in the mix with that final

2:22:16.810,2:22:25.600
dive I'd give you an idea 39.6 in round

2:22:21.010,2:22:27.609
two but back to normality to expect from

2:22:25.600,2:22:30.130
the bronze medalist from last year oh I

2:22:27.609,2:22:31.720
can't have had down for a medal in this

2:22:30.130,2:22:34.810
competition but she hasn't really backed

2:22:31.720,2:22:38.439
up my statement with performance tonight

2:22:34.810,2:22:40.750
but that's okay Manik to the fans at

2:22:38.439,2:22:44.859
home desperately hoping you there she's

2:22:40.750,2:22:51.021
17 for the moment and also Nova's gonna

2:22:44.859,2:22:53.150
go above up round

2:22:51.021,2:22:54.351
yep there's a bit splashy she goes in

2:22:53.150,2:23:00.650
but that would be good enough to take

2:22:54.351,2:23:03.320
her through through the semi-final mr.

2:23:00.650,2:23:05.660
haire bounder she went in there hair

2:23:03.320,2:23:08.000
tied out the way to get right in your

2:23:05.660,2:23:09.771
face if you were doing multiple twisting

2:23:08.000,2:23:17.840
multiple somersaulting dives which she

2:23:09.771,2:23:21.650
is safely through marks please judges

2:23:17.840,2:23:23.360
here they come 64 for Colton over I

2:23:21.650,2:23:24.771
think she wanted a bit more than that my

2:23:23.360,2:23:26.721
look on her Facebook doesn't matter

2:23:24.771,2:23:34.250
because she can get more tomorrow when

2:23:26.721,2:23:37.400
she returns for the semi-final ill but

2:23:34.250,2:23:39.410
if this goes well for like a Gow up

2:23:37.400,2:23:43.130
there will be no British representation

2:23:39.410,2:23:48.370
in the semi-final it's back to and half

2:23:43.130,2:23:50.260
again cladding on the edge of her seat

2:23:48.370,2:23:52.600
well it's good to back two and a half

2:23:50.260,2:23:55.109
somersaults one and a half twist in the

2:23:52.600,2:23:58.540
pike position lots of girls using this

2:23:55.109,2:24:02.070
13.2 and that's Nakagawa through to the

2:23:58.540,2:24:04.720
semi-final with a solid last round dive

2:24:02.070,2:24:09.660
let's have a look what that does to the

2:24:04.720,2:24:12.340
standings and where it moves people to

2:24:09.660,2:24:14.530
look at that overhead shot just showing

2:24:12.340,2:24:16.720
you what they're the girls are

2:24:14.530,2:24:19.000
attempting to do impressive

2:24:16.720,2:24:21.220
well that 70 point four zero means the

2:24:19.000,2:24:23.530
home fan to have nobody's to support

2:24:21.220,2:24:25.689
they have to adopt somebody in the

2:24:23.530,2:24:31.330
semi-final because both Monique landing

2:24:25.689,2:24:34.660
and Stacy foul outside the top 18 as we

2:24:31.330,2:24:41.680
welcome for the final time the last

2:24:34.660,2:24:44.800
diver in Korea and she'll go for same

2:24:41.680,2:24:46.780
dive to finish well the youngest

2:24:44.800,2:24:51.640
competitor finishes up the polymerase

2:24:46.780,2:24:53.320
only 14 years old and I'm sure well she

2:24:51.640,2:24:55.750
must have enjoyed every second what an

2:24:53.320,2:24:58.330
absolute privilege to come and compete

2:24:55.750,2:25:00.700
at the Olympic Games when you're only 14

2:24:58.330,2:25:02.590
years old just over a vertical as she

2:25:00.700,2:25:04.210
goes in there she's gonna finish bottom

2:25:02.590,2:25:05.410
of the pile and she's been there all

2:25:04.210,2:25:07.750
competition

2:25:05.410,2:25:10.660
I hope she's enjoyed her Olympic

2:25:07.750,2:25:12.609
experience and coaches applauding her

2:25:10.660,2:25:17.380
efforts and that's a competition

2:25:12.609,2:25:21.100
complete she will finish at the bottom

2:25:17.380,2:25:24.359
of the standings tomorrow face though

2:25:21.100,2:25:24.359
she seems to have enjoyed the experience

2:25:26.870,2:25:34.190
and Allah you will be returning and 2nd

2:25:31.130,2:25:39.910
place 2nd place qualifier for the

2:25:34.190,2:25:42.110
Malaysian still chatting away hey RC

2:25:39.910,2:25:43.880
you're right old chatterbox aren't you

2:25:42.110,2:25:45.380
it's funny really this one of the

2:25:43.880,2:25:47.360
smallest divers in the contest has the

2:25:45.380,2:25:51.830
tallest coach with her it gives you such

2:25:47.360,2:25:54.920
a contrast isn't it so here we go the

2:25:51.830,2:25:57.860
standings after round 5 the final round

2:25:54.920,2:26:01.070
in the women's team meets a platform and

2:25:57.860,2:26:04.580
most of the big names are through pretty

2:26:01.070,2:26:08.990
much all the big names are through China

2:26:04.580,2:26:10.280
at the top China in 6th now this is the

2:26:08.990,2:26:12.141
agonizing wait for those who don't
