0:00:00.000,0:00:05.100
um the final is tonight we have 18

0:00:02.460,0:00:07.859
divers and 12 of them will make it

0:00:05.100,0:00:09.960
through to tonight's showpiece final

0:00:07.859,0:00:12.509
well it only seems like yesterday we

0:00:09.960,0:00:13.219
were here in fact it was it was last

0:00:12.509,0:00:15.360
night

0:00:13.219,0:00:18.539
qualification finished well after 10

0:00:15.360,0:00:18.930
o'clock UK time now it's just before 10

0:00:18.539,0:00:22.170
a.m.

0:00:18.930,0:00:25.380
and 18 of last night's 32 divers back

0:00:22.170,0:00:27.000
here and ready to compete again taking

0:00:25.380,0:00:29.609
the traveling time to and from the

0:00:27.000,0:00:32.009
athletes village these divers like Tom

0:00:29.609,0:00:34.290
Daley here will be lucky to have got 6

0:00:32.009,0:00:37.050
or 7 hours sleep the British diver

0:00:34.290,0:00:40.620
getting a massive round of applause from

0:00:37.050,0:00:41.879
another impressive crowd here Tom Daley

0:00:40.620,0:00:44.660
was one of the divers who have an

0:00:41.879,0:00:47.780
inconsistent evening in qualification

0:00:44.660,0:00:50.520
Steve ravillious alongside me yet again

0:00:47.780,0:00:53.430
often sleep cheering for the local hero

0:00:50.520,0:00:55.530
dies down and Steve how surprise to you

0:00:53.430,0:00:58.430
at this schedule they're back here so

0:00:55.530,0:01:00.840
quickly aren't they they are and I just

0:00:58.430,0:01:03.180
worry that it doesn't allow the athletes

0:01:00.840,0:01:05.189
to give of their best because as you

0:01:03.180,0:01:08.159
point out we finished here about 10 20

0:01:05.189,0:01:11.040
10 15 last night they may have got back

0:01:08.159,0:01:12.630
to the village by 11 they may have

0:01:11.040,0:01:14.340
needed a massage something to eat if

0:01:12.630,0:01:15.689
they got to sleep by midnight I'd be

0:01:14.340,0:01:19.470
very surprised and then they're going to

0:01:15.689,0:01:22.049
be up by 6:00 6:30 and operating on six

0:01:19.470,0:01:25.710
hours sleep it's just not ideal so the

0:01:22.049,0:01:27.360
scheduling is curious at best and it was

0:01:25.710,0:01:28.829
a very long session last night that they

0:01:27.360,0:01:30.030
had and in fact during that there would

0:01:28.829,0:01:31.770
have been maybe a couple of these guys

0:01:30.030,0:01:33.780
required to do a drug test which would

0:01:31.770,0:01:36.299
have held them back even further so the

0:01:33.780,0:01:39.840
scheduling has raised a few eyebrows but

0:01:36.299,0:01:41.430
I think that said we're in for a great

0:01:39.840,0:01:43.950
competition if last night's is anything

0:01:41.430,0:01:46.409
to go by and the two Chinese boys are

0:01:43.950,0:01:49.439
going to be very difficult to to remove

0:01:46.409,0:01:52.020
from top spot linear and Chabot were

0:01:49.439,0:01:53.579
absolutely outstanding with their skill

0:01:52.020,0:01:57.890
level and their consistency across the

0:01:53.579,0:02:01.140
six stars yes the dive order today is

0:01:57.890,0:02:04.140
seeded from yesterday's qualification

0:02:01.140,0:02:06.960
process still get the feeling it doesn't

0:02:04.140,0:02:10.500
really reflect the true talent that's

0:02:06.960,0:02:13.720
out there in the diving pool the

0:02:10.500,0:02:16.330
Mexicans and the Germans had excellent

0:02:13.720,0:02:17.860
evenings like Martin Fortran who got

0:02:16.330,0:02:20.320
themselves in good positions and can

0:02:17.860,0:02:23.950
watch the dives unfold last night's

0:02:20.320,0:02:26.620
competition with 32 divers took more

0:02:23.950,0:02:29.200
than three hours to compete so there was

0:02:26.620,0:02:31.690
half an hour wait between each die for

0:02:29.200,0:02:33.700
each diver and interesting to read some

0:02:31.690,0:02:35.740
of the overnight quotes from the divers

0:02:33.700,0:02:37.030
saying how difficult they found it and

0:02:35.740,0:02:38.650
didn't know quite how to handle it

0:02:37.030,0:02:41.770
Matthew Mitchum said a really

0:02:38.650,0:02:43.900
experienced diver like like himself Tom

0:02:41.770,0:02:46.060
Daley who has very inconsistent said

0:02:43.900,0:02:47.860
that his legs felt tired at the end and

0:02:46.060,0:02:50.530
I've got a feeling we really haven't

0:02:47.860,0:02:53.500
seen the real competition emerge

0:02:50.530,0:02:54.970
apart from as you said those two Chinese

0:02:53.500,0:02:57.250
superstars at the top of the order

0:02:54.970,0:02:59.200
another indication that for some at

0:02:57.250,0:03:02.590
least it was a long night three of the

0:02:59.200,0:03:06.760
top six divers their last dive was their

0:03:02.590,0:03:10.630
worst and then look at someone like glib

0:03:06.760,0:03:12.670
galperin who just staggered across the

0:03:10.630,0:03:15.100
line in the end but he's ranking across

0:03:12.670,0:03:17.220
the night he started second then second

0:03:15.100,0:03:21.160
after the second dive then fifth fifth

0:03:17.220,0:03:22.570
15th and 16th and he only just made it

0:03:21.160,0:03:25.360
so there you see glib galperin the

0:03:22.570,0:03:28.450
Russian going off third which means he

0:03:25.360,0:03:31.180
was third last to qualify and this was a

0:03:28.450,0:03:33.850
surprising performance but indicative of

0:03:31.180,0:03:36.010
the inconsistency we saw well last night

0:03:33.850,0:03:38.769
many of these chopped dry divers who can

0:03:36.010,0:03:41.350
pull out a top scoring performance with

0:03:38.769,0:03:43.090
one single effort had a little bit of

0:03:41.350,0:03:44.709
slack in their program they could afford

0:03:43.090,0:03:46.269
maybe to dip their standards a little

0:03:44.709,0:03:48.130
bit but now we're getting to this

0:03:46.269,0:03:51.430
semi-final stage and even more so

0:03:48.130,0:03:55.330
tonight a mistake a poor dive will be

0:03:51.430,0:03:57.459
really costly I really think we're going

0:03:55.330,0:03:59.920
to see the whole level crank up here

0:03:57.459,0:04:03.820
this morning and certainly the pressure

0:03:59.920,0:04:05.830
will increase those laps is not going to

0:04:03.820,0:04:09.070
be allowed it was a long line for the

0:04:05.830,0:04:10.570
judges to who have to assess these dives

0:04:09.070,0:04:13.480
so have one look at it they don't get

0:04:10.570,0:04:16.330
the advantage of the excellent TV

0:04:13.480,0:04:19.000
replays which we can all enjoy seven

0:04:16.330,0:04:21.459
judges the top two and the bottom two

0:04:19.000,0:04:23.710
marks are discounted it's very clear

0:04:21.459,0:04:26.230
when you see the score captions come up

0:04:23.710,0:04:29.020
at the end of each dive and

0:04:26.230,0:04:32.590
the only ones who really manage that

0:04:29.020,0:04:35.770
terrific consistency were lin dawei here

0:04:32.590,0:04:38.290
and chuubo his chinese compatriot they

0:04:35.770,0:04:40.480
were incredible the big feature of these

0:04:38.290,0:04:43.510
Chinese diverts is they never seem to

0:04:40.480,0:04:48.700
let their standard drop excellent is

0:04:43.510,0:04:51.010
slight their bottom line now David

0:04:48.700,0:04:54.370
Boudia silver medalist at the World

0:04:51.010,0:04:56.140
Championships last year again someone

0:04:54.370,0:04:59.620
who had an inconsistent night he's come

0:04:56.140,0:05:02.890
in in the last place and so we'll go off

0:04:59.620,0:05:05.590
first and all the divers that have made

0:05:02.890,0:05:09.730
the semi-final are doing the same six

0:05:05.590,0:05:12.490
dives as they did in the qualifying the

0:05:09.730,0:05:15.370
preliminary we're gonna go look at Tom

0:05:12.490,0:05:16.990
Daley there he is the Great Britain

0:05:15.370,0:05:20.440
poster boy one of the faces of the

0:05:16.990,0:05:23.680
build-up to these London 2012 Olympic

0:05:20.440,0:05:27.100
Games been under tremendous pressure of

0:05:23.680,0:05:29.830
expectation and this crowd so many of

0:05:27.100,0:05:32.530
them who will probably be new to this

0:05:29.830,0:05:35.440
sport but they know it's spectacular and

0:05:32.530,0:05:38.440
they will be willing daily along after a

0:05:35.440,0:05:41.020
difficult evening for him but he's by no

0:05:38.440,0:05:47.530
means the only star of the show for you

0:05:41.020,0:05:50.140
to enjoy not far from a start then David

0:05:47.530,0:05:52.510
Boudia will lead us off with an arm

0:05:50.140,0:05:55.510
stand back double somersault two and a

0:05:52.510,0:05:58.150
half twists and different strategies

0:05:55.510,0:06:00.550
about where you put your high tariffs

0:05:58.150,0:06:02.830
dives start off with one which is going

0:06:00.550,0:06:05.440
to be the case for David just a reminder

0:06:02.830,0:06:07.510
every dive has a degree of difficulty or

0:06:05.440,0:06:10.030
a tariff it's three point six this and

0:06:07.510,0:06:14.110
that figure is multiplied by the sum of

0:06:10.030,0:06:16.120
the three middle scores they get now the

0:06:14.110,0:06:18.190
diving pool can settle down and await

0:06:16.120,0:06:20.920
the start of competition we David Boudia

0:06:18.190,0:06:23.560
from the United States twenty-three year

0:06:20.920,0:06:25.570
old from Abilene in Texas getting us

0:06:23.560,0:06:27.940
under way with an arm stand back double

0:06:25.570,0:06:31.680
somersault two and a half twists which

0:06:27.940,0:06:31.680
is a strong opening dive

0:06:39.360,0:06:45.490
solid start from him and this was one of

0:06:42.880,0:06:48.520
his better dives last night at hauled in

0:06:45.490,0:06:52.360
81 points and with the higher tariffs

0:06:48.520,0:06:56.290
dives decent execution is going to get

0:06:52.360,0:06:58.690
you a healthy score and start as you

0:06:56.290,0:07:03.910
intend to finish well this is very

0:06:58.690,0:07:07.510
promising for David minimal splash good

0:07:03.910,0:07:10.000
angle of entry and an 88 point - so

0:07:07.510,0:07:15.180
straight off he's improved on his

0:07:10.000,0:07:24.040
beginning from last night next up is

0:07:15.180,0:07:26.950
Jose equator of Cuba forward three and a

0:07:24.040,0:07:29.530
half somersault hiked for weather who

0:07:26.950,0:07:31.660
like quite a few of these divers also

0:07:29.530,0:07:34.690
competed in the 10 metre synchro event

0:07:31.660,0:07:36.370
where he finished in fifth position much

0:07:34.690,0:07:38.170
lower tariffs on this dive which he's

0:07:36.370,0:07:39.490
executed well he's going to get eight

0:07:38.170,0:07:47.380
and eight in the house but he won't

0:07:39.490,0:07:48.880
score as highly as David Boudia somewhat

0:07:47.380,0:07:53.440
mucked up his first dive last night it

0:07:48.880,0:07:55.870
was this one the only had 58.5 so 76.5

0:07:53.440,0:07:57.850
well there's an improvement as well and

0:07:55.870,0:08:00.100
a significant one by some 18 points

0:07:57.850,0:08:02.170
that's huge so he's on his way

0:08:00.100,0:08:04.210
momentum and confidence so important to

0:08:02.170,0:08:07.180
these divers through the competition now

0:08:04.210,0:08:09.880
this is glib galperin who had a storming

0:08:07.180,0:08:12.070
start he's 27 years of age very

0:08:09.880,0:08:16.120
experienced but had a horrendous amount

0:08:12.070,0:08:18.490
of injury and again he started well he's

0:08:16.120,0:08:20.980
controlled that entry beautifully and

0:08:18.490,0:08:22.660
just flattened the water pulled the air

0:08:20.980,0:08:26.200
down with him and he opened with an 88

0:08:22.660,0:08:28.840
yesterday and he's the one who has to

0:08:26.200,0:08:34.780
deal with the upcoming up applause and

0:08:28.840,0:08:36.610
performance of Tom Daley but eight and a

0:08:34.780,0:08:39.559
half's across the board pretty much from

0:08:36.610,0:08:41.479
the judges and an 81 point six

0:08:39.559,0:08:43.769
[Applause]

0:08:41.479,0:08:47.850
right for the moment the crowd realized

0:08:43.769,0:08:50.850
that next up is Tom Daley control degree

0:08:47.850,0:08:53.100
of bedlam breaks out I think that

0:08:50.850,0:08:58.110
reflects the anxiety everybody feels for

0:08:53.100,0:09:00.060
this young teenaged superstar second

0:08:58.110,0:09:03.720
Olympics competing when he was just 14

0:09:00.060,0:09:05.939
in Beijing my camera angle that is Tom

0:09:03.720,0:09:14.759
Daley back two and a half somersault two

0:09:05.939,0:09:17.129
and a half twist well it was a good

0:09:14.759,0:09:20.279
entry buddy on our angle we could see

0:09:17.129,0:09:24.269
that he wasn't quite square to the side

0:09:20.279,0:09:27.509
of the pool and that leg angle may well

0:09:24.269,0:09:28.920
have been caught by the judges very

0:09:27.509,0:09:33.990
difficult with this amount of twisting

0:09:28.920,0:09:36.209
to line yourself up properly and he has

0:09:33.990,0:09:38.420
been marked down a little for that he

0:09:36.209,0:09:41.420
opened with a seventy three point eight

0:09:38.420,0:09:41.420
yesterday

0:09:45.420,0:09:50.470
so it's just slightly twisted to the

0:09:47.740,0:09:53.770
angle he desired and an 81 though so he

0:09:50.470,0:09:54.480
too has found some improvement when it

0:09:53.770,0:09:57.310
matters

0:09:54.480,0:09:59.290
PA announcer asking the very

0:09:57.310,0:10:01.540
enthusiastic crowd here to refrain from

0:09:59.290,0:10:07.090
taking flash photographs not wanting to

0:10:01.540,0:10:11.800
distract the divers at all Victor mini

0:10:07.090,0:10:14.200
buyer from Russia opening divers in him

0:10:11.800,0:10:18.480
with three and a half somersault tucked

0:10:14.200,0:10:18.480
just 3.2 the tariff here

0:10:27.920,0:10:31.660
long hold at the top here

0:10:38.050,0:10:43.460
well he does a good job in the end we

0:10:40.370,0:10:44.870
always get to a little concern when they

0:10:43.460,0:10:47.450
spend that much time at the top that's

0:10:44.870,0:10:51.380
we've discussed it's like not being able

0:10:47.450,0:10:53.750
to put the powder on the ball in golf

0:10:51.380,0:10:55.190
it's almost the yips but it's a slightly

0:10:53.750,0:10:56.720
dangerous dive as they come in closer

0:10:55.190,0:10:58.670
with their head as you can see but he

0:10:56.720,0:11:01.310
had more margin for error than perhaps

0:10:58.670,0:11:04.790
that camera angle suggested only sevens

0:11:01.310,0:11:06.110
yesterday for that dive so he - so this

0:11:04.790,0:11:07.880
is a great start to the competition

0:11:06.110,0:11:08.540
Roger they're all lifting their

0:11:07.880,0:11:11.000
performance

0:11:08.540,0:11:15.280
it's Victor's first Olympic Games he's a

0:11:11.000,0:11:19.130
European silver medalist on the platform

0:11:15.280,0:11:20.720
moving on now to Victor Ortega or their

0:11:19.130,0:11:23.360
back to the half somersault one and a

0:11:20.720,0:11:29.450
half twists twenty-four-year-old from

0:11:23.360,0:11:33.200
Colombia and there is the first sort of

0:11:29.450,0:11:40.130
significant error on entry coming from

0:11:33.200,0:11:42.880
Victor or Tiger 75.2 for this opening

0:11:40.130,0:11:42.880
dive yesterday

0:11:43.510,0:11:48.280
but it'll be a lower return today a

0:11:49.060,0:11:58.730
slightly messy entry all good to this

0:11:56.900,0:12:00.230
point and then just miss times the

0:11:58.730,0:12:01.730
kick-out and the feet were slightly

0:12:00.230,0:12:03.860
apart of sight on the judges aren't

0:12:01.730,0:12:06.290
going to see that so much but sixty

0:12:03.860,0:12:08.870
eight point eight so he's given up about

0:12:06.290,0:12:13.640
seven marks on that opening diaphragm

0:12:08.870,0:12:15.500
yesterday ukraine's anton zakharov 26

0:12:13.640,0:12:17.920
years of age has been competing at the

0:12:15.500,0:12:20.570
highest level for more than a decade

0:12:17.920,0:12:23.420
first World Championships worth back in

0:12:20.570,0:12:30.500
2001 inward through the half somersault

0:12:23.420,0:12:32.780
tucked that was beautifully done and you

0:12:30.500,0:12:35.330
just caught a hint of that gas with the

0:12:32.780,0:12:36.770
crowd doesn't like to see their head and

0:12:35.330,0:12:39.020
body go that class at the end of the

0:12:36.770,0:12:45.200
platform but uh Anton knew what he was

0:12:39.020,0:12:48.440
doing well that is close this is going

0:12:45.200,0:12:53.860
to be higher than yesterday and a 72 for

0:12:48.440,0:12:58.340
his first dive how close that close I

0:12:53.860,0:13:01.400
don't know 20 centimeters a lot of good

0:12:58.340,0:13:03.110
height up off that platform to give

0:13:01.400,0:13:06.200
himself the the room and time to get

0:13:03.110,0:13:08.210
through the somersaults before he can

0:13:06.200,0:13:09.950
straighten out to make the perfect to

0:13:08.210,0:13:13.190
entry or it's near perfect if he can

0:13:09.950,0:13:16.090
make it seventy six point eight healthy

0:13:13.190,0:13:20.200
start as we move on to Riley McCormack

0:13:16.090,0:13:22.280
the Canadian who's 21 later this month

0:13:20.200,0:13:29.510
for with three and a half somersault

0:13:22.280,0:13:31.180
height to get off underway well it was

0:13:29.510,0:13:34.210
all right he had a little bit too much

0:13:31.180,0:13:39.650
forward momentum out into the pool to

0:13:34.210,0:13:41.480
create the vertical entry but there's a

0:13:39.650,0:13:48.800
lot of some ourselves to get through

0:13:41.480,0:13:53.030
here took it very close to the platform

0:13:48.800,0:13:58.580
before throwing himself out into the

0:13:53.030,0:14:00.140
into the ether there 72 to see him get

0:13:58.580,0:14:02.240
more than that he a number of these

0:14:00.140,0:14:05.590
competitors who have made the last 18

0:14:02.240,0:14:10.040
did not start well McCormick was won and

0:14:05.590,0:14:11.690
agreed it was another ranked leg wheeler

0:14:10.040,0:14:19.930
from Cuba forward three-and-a-half

0:14:11.690,0:14:23.870
somersault to open he got to the

0:14:19.930,0:14:26.600
semi-final in Beijing four years ago so

0:14:23.870,0:14:29.600
his ambition at least will be to go one

0:14:26.600,0:14:32.570
step further and make the top 12 after

0:14:29.600,0:14:35.170
the small wings competition better first

0:14:32.570,0:14:42.530
dive it's only got a low tariff of 3

0:14:35.170,0:14:44.060
yesterday only 61 and a half we had an

0:14:42.530,0:14:50.410
interesting angle for himself they're

0:14:44.060,0:14:53.510
coming from that side of the platform 72

0:14:50.410,0:14:55.600
big cheer goes up for the defending

0:14:53.510,0:14:59.600
Olympic champion who had a patchy night

0:14:55.600,0:15:05.180
Matthew Mitchum from Australia of the

0:14:59.600,0:15:07.850
big names of the platform we never knew

0:15:05.180,0:15:11.089
quite what to expect from mr. Mitchum

0:15:07.850,0:15:12.589
Eminem last night but he's got the big

0:15:11.089,0:15:15.350
one in his lock always capable of

0:15:12.589,0:15:17.540
pulling out something spectacular if his

0:15:15.350,0:15:19.370
somewhat injured body allows it he

0:15:17.540,0:15:21.200
admits that he can't put in as much

0:15:19.370,0:15:28.070
difficulty as he would like because he's

0:15:21.200,0:15:31.940
got some limitations now his dive itself

0:15:28.070,0:15:34.250
just tariffs of three he's all good

0:15:31.940,0:15:42.920
scores for it and there's opening 75

0:15:34.250,0:15:45.470
just under what he did last night update

0:15:42.920,0:15:48.380
there on the standings to date but it's

0:15:45.470,0:15:50.690
a little bit misleading because the top

0:15:48.380,0:15:52.240
guys are still to go towards the end of

0:15:50.690,0:15:56.540
the round

0:15:52.240,0:16:01.000
Nick McCrory from the United States 21

0:15:56.540,0:16:01.000
year old he got a bronze in the synchro

0:16:01.480,0:16:05.860
in with three and a half somersault

0:16:06.040,0:16:13.040
nicely finished well through and

0:16:10.010,0:16:16.449
somersaults to spot the water get the

0:16:13.040,0:16:16.449
entry just right

0:16:16.710,0:16:23.140
into a tight tuck knees up to the

0:16:19.750,0:16:29.580
shoulders and control the entry pretty

0:16:23.140,0:16:29.580
well see better ripped entries than this

0:16:32.910,0:16:41.920
straight eighths to count their seventy

0:16:35.770,0:16:44.890
six point eight zero alexander bond are

0:16:41.920,0:16:47.260
now from ukraine another one of the

0:16:44.890,0:16:49.480
impressive number of teenagers in this

0:16:47.260,0:16:53.040
competition just eighteen in would three

0:16:49.480,0:16:53.040
and a half somersault tucked

0:17:02.690,0:17:09.350
Oh excellent starts he had five very

0:17:07.490,0:17:11.329
good dives last night and one terrible

0:17:09.350,0:17:14.929
one his third to keep an eye on that one

0:17:11.329,0:17:17.480
is caught under 60 but he's commenced

0:17:14.929,0:17:19.130
well again here all the power going

0:17:17.480,0:17:23.569
through the toes on the end of the

0:17:19.130,0:17:25.069
platform and quickly through the

0:17:23.569,0:17:30.289
somersaults to give him plenty of time

0:17:25.069,0:17:32.000
to find a good entry you can have a

0:17:30.289,0:17:34.820
great synchro competition finished

0:17:32.000,0:17:38.600
eighth with solid sander gawrsh covers

0:17:34.820,0:17:39.799
off after finishing third in the timmy

0:17:38.600,0:17:43.580
de synchro in last year's World

0:17:39.799,0:17:45.950
Championship so he's got a little bit

0:17:43.580,0:17:47.809
more to come out still now the Mexican

0:17:45.950,0:17:50.510
divers are having a good games and a

0:17:47.809,0:17:53.870
good competition at 10 meters as well

0:17:50.510,0:17:55.780
this is even Garcia forward four and a

0:17:53.870,0:18:01.730
half somersault with a three point seven

0:17:55.780,0:18:03.409
difficulty and ambitious opening it's

0:18:01.730,0:18:06.530
done a nice job of it we're into the top

0:18:03.409,0:18:08.900
six now and we've got two competitors

0:18:06.530,0:18:11.390
from three nations Mexico Mexico in

0:18:08.900,0:18:14.650
Germany Germany and then the top seeded

0:18:11.390,0:18:14.650
two Chinese

0:18:17.840,0:18:25.190
not to get through here and that's a

0:18:22.460,0:18:28.010
great position he finds his he enters

0:18:25.190,0:18:31.100
and keeps the splash to a minimum so

0:18:28.010,0:18:32.900
he's gone very respectable scores there

0:18:31.100,0:18:37.640
in an eighty eight point eight to open

0:18:32.900,0:18:42.050
with Garcia has a silver medal from the

0:18:37.640,0:18:44.930
ten metre synchro with his countryman

0:18:42.050,0:18:47.950
German Sanchez who's now on the board

0:18:44.930,0:18:50.710
for a back three-and-a-half somersault

0:18:47.950,0:18:53.090
so these two divers have already

0:18:50.710,0:18:55.430
performed impressively and are still

0:18:53.090,0:18:59.590
going strong this was the top scoring

0:18:55.430,0:18:59.590
dive in the first round last night

0:19:05.990,0:19:15.899
or what it might well be again an 89.1

0:19:12.200,0:19:21.659
last night for German Sanchez with nines

0:19:15.899,0:19:26.880
across the board he has absolutely

0:19:21.659,0:19:29.039
controlled this he's in the flyweight

0:19:26.880,0:19:31.799
division seven stones six pounds that's

0:19:29.039,0:19:35.850
forty seven kilos his body weight which

0:19:31.799,0:19:38.700
is extremely light judge is not feeling

0:19:35.850,0:19:43.049
quite as generous as in the prelims and

0:19:38.700,0:19:44.669
an eighty five point eight as opposed to

0:19:43.049,0:19:51.299
he's eighty nine from last night but

0:19:44.669,0:19:54.149
pretty close as the standard rises in

0:19:51.299,0:19:56.970
this competition inevitably the counties

0:19:54.149,0:19:58.769
will be a little bit more push to be a

0:19:56.970,0:20:00.029
little bit more stingy with their

0:19:58.769,0:20:01.139
marking like that they really gonna have

0:20:00.029,0:20:02.370
to work for it but we've not been

0:20:01.139,0:20:04.260
dazzled by tens

0:20:02.370,0:20:06.120
I'm sure that's still to come possibly

0:20:04.260,0:20:09.779
tonight when their competition really

0:20:06.120,0:20:13.529
hots up Martin Wolfram now who's had a

0:20:09.779,0:20:15.299
very good competition to date I'm stand

0:20:13.529,0:20:21.419
back double somersault two and a half

0:20:15.299,0:20:23.250
twists a pretty good effort he's the

0:20:21.419,0:20:27.720
12th ranked dive in the first round last

0:20:23.250,0:20:31.830
night seventy seven point four observed

0:20:27.720,0:20:35.250
as we did that the splash was a bit more

0:20:31.830,0:20:39.200
than he would have liked maybe just a

0:20:35.250,0:20:39.200
little bit short of vertical on entry

0:20:39.649,0:20:46.490
and the ninety one point eight though

0:20:42.559,0:20:46.490
well judges did like it

0:20:46.580,0:20:54.860
lifting the top spot for the moment very

0:20:49.529,0:20:59.460
early days his countrymen Sascha Klein

0:20:54.860,0:21:04.940
dives next 26 year old in with three and

0:20:59.460,0:21:04.940
a half somersault tucked 3.2 the tariff

0:21:10.909,0:21:20.850
silver medalist in Beijing and the 10

0:21:13.919,0:21:26.970
metre synchro again nice and tied into

0:21:20.850,0:21:28.830
the end of the platform there's not

0:21:26.970,0:21:31.440
plenty of experience I think compared to

0:21:28.830,0:21:33.480
his country one fall from who's only 20

0:21:31.440,0:21:35.929
and experience is gonna count

0:21:33.480,0:21:39.049
increasingly as they go through these

0:21:35.929,0:21:44.039
rounds trying to keep that consistency

0:21:39.049,0:21:45.809
seventy six point eight about five marks

0:21:44.039,0:21:51.000
on his opening dive from the prelims and

0:21:45.809,0:21:55.169
now top two men class apart really Lin

0:21:51.000,0:22:03.120
you a 21 year old from Guangdong in with

0:21:55.169,0:22:07.379
three and a half somersault solid he

0:22:03.120,0:22:09.809
will improve is his second dive that

0:22:07.379,0:22:11.129
brought him and done last night let me

0:22:09.809,0:22:14.850
sand down he finished second but it

0:22:11.129,0:22:19.230
would he ended up with the 17th ranked

0:22:14.850,0:22:23.779
diver in the second series he had

0:22:19.230,0:22:23.779
several nines with his opening dive

0:22:23.929,0:22:31.250
yesterday but not quite so high here and

0:22:28.169,0:22:31.250
an 81 6

0:22:36.139,0:22:42.499
now the man who's been setting the

0:22:38.369,0:22:45.419
standards chuubo nineteen years of age

0:22:42.499,0:22:49.100
the favorite for the gold in wood three

0:22:45.419,0:22:49.100
and a half somersault tucked

0:22:56.559,0:23:01.039
well he was there so early he gets

0:22:59.450,0:23:04.239
through the somersaults in the blink of

0:23:01.039,0:23:06.440
an eye and he seems to have so much time

0:23:04.239,0:23:08.570
to get the entry right which of course

0:23:06.440,0:23:11.629
he's done this is his lowest tariff dive

0:23:08.570,0:23:13.489
and it was his lowest scoring dive last

0:23:11.629,0:23:15.799
night it just says he doesn't even

0:23:13.489,0:23:20.989
particularly like this dive but he's

0:23:15.799,0:23:22.340
kidding 9 to 9 and a half he must be the

0:23:20.989,0:23:24.379
only person in the pool that doesn't

0:23:22.340,0:23:27.859
like it everybody else could only admire

0:23:24.379,0:23:29.899
it and absolutely impassive through

0:23:27.859,0:23:31.999
competition isn't he eighty nine point

0:23:29.899,0:23:35.239
six he's found an extra three marks

0:23:31.999,0:23:41.359
there and that completes the first

0:23:35.239,0:23:42.830
series 12 the cutoff point remember

0:23:41.359,0:23:45.289
Martin for France

0:23:42.830,0:23:47.869
it's his first Olympic Games it's really

0:23:45.289,0:23:53.919
untested at this level and he's

0:23:47.869,0:23:53.919
performing superbly chuubo Ivan Garcia

0:23:54.309,0:24:01.820
Mexican boys will place their third and

0:23:56.749,0:24:04.759
fifth Sascha Klein more to come from him

0:24:01.820,0:24:07.190
and three divers they're linked on 11th

0:24:04.759,0:24:09.919
if they were level on points at the end

0:24:07.190,0:24:12.289
of six dives then they would all go

0:24:09.919,0:24:14.539
through there's no count back I think

0:24:12.289,0:24:16.489
I've added diving that they they would

0:24:14.539,0:24:22.249
share qualification and if it comes to

0:24:16.489,0:24:24.019
tonight the chair of medal as well just

0:24:22.249,0:24:26.450
a little surprising to see Sasha climb

0:24:24.019,0:24:34.179
down the list there he was never out of

0:24:26.450,0:24:36.859
the top five in the prelim David Boudia

0:24:34.179,0:24:40.929
I'm studying communications at Purdue

0:24:36.859,0:24:43.100
University Western Lafayette in Indiana

0:24:40.929,0:24:45.639
second dive in with three-and-a-half

0:24:43.100,0:24:45.639
somersault

0:24:49.530,0:24:57.670
nicely handled again from David this

0:24:56.080,0:24:58.980
wasn't one of his better dives last

0:24:57.670,0:25:04.210
night

0:24:58.980,0:25:05.740
mr. yielding seventy three point six all

0:25:04.210,0:25:07.900
but the judges like what they've seen

0:25:05.740,0:25:12.130
here they're very impressive entry and

0:25:07.900,0:25:15.100
very quickly through his somersaults

0:25:12.130,0:25:19.840
nice leg form and an eighty six point

0:25:15.100,0:25:22.150
four he's come to compete now he was a

0:25:19.840,0:25:25.060
bit rusty last night so we knew that

0:25:22.150,0:25:29.770
18th was no reflection of David's

0:25:25.060,0:25:33.010
potential who's a dweller from Cuba now

0:25:29.770,0:25:37.800
back three and a half Sava salt and

0:25:33.010,0:25:37.800
again massively improved on last night

0:25:43.980,0:25:47.740
well that died for him last night was

0:25:46.180,0:25:50.980
nothing short of a disaster he got

0:25:47.740,0:25:53.440
twenty one point six it was barely a

0:25:50.980,0:25:56.650
dive at all it's crashed into the water

0:25:53.440,0:25:59.590
well short and you'll be relieved to

0:25:56.650,0:26:04.900
have got it out of the way and with the

0:25:59.590,0:26:09.610
eights being announced he's the senior

0:26:04.900,0:26:13.410
Pro on duty today he's 33 years of age

0:26:09.610,0:26:17.440
the oldest competitor in the pool today

0:26:13.410,0:26:21.550
so 88.2 compared to twenty one point six

0:26:17.440,0:26:26.110
and that is a massive improvement and

0:26:21.550,0:26:30.640
maybe he is heading for the final will

0:26:26.110,0:26:33.040
be glib Cowper ins aim had eight

0:26:30.640,0:26:35.010
operations on back and knee problems and

0:26:33.040,0:26:37.600
missed a couple of years through injury

0:26:35.010,0:26:40.140
this is an arm stand reverse triple

0:26:37.600,0:26:40.140
somersault

0:26:41.390,0:26:51.670
or dear well short and that was a dive

0:26:46.309,0:26:54.140
that got in ninety 1.8 in the prelims

0:26:51.670,0:26:59.179
never looked in control really the arm

0:26:54.140,0:27:05.840
stander and the legs far from vertical

0:26:59.179,0:27:08.299
left so that's a potentially eliminating

0:27:05.840,0:27:11.420
him 37.4 depends what the others do and

0:27:08.299,0:27:12.460
if he can now a few big dives but now

0:27:11.420,0:27:15.679
Tom Daley

0:27:12.460,0:27:18.559
he was Britain's youngest team member at

0:27:15.679,0:27:21.260
just 14 years of age four years ago in

0:27:18.559,0:27:23.900
Beijing he's had some four years to

0:27:21.260,0:27:27.140
contend with since in with three and a

0:27:23.900,0:27:29.290
half somersault tucked for the 18 year

0:27:27.140,0:27:29.290
old

0:27:38.929,0:27:43.260
that's a super entry and the crowd

0:27:41.370,0:27:45.090
recognizes that and they're going to

0:27:43.260,0:27:51.900
work on the judges now to get their man

0:27:45.090,0:27:53.610
a big score fantastic reception every

0:27:51.900,0:27:56.130
mum in that crowd wishes their daughter

0:27:53.610,0:27:59.910
would bring Tom home for tea and it's

0:27:56.130,0:28:02.299
just got that sort of look he does and

0:27:59.910,0:28:04.380
he's absolutely mastered this dive

0:28:02.299,0:28:07.650
keeping it in tight to the end of the

0:28:04.380,0:28:09.360
platform he was operating on minimal

0:28:07.650,0:28:11.370
sleep he wanted to be here early getting

0:28:09.360,0:28:13.340
lots of practice before this session he

0:28:11.370,0:28:16.799
was quite disappointed in himself and in

0:28:13.340,0:28:21.390
86.4 he's found another eight marks on

0:28:16.799,0:28:27.870
that dive alone Victor mini bive from

0:28:21.390,0:28:30.030
Russia forward four and a half

0:28:27.870,0:28:33.090
somersault three point seven the tariff

0:28:30.030,0:28:35.909
here and you can expect victor to attack

0:28:33.090,0:28:38.280
this dive all the way one of the quite

0:28:35.909,0:28:43.700
physical Eastern European more powerful

0:28:38.280,0:28:46.350
looking divers good job

0:28:43.700,0:28:51.539
it was his top scoring guide last night

0:28:46.350,0:28:56.340
he wants it in the 80s again eighty six

0:28:51.539,0:29:00.659
point nine five that's what it brought

0:28:56.340,0:29:03.860
him at the first attempt just slightly

0:29:00.659,0:29:03.860
past the vertical

0:29:08.580,0:29:15.040
couple of eights and seven and a half's

0:29:10.690,0:29:16.390
in there eighty six nine five that's

0:29:15.040,0:29:20.070
exactly what he had last night

0:29:16.390,0:29:23.080
there you go you talk about consistency

0:29:20.070,0:29:24.429
victor ortega from colombia now straight

0:29:23.080,0:29:27.400
into his forward three and a half

0:29:24.429,0:29:28.900
somersault some of them really as soon

0:29:27.400,0:29:29.760
as they get the call they want to go

0:29:28.900,0:29:32.080
don't they

0:29:29.760,0:29:34.840
this is a bit disappointing for a tiger

0:29:32.080,0:29:36.010
it's a low tariff dive his lowest in

0:29:34.840,0:29:39.580
fact 3.0

0:29:36.010,0:29:41.950
and he's not done such a great job in a

0:29:39.580,0:29:46.049
lovely pike position just rolled the

0:29:41.950,0:29:46.049
feet over and created a big splash but

0:29:48.690,0:29:55.990
nose to knees very flexible beautiful

0:29:53.440,0:30:02.470
position through the air just didn't

0:29:55.990,0:30:07.710
quite finish it off and the sixty three

0:30:02.470,0:30:14.049
only well the low tariff hurts that dive

0:30:07.710,0:30:16.480
and on zakharov from ukraine World

0:30:14.049,0:30:19.690
Championships silver and bronze in the

0:30:16.480,0:30:22.679
past at the synchro events back three

0:30:19.690,0:30:22.679
and a half somersault now

0:30:22.850,0:30:27.590
very good look it he wasn't quite

0:30:24.920,0:30:29.900
vertical but somehow he controlled the

0:30:27.590,0:30:31.310
entry and the better divers can do this

0:30:29.900,0:30:33.950
you think they're in trouble when they

0:30:31.310,0:30:34.550
hit the water but they pull the air down

0:30:33.950,0:30:37.730
with them

0:30:34.550,0:30:39.980
and it minimizes the splash his angle

0:30:37.730,0:30:41.420
was slightly off too but I only catch

0:30:39.980,0:30:43.430
that on the second look Roger this is

0:30:41.420,0:30:49.990
the judges just don't see everything

0:30:43.430,0:30:54.170
it's too quick he's got an 86 point for

0:30:49.990,0:30:56.210
nearly as good as last night's 88 - when

0:30:54.170,0:30:57.440
the hands come together as they prepare

0:30:56.210,0:30:59.120
for entry into the water they're not

0:30:57.440,0:31:00.410
just punching a hole through the water

0:30:59.120,0:31:04.300
they're punching a hole through the air

0:31:00.410,0:31:07.700
as well they're traveling at such speed

0:31:04.300,0:31:09.700
Raleigh McCormick now from Canada back

0:31:07.700,0:31:12.530
two and a half somersault two and a half

0:31:09.700,0:31:19.510
twist three point six the degree of

0:31:12.530,0:31:19.510
difficulty here sitting 11th

0:31:22.750,0:31:27.020
done a nice job they he looked a little

0:31:24.800,0:31:29.600
twitchy on the platform I wonder how

0:31:27.020,0:31:31.430
many little flexors of there of the

0:31:29.600,0:31:34.430
ankles they were going to be until he

0:31:31.430,0:31:40.640
went it got good power off the platform

0:31:34.430,0:31:42.590
his feet a little loose reasonable entry

0:31:40.640,0:31:44.210
and you should get a reasonable score

0:31:42.590,0:31:46.990
but you see the ankles drifting apart

0:31:44.210,0:31:49.160
there the judges don't want to see that

0:31:46.990,0:31:53.690
and you don't want them to see it if

0:31:49.160,0:31:59.270
you're on the driver but in 86 for but I

0:31:53.690,0:32:01.520
think they saw much of it a couple of

0:31:59.270,0:32:04.250
forum problems there but we can just

0:32:01.520,0:32:06.790
stress again that the judges just don't

0:32:04.250,0:32:11.410
catch what we can see on the slo-moes

0:32:06.790,0:32:16.670
they get one look Claire a grader from

0:32:11.410,0:32:19.940
Cuba down in 16th now has an inward

0:32:16.670,0:32:23.030
three and a half somersault tucked to

0:32:19.940,0:32:24.680
try to improve that oh my goodness he

0:32:23.030,0:32:26.690
was tied to the end of the platform that

0:32:24.680,0:32:29.540
gasp from the crowd as they worry about

0:32:26.690,0:32:32.150
contact this was his top scoring dive

0:32:29.540,0:32:35.330
last night he got nines a couple of nine

0:32:32.150,0:32:38.080
and a half's in fact well that's too

0:32:35.330,0:32:38.080
close for me

0:32:42.440,0:32:48.590
and these solid concrete up there not a

0:32:47.120,0:32:51.320
bad idea to have that towel there that

0:32:48.590,0:32:54.380
would at least help with the if there

0:32:51.320,0:32:58.010
was any contact but there's a disturbing

0:32:54.380,0:32:58.490
range here I don't like seeing six up to

0:32:58.010,0:33:00.620
eight

0:32:58.490,0:33:02.240
that's great despair that just tells you

0:33:00.620,0:33:06.590
that one judge saw something that others

0:33:02.240,0:33:08.470
didn't or thought they did after you

0:33:06.590,0:33:12.230
Mitch him now

0:33:08.470,0:33:15.350
Brisbane born lives in Sydney studying

0:33:12.230,0:33:18.020
language and science at Sydney

0:33:15.350,0:33:20.960
University back at three and a half

0:33:18.020,0:33:29.750
somersault for one of the big names in

0:33:20.960,0:33:32.450
diving oh that's an entry he looks in a

0:33:29.750,0:33:35.240
little better form he's it doesn't look

0:33:32.450,0:33:38.920
like a gold medalist but he's he's got

0:33:35.240,0:33:38.920
something going better than last night

0:33:41.470,0:33:48.170
well he's done again a good job with an

0:33:44.510,0:33:52.990
entry that wasn't vertical and an eighty

0:33:48.170,0:33:52.990
five point eight Matthew

0:33:53.240,0:34:03.539
trying to become only the fifth man to

0:33:55.740,0:34:05.100
retain ten meter Olympic title there'll

0:34:03.539,0:34:09.419
be a quiz question on the other four as

0:34:05.100,0:34:13.080
the competition unfolds I've got a piece

0:34:09.419,0:34:15.659
of paper here that tells me so we can we

0:34:13.080,0:34:18.510
could both look clever that's right Nick

0:34:15.659,0:34:20.490
McCrory now from the United States arm

0:34:18.510,0:34:21.270
stand back double somersault one and a

0:34:20.490,0:34:28.020
half twist

0:34:21.270,0:34:38.040
he's also links there in 11th place long

0:34:28.020,0:34:39.510
hold again he met him stared all right

0:34:38.040,0:34:42.389
there wasn't a lot of power off the

0:34:39.510,0:34:47.220
platform from the arm stand it was more

0:34:42.389,0:34:49.050
out into the pool and up but that was

0:34:47.220,0:34:51.599
how he executed the dive last night when

0:34:49.050,0:34:55.619
he left the platform the arms are pretty

0:34:51.599,0:34:58.020
straight but a lot of power coming here

0:34:55.619,0:34:59.520
at this moment some of that's generated

0:34:58.020,0:35:03.690
by their legs of course as they flick

0:34:59.520,0:35:06.180
out good position on entry judge looks

0:35:03.690,0:35:10.640
sorry coach looks satisfied if not

0:35:06.180,0:35:10.640
thrilled in eighty three point two

0:35:11.060,0:35:16.050
fractionally better than his first

0:35:12.780,0:35:19.820
attempt last night alexander banda from

0:35:16.050,0:35:22.290
the u quaint a crane 18 years of age

0:35:19.820,0:35:24.950
forward four and a half somersault three

0:35:22.290,0:35:24.950
point seven

0:35:26.480,0:35:34.609
a little messy at the finish you know

0:35:29.090,0:35:37.790
four and a half somersaults good tariffs

0:35:34.609,0:35:39.890
offered here 3.7 but getting it just

0:35:37.790,0:35:45.020
right that's what the divers have found

0:35:39.890,0:35:47.450
difficult with this one he was competing

0:35:45.020,0:35:50.690
at European Junior Championship level

0:35:47.450,0:35:52.580
just last year so it is a massive step

0:35:50.690,0:35:55.250
up for an 18 year old to suddenly find

0:35:52.580,0:36:02.030
himself diving against the absolute

0:35:55.250,0:36:07.850
cream 77 seven he's given up about six

0:36:02.030,0:36:11.680
points on the same dive last night first

0:36:07.850,0:36:15.500
of the two Mexican divers Evan Garcia

0:36:11.680,0:36:19.810
he's 18 years of age the younger of the

0:36:15.500,0:36:23.840
two back three and a half somersault

0:36:19.810,0:36:26.260
this was his best dive last night tucked

0:36:23.840,0:36:26.260
position

0:36:29.730,0:36:37.590
oh that's great you know the analogy

0:36:35.520,0:36:39.090
with the gymnastics for that kind of

0:36:37.590,0:36:41.790
dive is it's like a blind landing

0:36:39.090,0:36:44.130
because you're reaching back searching

0:36:41.790,0:36:47.580
for the water they spot the ceiling a

0:36:44.130,0:36:49.500
couple of times three times kick out get

0:36:47.580,0:36:51.060
themselves vertical that's what the

0:36:49.500,0:36:58.680
trainings all about being able to do

0:36:51.060,0:37:00.540
that these back somersaults now he kicks

0:36:58.680,0:37:06.810
out now he finds the vertical that's

0:37:00.540,0:37:10.560
really well done and an eighty seven

0:37:06.810,0:37:13.560
four five well done judges really like

0:37:10.560,0:37:18.090
that now it's his synchro silver metal

0:37:13.560,0:37:20.670
teammate German Sanchez his forward two

0:37:18.090,0:37:23.280
and a half somersault three twists the

0:37:20.670,0:37:24.930
piked position piked the legs are out

0:37:23.280,0:37:26.220
straighten the clutching around the back

0:37:24.930,0:37:29.390
of the knees are tucked when they're

0:37:26.220,0:37:29.390
curled up into a little ball

0:37:33.580,0:37:38.560
a lot to get through there was their

0:37:35.320,0:37:44.230
eyes and he got through it all but

0:37:38.560,0:37:47.200
compromising the entry I think seeing

0:37:44.230,0:37:49.120
how vertical he gets here and just

0:37:47.200,0:37:53.890
flipped the he was a little bend at the

0:37:49.120,0:37:55.360
hips in the end barely timing that for

0:37:53.890,0:37:57.220
the panic position to actually get into

0:37:55.360,0:38:02.520
it he's almost out of it as soon as he's

0:37:57.220,0:38:06.600
into it ninety one point two though that

0:38:02.520,0:38:06.600
decent tariff of three point eight

0:38:09.570,0:38:17.770
Martin Wolfram competing at the highest

0:38:13.930,0:38:19.750
level of his short career and responding

0:38:17.770,0:38:21.040
to the challenge leading after the first

0:38:19.750,0:38:28.300
round in with three and a half

0:38:21.040,0:38:32.740
somersaults well he didn't really get on

0:38:28.300,0:38:34.780
top of this dive last night and got a 72

0:38:32.740,0:38:38.610
for it it's his lowest terror of three

0:38:34.780,0:38:41.920
point two so if he can get more than 72

0:38:38.610,0:38:49.180
always going to the judges love this one

0:38:41.920,0:38:51.310
well his entry is near-perfect a more

0:38:49.180,0:38:53.620
straightforward dive you really do want

0:38:51.310,0:38:56.740
to be making the most of the entry and

0:38:53.620,0:38:59.410
that Martin's done that with an eighty

0:38:56.740,0:39:03.370
six point four and a low tariff dive

0:38:59.410,0:39:08.770
that's an excellent return very

0:39:03.370,0:39:12.820
impressive Olympic debut Sascha Klein

0:39:08.770,0:39:15.580
his older more experienced countrymen

0:39:12.820,0:39:18.800
eight gold and two silver at European

0:39:15.580,0:39:20.660
level forward for a half somersault

0:39:18.800,0:39:23.000
[Applause]

0:39:20.660,0:39:25.990
he's got some support here well they

0:39:23.000,0:39:32.270
both have Sasha Cline and Martin Wolfram

0:39:25.990,0:39:39.530
and why not this one team 88.8 last

0:39:32.270,0:39:47.390
night might be a very similar score high

0:39:39.530,0:39:50.960
eighties perhaps for Sasha well ninety

0:39:47.390,0:39:52.820
point six five even better it's a so

0:39:50.960,0:39:55.070
impressed Roger to see so many divers

0:39:52.820,0:40:00.170
just finding you know another three five

0:39:55.070,0:40:03.610
ten points then you a needs to do that

0:40:00.170,0:40:05.870
this was six after the first dive

0:40:03.610,0:40:08.390
reversed three-and-a-half somersault

0:40:05.870,0:40:10.430
there he's a man with high expectations

0:40:08.390,0:40:12.440
is his first time he's competed at the

0:40:10.430,0:40:15.070
very highest level in in an individual

0:40:12.440,0:40:17.390
event normally it's been synchro success

0:40:15.070,0:40:18.050
this was the dive that troubled him last

0:40:17.390,0:40:20.510
night

0:40:18.050,0:40:22.850
seventy four point two five last night

0:40:20.510,0:40:26.420
with seven and a half's but much better

0:40:22.850,0:40:31.610
effort here totally in control from the

0:40:26.420,0:40:35.030
moment he left the platform that is a

0:40:31.610,0:40:38.150
very small splash from ten meters and a

0:40:35.030,0:40:40.490
ninety four oh five three nine and a

0:40:38.150,0:40:42.290
half's count only one night I don't

0:40:40.490,0:40:48.230
think we've seen so many nine-halves in

0:40:42.290,0:40:51.620
a set of figures so far cube Oh a world

0:40:48.230,0:40:56.660
champion number one favorite for this

0:40:51.620,0:41:01.930
the 19 year old from Sichuan with a arm

0:40:56.660,0:41:01.930
stand back triple somersault worth 3.5

0:41:04.830,0:41:11.910
oh well there is a rare identifiable

0:41:09.210,0:41:17.010
mistake from chuubo this was a dive got

0:41:11.910,0:41:19.740
him 99.75 last night but he's a little

0:41:17.010,0:41:23.910
bit initially in the pike and short on

0:41:19.740,0:41:28.650
entry so he is human

0:41:23.910,0:41:30.240
yes he was in Rome in 2009 in the World

0:41:28.650,0:41:32.640
Championships it came down to the last

0:41:30.240,0:41:35.250
three dives with himself from Matthew

0:41:32.640,0:41:37.050
Mitchum and Tom Daley and chuubo didn't

0:41:35.250,0:41:38.940
produce the dive on the day and nor did

0:41:37.050,0:41:42.720
Matthew Mitchum and that was when Tom

0:41:38.940,0:41:44.810
Daley stole the title so maybe at just

0:41:42.720,0:41:47.610
that little seed of doubt knows that

0:41:44.810,0:41:51.660
he's very aware that things can go wrong

0:41:47.610,0:41:53.160
but Martin Wolfram is really storming in

0:41:51.660,0:41:55.320
this semi-final it is just the

0:41:53.160,0:41:57.420
semi-final the Mexicans again in those

0:41:55.320,0:42:00.120
two Chinese divers in fourth and fifth

0:41:57.420,0:42:03.240
that's not their sort of natural dye

0:42:00.120,0:42:04.830
being habitat Tom Daley night Fair

0:42:03.240,0:42:07.530
Sascha Klein has dropped a little bit

0:42:04.830,0:42:10.170
David Boudia now starting to emerge in

0:42:07.530,0:42:13.350
12th Matthew Mitchum is where the cutoff

0:42:10.170,0:42:16.580
is but he's only 0.8 ahead of Nick

0:42:13.350,0:42:19.860
McCrory Rowley McCormick so there's

0:42:16.580,0:42:21.960
plenty more that can happen and gleb

0:42:19.860,0:42:23.610
galperin down at the bottom they're

0:42:21.960,0:42:26.580
holding up the rest at the moment for

0:42:23.610,0:42:29.420
the two Chinese divers just being given

0:42:26.580,0:42:29.420
something to think about

0:42:32.630,0:42:37.769
and satisfy themselves in the knowledge

0:42:35.430,0:42:39.660
that the scores don't carry forward to

0:42:37.769,0:42:42.599
the phone I just have to make the 12 and

0:42:39.660,0:42:44.609
then start again start afresh and

0:42:42.599,0:42:47.180
through one or two dives that didn't

0:42:44.609,0:42:49.680
please you you have to worry about them

0:42:47.180,0:42:52.529
there is that advantage perhaps if you

0:42:49.680,0:42:54.930
do dive last you do know at least what

0:42:52.529,0:42:56.999
you've got to do you also know of course

0:42:54.930,0:43:01.229
that there's nobody else who can make a

0:42:56.999,0:43:05.369
mistake so it is all down to you David

0:43:01.229,0:43:09.079
Boudia kicks us off having a much much

0:43:05.369,0:43:11.339
better series of dives so far this

0:43:09.079,0:43:18.029
forward four and a half somersault

0:43:11.339,0:43:20.400
tucked is worth three point seven very

0:43:18.029,0:43:22.160
tidy he's top scoring dive in the

0:43:20.400,0:43:24.390
prelims with an eighty eight point eight

0:43:22.160,0:43:25.799
it's a bit of a rush to reach the

0:43:24.390,0:43:28.069
vertical with this dive because there's

0:43:25.799,0:43:31.910
so many somersaults to get through just

0:43:28.069,0:43:31.910
powers off the end of the platform

0:43:33.049,0:43:37.890
in fact he almost over rotated it didn't

0:43:35.910,0:43:40.200
he but to control the entry once more

0:43:37.890,0:43:43.019
he's having a much better session here

0:43:40.200,0:43:44.759
second time around remember this is the

0:43:43.019,0:43:48.630
guy who does confess that he has a bit

0:43:44.759,0:43:50.849
of a fear of heights which is a strange

0:43:48.630,0:43:52.680
complaint when you want to be a 10 metre

0:43:50.849,0:43:54.690
platform diver that that's a new high

0:43:52.680,0:43:58.829
mark for him into the nineties he didn't

0:43:54.690,0:44:05.339
manage that last night so he's come to

0:43:58.829,0:44:06.869
compete go see Greta from Cuba down in

0:44:05.339,0:44:09.989
10th position in with three and a half

0:44:06.869,0:44:14.099
somersault three point two so he can't

0:44:09.989,0:44:15.800
afford to get too much wrong here well

0:44:14.099,0:44:19.780
we got it all right

0:44:15.800,0:44:19.780
[Applause]

0:44:22.250,0:44:31.890
and again oh that's close isn't it you

0:44:29.640,0:44:34.230
take out his disastrous second dive in

0:44:31.890,0:44:35.610
the prelims without 21.6 that we

0:44:34.230,0:44:37.740
preferred to a couple of times

0:44:35.610,0:44:42.980
how much further up the rankings would

0:44:37.740,0:44:42.980
he have been give him another 50 points

0:44:43.280,0:44:52.440
he's good dives coming Gleb galperin

0:44:48.750,0:44:55.380
the 27 year old from Moscow double world

0:44:52.440,0:44:58.490
champion double Olympic bronze he's the

0:44:55.380,0:45:00.720
man remember who's had al injury worries

0:44:58.490,0:45:07.160
forward three and a half somersault

0:45:00.720,0:45:09.660
there just a 3.0 degree of difficulty

0:45:07.160,0:45:13.080
the girlfriend had some problems with

0:45:09.660,0:45:15.320
his second dive low tariffs here he's

0:45:13.080,0:45:22.410
gonna have to fight back with his last

0:45:15.320,0:45:27.170
three good scores but only a three

0:45:22.410,0:45:27.170
tariff so 72

0:45:28.599,0:45:33.859
you'll know what's coming next with

0:45:32.299,0:45:35.690
Peter Waterfield having a really

0:45:33.859,0:45:38.509
disappointing evening last night Tom

0:45:35.690,0:45:41.299
Daly is carrying British hopes entirely

0:45:38.509,0:45:47.930
on his young shoulders arm stand back

0:45:41.299,0:45:52.099
triple somersault 3.5 no towel for extra

0:45:47.930,0:45:57.319
grip for four Tom see how long he holds

0:45:52.099,0:46:09.140
the dive right at the top this was Tom's

0:45:57.319,0:46:11.029
top scoring dive in prelims than 89 very

0:46:09.140,0:46:17.089
impressive on the platform look so in

0:46:11.029,0:46:20.029
control good push just not quite 100%

0:46:17.089,0:46:25.309
vertical with the entry but the judges

0:46:20.029,0:46:26.420
are gonna like most of this crowd trying

0:46:25.309,0:46:28.130
to put a little bit of pressure on the

0:46:26.420,0:46:32.480
judges to maybe convince them that it

0:46:28.130,0:46:35.180
was slightly better than it was so he's

0:46:32.480,0:46:37.730
not 100% vertical and he's not 100%

0:46:35.180,0:46:44.420
square either but it's a very good dive

0:46:37.730,0:46:48.769
in every other aspect great line toes

0:46:44.420,0:46:51.920
pointed and fingers to toes and an 84

0:46:48.769,0:46:55.970
they're just a 5-point short of last

0:46:51.920,0:46:57.769
night's effort Victor mini vibe from

0:46:55.970,0:47:03.140
Russia reverse three and a half

0:46:57.769,0:47:06.160
somersault tucked experiencing any big

0:47:03.140,0:47:06.160
aims for the first time

0:47:09.540,0:47:17.350
very composed waiting and he's got his

0:47:13.420,0:47:21.090
mind completely right and clear the

0:47:17.350,0:47:21.090
visualization may be going on there

0:47:22.380,0:47:29.380
jump well away from the platform if that

0:47:25.720,0:47:34.210
didn't compromise the somersaults or his

0:47:29.380,0:47:36.070
entry position this dive too from that

0:47:34.210,0:47:38.890
standing position close to the platform

0:47:36.070,0:47:41.560
you you can't have a worry but took that

0:47:38.890,0:47:44.740
out of the equation and abide by taking

0:47:41.560,0:47:51.190
himself well away lots of clearance room

0:47:44.740,0:47:53.980
there compromise those if you jump out

0:47:51.190,0:47:56.020
rather than up you'll find yourself

0:47:53.980,0:48:01.060
short of time not that seventy nine

0:47:56.020,0:48:06.670
point two is very solid Columbia is

0:48:01.060,0:48:10.390
Victor Ortega who was taken diving when

0:48:06.670,0:48:13.930
he was just three years of age he's back

0:48:10.390,0:48:16.870
in 17th position so this arm stand back

0:48:13.930,0:48:21.090
triple somersault three point three

0:48:16.870,0:48:21.090
needs to come off for him

0:48:22.850,0:48:26.450
well it didn't really

0:48:29.210,0:48:34.210
larger splash didn't control the entry

0:48:37.190,0:48:48.920
so just modest scores coming in in the

0:48:40.280,0:48:53.319
sevens 3.3 the difficulty discuss that

0:48:48.920,0:48:58.880
to tattoo it it's about his love of life

0:48:53.319,0:49:00.829
happy in Spanish is at betta its life 69

0:48:58.880,0:49:04.130
3 that's life don't always get the

0:49:00.829,0:49:07.670
scores you want whoever said life is

0:49:04.130,0:49:11.750
supposed to be fair and told Sakharov

0:49:07.670,0:49:14.440
next he's just a bar for cat at 11th

0:49:11.750,0:49:19.190
this forward four and a half somersault

0:49:14.440,0:49:21.710
or nice very good at this four and a

0:49:19.190,0:49:23.440
half somersault the divers have

0:49:21.710,0:49:30.740
attempted that this is one of the better

0:49:23.440,0:49:37.520
efforts very tight tuck position and

0:49:30.740,0:49:39.410
eights across the board for zakharov not

0:49:37.520,0:49:45.230
much to complain about there not much to

0:49:39.410,0:49:46.760
deduct so they don't 88.8 chinese would

0:49:45.230,0:49:51.799
think that was a lucky dive with all

0:49:46.760,0:49:54.920
those aids it's the lucky number I think

0:49:51.799,0:49:58.990
they prefer one hundred and eight they

0:49:54.920,0:50:01.609
rule it out Riley McCormick from Canada

0:49:58.990,0:50:03.559
trains and studies in Arizona State

0:50:01.609,0:50:05.740
University in the states this is an

0:50:03.559,0:50:10.190
inward three and a half somersault and

0:50:05.740,0:50:12.609
he's just out of the picture in 14th at

0:50:10.190,0:50:12.609
the moment

0:50:22.319,0:50:26.950
Eric Sain went out to the competition

0:50:25.000,0:50:30.190
last night Canada will be disappointed

0:50:26.950,0:50:35.079
if they didn't have a finalist in its

0:50:30.190,0:50:37.720
ten meter competition McLaurys going to

0:50:35.079,0:50:39.760
have to find something in the second

0:50:37.720,0:50:45.130
half of this semi-final or that was

0:50:39.760,0:50:48.730
close to just the feet rolled over a

0:50:45.130,0:50:54.160
little just to leave less than a 100

0:50:48.730,0:50:58.569
percent impression for the judges maybe

0:50:54.160,0:51:03.150
one six going to be tight around that

0:50:58.569,0:51:09.190
cutoff point yanked the AG wheeler from

0:51:03.150,0:51:13.660
Cuba back through and a half somersault

0:51:09.190,0:51:18.039
a couple of Olympic Games two World

0:51:13.660,0:51:20.589
Championships he would regard a final

0:51:18.039,0:51:23.280
position as reward for the training and

0:51:20.589,0:51:23.280
the dedication

0:51:27.190,0:51:31.940
okay we only had trouble with this dive

0:51:29.750,0:51:36.200
last night sixty four point eight only

0:51:31.940,0:51:40.520
and the judges aren't going to be too

0:51:36.200,0:51:46.090
generous again I would suggest these

0:51:40.520,0:51:49.100
issues with the entry he was well short

0:51:46.090,0:51:52.400
almost disastrously so in terms of the

0:51:49.100,0:51:55.490
scores was fives and a five and a half

0:51:52.400,0:52:01.370
four fifty five point eight and that

0:51:55.490,0:52:06.560
will be tough to recover from the

0:52:01.370,0:52:08.810
defending champion Matthew Mitchum only

0:52:06.560,0:52:12.260
non Chinese diver to win a medal in

0:52:08.810,0:52:23.450
Beijing ruined the clean sweep in with

0:52:12.260,0:52:24.500
three and a half somersault now or

0:52:23.450,0:52:26.750
beautiful

0:52:24.500,0:52:30.380
is back to near his best

0:52:26.750,0:52:31.530
[Applause]

0:52:30.380,0:52:34.900
[Music]

0:52:31.530,0:52:36.520
three point two that's like it

0:52:34.900,0:52:40.030
he loves to smile for the camera doesn't

0:52:36.520,0:52:42.700
he that he loves this stage well he is a

0:52:40.030,0:52:44.500
showman and to be fair even during the

0:52:42.700,0:52:49.390
difficulties last night he came up

0:52:44.500,0:52:51.640
smiling and waving at the camera I think

0:52:49.390,0:52:54.190
he's one of those athletes Roger he just

0:52:51.640,0:52:55.600
finds it a joy to be here wow I'm at the

0:52:54.190,0:52:58.890
Olympics he's old he's done it all

0:52:55.600,0:53:02.800
before but he just thrives on it and in

0:52:58.890,0:53:05.830
86.4 for Matthew he picked up another

0:53:02.800,0:53:09.790
five points on his prelim effort for the

0:53:05.830,0:53:11.860
same dive if he's feeling enjoyment and

0:53:09.790,0:53:13.720
no pressure that makes him even more

0:53:11.860,0:53:16.840
dangerous if he can relax into he's

0:53:13.720,0:53:21.370
diving Nick McCrory now from the United

0:53:16.840,0:53:23.620
States 13th as a forward four and a half

0:53:21.370,0:53:25.660
somersault with a three point seven

0:53:23.620,0:53:27.880
tariff which he will have been looking

0:53:25.660,0:53:32.080
to cash in on he just sounded a little

0:53:27.880,0:53:33.970
heavy footed on the platform and not

0:53:32.080,0:53:37.180
quite sure he really had a vertical body

0:53:33.970,0:53:39.850
on the entry here the replay will show

0:53:37.180,0:53:43.570
us not that the judges see this but he

0:53:39.850,0:53:45.370
was just still working his way out of

0:53:43.570,0:53:48.880
the somersaults as he entered the water

0:53:45.370,0:53:50.290
and so still bend at the hips just held

0:53:48.880,0:53:52.590
him back a little on his marks because

0:53:50.290,0:53:52.590
of that

0:53:53.790,0:54:07.920
maybe three to five high tariffs so that

0:53:58.710,0:54:10.350
helps alexander bondar from ukraine 15th

0:54:07.920,0:54:12.360
arm stand back double somersault two and

0:54:10.350,0:54:16.020
a half twist this was his problem last

0:54:12.360,0:54:18.830
night 57.6 for this dive so keep your

0:54:16.020,0:54:18.830
fingers crossed for him

0:54:26.690,0:54:30.019
long hold

0:54:39.599,0:54:46.119
well it's better than last night but

0:54:42.369,0:54:47.439
there's still room there it's it's a

0:54:46.119,0:54:49.079
real worry when they stay up there that

0:54:47.439,0:54:52.079
long

0:54:49.079,0:54:54.459
the ankles were never together until

0:54:52.079,0:54:58.149
entry really and it wasn't quite

0:54:54.459,0:55:02.409
vertical but he's got away with one in

0:54:58.149,0:55:06.639
terms of improvement from last night leg

0:55:02.409,0:55:07.959
form was pretty ropey one of the great

0:55:06.639,0:55:09.699
things about the games is how you've

0:55:07.959,0:55:12.219
sensed that the crowd is supporting

0:55:09.699,0:55:14.439
every competitor obviously the the Brits

0:55:12.219,0:55:16.179
are getting a massive support but you do

0:55:14.439,0:55:19.389
feel in those long pauses the crowd of

0:55:16.179,0:55:23.319
willing them to do it well he's picked

0:55:19.389,0:55:24.880
up 25 points there bond on high tariffs

0:55:23.319,0:55:31.359
on that dive even though there were a

0:55:24.880,0:55:34.509
couple of faults even Garcia is carrying

0:55:31.359,0:55:37.479
on from where he left off last night at

0:55:34.509,0:55:40.359
least in wood for a half somersault four

0:55:37.479,0:55:42.699
point one this this is a big dive and

0:55:40.359,0:55:45.759
he's in third place after his opening

0:55:42.699,0:55:47.649
two dives in four and a half somersaults

0:55:45.759,0:55:49.889
from a standing start you've got to be

0:55:47.649,0:55:49.889
quick

0:56:08.630,0:56:13.110
he was pretty quick I was just looking

0:56:11.580,0:56:15.570
to see how much knee bender was going to

0:56:13.110,0:56:18.870
be as he launched off the platform not a

0:56:15.570,0:56:24.150
great deal really even still generated

0:56:18.870,0:56:26.280
good power and the feet just came apart

0:56:24.150,0:56:28.470
for that to finish that's such a shame

0:56:26.280,0:56:35.280
to get from the split tuck to get the

0:56:28.470,0:56:38.910
ankles together timing not easy and an

0:56:35.280,0:56:41.670
eighty six point one long hold at the

0:56:38.910,0:56:44.340
top you can feel that 15,000 odd people

0:56:41.670,0:56:46.470
just all holding their breath wondering

0:56:44.340,0:56:48.720
when he's going to make that decision to

0:56:46.470,0:56:50.490
launch we were a little bit critical of

0:56:48.720,0:56:52.410
that dive but he still picked up nine

0:56:50.490,0:56:56.760
points for the on the same one from last

0:56:52.410,0:57:02.270
night when I say we it was me wasn't it

0:56:56.760,0:57:07.530
thank you Kevin Sanchez from Mexico

0:57:02.270,0:57:10.560
second after the opening couple of Dimes

0:57:07.530,0:57:15.650
arm stand back triple somersault and

0:57:10.560,0:57:15.650
again the pool hushed

0:57:16.700,0:57:21.970
oh dear

0:57:19.540,0:57:24.730
entry wise that's a disaster at this

0:57:21.970,0:57:27.190
level and he will be punished the judges

0:57:24.730,0:57:29.920
do not like to see that even if you do a

0:57:27.190,0:57:31.540
lot right before then which he seemed to

0:57:29.920,0:57:35.140
do but the timing was wrong

0:57:31.540,0:57:41.550
came out too early over-rotated massive

0:57:35.140,0:57:41.550
splash and he's under five right across

0:57:45.660,0:57:50.009
well they'll get away with that in the

0:57:48.299,0:57:52.859
semi-final stage having had such an

0:57:50.009,0:57:55.400
impressive start but that's got to go if

0:57:52.859,0:57:55.400
he's there tonight

0:57:56.269,0:58:04.140
Martin Wolfram has been outstanding

0:58:00.259,0:58:11.430
reverse three-and-a-half somersault top

0:58:04.140,0:58:15.750
of the pile at the moment he may stay

0:58:11.430,0:58:17.369
there that was a good effort degree of

0:58:15.750,0:58:23.700
difficulty we'll just hold him back a

0:58:17.369,0:58:25.970
little a three point three he competed

0:58:23.700,0:58:28.829
here in February of that World Cup event

0:58:25.970,0:58:31.619
which gave many of the divers a chance

0:58:28.829,0:58:34.470
to sample the atmosphere and the water

0:58:31.619,0:58:35.460
he was ninth in the Timmy to platform

0:58:34.470,0:58:37.200
then but he is a bit of an unknown

0:58:35.460,0:58:39.150
quantity and maybe wanted to the others

0:58:37.200,0:58:45.180
will be wondering just how much this

0:58:39.150,0:58:51.180
guy's got in his locker seventy nine

0:58:45.180,0:58:56.460
point two for Martin she's lowest dive

0:58:51.180,0:59:00.240
so far Sascha Klein up next back a bit

0:58:56.460,0:59:02.069
after good work last night and the start

0:59:00.240,0:59:05.009
of today now he's got an arm stand back

0:59:02.069,0:59:09.740
triple somersault through three point

0:59:05.009,0:59:09.740
five the tariff he's in eighth place

0:59:12.540,0:59:17.580
well this was his top dive in the

0:59:14.680,0:59:28.450
prelims and maybe it will be again 90

0:59:17.580,0:59:34.360
2.75 last night for Sasha takes a lovely

0:59:28.450,0:59:36.850
Pike position he did get a couple of 9s

0:59:34.360,0:59:43.210
for it last night eight and a half's and

0:59:36.850,0:59:46.720
eight so not quite as good but

0:59:43.210,0:59:51.640
delightful to watch well-executed and an

0:59:46.720,0:59:53.850
eighty nine to five seems fairly happy

0:59:51.640,0:59:57.430
with the way the competition is going

0:59:53.850,0:59:59.770
wonderful same can be said for Lynn UA

0:59:57.430,1:00:03.550
who will have only the very highest

0:59:59.770,1:00:05.410
level of expectations he's fourth after

1:00:03.550,1:00:10.120
two rounds back three and a half

1:00:05.410,1:00:13.170
somersault boys now that again that was

1:00:10.120,1:00:21.190
the only 100 point died last night

1:00:13.170,1:00:23.080
even Chabot couldn't this one oh he's

1:00:21.190,1:00:24.860
just perfect through the air

1:00:23.080,1:00:26.970
[Music]

1:00:24.860,1:00:29.349
[Applause]

1:00:26.970,1:00:31.640
[Music]

1:00:29.349,1:00:37.040
unbelievable and nine and a half's come

1:00:31.640,1:00:39.619
in and we're heading for three digits

1:00:37.040,1:00:42.980
here he got a 10 there that's going to

1:00:39.619,1:00:45.619
be taken out with three nine and a

1:00:42.980,1:00:49.450
half's and a 102 point six there it is

1:00:45.619,1:00:51.980
our first hundred point dive in the semi

1:00:49.450,1:00:53.619
there may well be a competition within

1:00:51.980,1:00:56.660
the competition between these two

1:00:53.619,1:00:59.180
Chinese teammates and rivals of course

1:00:56.660,1:01:02.359
Chabot now reversed three and a half

1:00:59.180,1:01:04.339
somersault and a disappointing second

1:01:02.359,1:01:10.369
dive which is really quite out of

1:01:04.339,1:01:11.780
character he's back that's not a 100

1:01:10.369,1:01:18.440
point dive because he doesn't have the

1:01:11.780,1:01:20.359
tariff but the form is there see how

1:01:18.440,1:01:23.680
much deeper into a squat he gets to

1:01:20.359,1:01:23.680
drive up off the platform

1:01:26.920,1:01:35.859
he has got a history of landing plenty

1:01:29.450,1:01:40.309
of tens 25 perfect tens in a in a series

1:01:35.859,1:01:45.500
back in 2011 a FINA diving World Series

1:01:40.309,1:01:50.140
event in Beijing 90 405 exactly the same

1:01:45.500,1:01:53.150
markers that I've yielded last night

1:01:50.140,1:01:55.130
now this would be interesting Lin ua has

1:01:53.150,1:02:00.020
taken over at the top of the leaderboard

1:01:55.130,1:02:02.869
David Boudia scum from 18th to 3rd the

1:02:00.020,1:02:04.910
Mexican of the Germans still holding

1:02:02.869,1:02:07.760
their own Tom Daley has worked his way

1:02:04.910,1:02:10.970
up the field as well Matthew Mitchum

1:02:07.760,1:02:13.039
just ahead of the cut Nick McCrory

1:02:10.970,1:02:13.789
Rowley McCormick are the ones under

1:02:13.039,1:02:17.770
pressure

1:02:13.789,1:02:20.690
Alexander Bondar hanging on in there

1:02:17.770,1:02:27.140
12 remember the cutoff to go through to

1:02:20.690,1:02:31.029
tonight's final the standard has gone up

1:02:27.140,1:02:33.619
a notch or two from last night I

1:02:31.029,1:02:36.500
undeniably rods there you see this

1:02:33.619,1:02:38.270
across competitions qualifying the top

1:02:36.500,1:02:40.119
boys just want to get there and they're

1:02:38.270,1:02:45.650
holding something back

1:02:40.119,1:02:47.950
not now David Boudia is transformed

1:02:45.650,1:02:47.950
overnight

1:02:52.750,1:03:00.500
he's now in third place reverse three

1:02:56.869,1:03:06.079
and a half somersault for his fourth

1:03:00.500,1:03:07.369
dive three point three the tariff well

1:03:06.079,1:03:08.000
he'll be relieved to have done a good

1:03:07.369,1:03:10.880
job with that

1:03:08.000,1:03:14.119
that was the dive that got him only 44

1:03:10.880,1:03:16.430
points last night eliminate that from

1:03:14.119,1:03:18.740
his total come up with something better

1:03:16.430,1:03:20.869
which he's certainly done here and he'll

1:03:18.740,1:03:23.140
continue to be knocking around the top

1:03:20.869,1:03:23.140
five

1:03:29.040,1:03:33.430
Matthew Mitchum made mention of this man

1:03:32.500,1:03:35.590
when he was talking about the

1:03:33.430,1:03:37.150
inconsistent performances across the

1:03:35.590,1:03:39.340
preliminary Sir David Byrd ah he doesn't

1:03:37.150,1:03:48.100
belong in 18th position and he won't be

1:03:39.340,1:03:53.350
there 85 Boyd eight things going much

1:03:48.100,1:03:57.370
better for the American cause agüero he

1:03:53.350,1:03:59.590
too has improved significantly from the

1:03:57.370,1:04:02.230
preliminary competition he's up into

1:03:59.590,1:04:07.780
ninth place arm stand reverse triple

1:04:02.230,1:04:10.660
somersault for his fourth dive in his

1:04:07.780,1:04:21.580
sixth dive program three point four the

1:04:10.660,1:04:23.850
tariff well done excuse me he this was

1:04:21.580,1:04:28.290
his top scoring dive last night and he

1:04:23.850,1:04:28.290
might be able to do the same again

1:04:32.260,1:04:35.590
I wonder what the penalty would be for

1:04:33.970,1:04:42.700
dragging their towel into the pool with

1:04:35.590,1:04:46.420
you experience Thailand he was fifth in

1:04:42.700,1:04:50.800
Beijing half instan go sir well 25th

1:04:46.420,1:04:53.710
14th in Sydney oh he's not looking too

1:04:50.800,1:04:57.760
comfortable back problems plagued many

1:04:53.710,1:04:59.830
of these top athletes in the pool and at

1:04:57.760,1:05:03.660
the gymnastics and the sports are

1:04:59.830,1:05:10.870
closely related as I'm sure you're aware

1:05:03.660,1:05:13.960
Gleb galperin now from Russia oh that's

1:05:10.870,1:05:17.640
better much better he's been a little

1:05:13.960,1:05:17.640
inconsistent through his first three

1:05:20.730,1:05:25.920
he's the one who missed a couple of

1:05:23.099,1:05:29.819
years through injury I mean he's a

1:05:25.920,1:05:32.280
proven competitor and I think he's just

1:05:29.819,1:05:36.180
proved it well he needs to lift himself

1:05:32.280,1:05:39.990
up the standings in a 99.1 for galperin

1:05:36.180,1:05:42.660
his best dive so far his second dive was

1:05:39.990,1:05:44.430
a 37.4 so he's really got to rattle up

1:05:42.660,1:05:50.490
some big numbers with his closing two

1:05:44.430,1:05:56.130
dives as well as that one here comes the

1:05:50.490,1:05:57.569
heartthrob young Tom Daly I'm feeling

1:05:56.130,1:05:59.579
he's still gonna be young Tom Daley in

1:05:57.569,1:06:02.869
about 10 years time because everybody

1:05:59.579,1:06:06.859
just has that view of him in Britain

1:06:02.869,1:06:06.859
forward four and a half somersault

1:06:09.079,1:06:14.960
nicely done again gives the crowd plenty

1:06:12.540,1:06:14.960
the cheer

1:06:16.800,1:06:27.330
willing him on willing the judges not to

1:06:21.720,1:06:29.070
give him a good score as well just short

1:06:27.330,1:06:31.340
of the vertical but again he's one of

1:06:29.070,1:06:33.960
these divers as the top boys can just

1:06:31.340,1:06:41.100
minimizes the splash what whatever the

1:06:33.960,1:06:44.220
entry angle so will Mak to that GB

1:06:41.100,1:06:46.500
success has stunned many of the home

1:06:44.220,1:06:50.370
fans I can tell you and Tom Daley has to

1:06:46.500,1:06:52.110
turn that expectation into inspiration

1:06:50.370,1:06:54.390
as many other athletes have done and

1:06:52.110,1:06:57.570
found that the the crowd support has

1:06:54.390,1:07:00.320
really taken them the extra mile here at

1:06:57.570,1:07:03.920
point eight and again he's Daly's

1:07:00.320,1:07:07.070
improving across the board

1:07:03.920,1:07:09.480
Victor mini buy of his 10th

1:07:07.070,1:07:12.750
stand back double somersault two and a

1:07:09.480,1:07:16.160
half twist three point six and needing

1:07:12.750,1:07:16.160
to maintain those standards

1:07:28.050,1:07:33.940
a little untidy at the bottom I'm not

1:07:32.440,1:07:35.140
sure if he was waving to someone with

1:07:33.940,1:07:40.570
his toes or just looking for that

1:07:35.140,1:07:48.160
extension from fingers to toes but he's

1:07:40.570,1:07:49.960
over rotated there we go not sure what

1:07:48.160,1:07:51.310
that achieves except to give us

1:07:49.960,1:07:53.200
something to talk about Roger

1:07:51.310,1:07:56.980
maybe it's like maybe it's like a

1:07:53.200,1:07:58.600
trigger hmm quite all the performers and

1:07:56.980,1:08:00.820
even golfers talk about the trigger when

1:07:58.600,1:08:04.150
he's just going to decide when to when

1:08:00.820,1:08:14.370
to do it yeah make yourself move forward

1:08:04.150,1:08:20.140
press Victor Ortega from Colombia 17th

1:08:14.370,1:08:22.380
in with three and a half somersault he

1:08:20.140,1:08:25.560
really doesn't matter round up there

1:08:22.380,1:08:25.560
executed well

1:08:28.520,1:08:31.589
[Music]

1:08:34.389,1:08:38.799
feet just slightly apart on entry but

1:08:36.520,1:08:41.790
again from sidon it's one of those

1:08:38.799,1:08:44.309
little faults you can get away with

1:08:41.790,1:08:49.150
considering the judges position as they

1:08:44.309,1:08:51.940
study the dive 78 for picked up a few

1:08:49.150,1:08:53.469
marks on his preliminary effort many of

1:08:51.940,1:08:55.440
the divers he says that half his

1:08:53.469,1:08:58.679
training is actually out of the water

1:08:55.440,1:09:01.359
two or four hours a day spent in the gym

1:08:58.679,1:09:02.199
anton zakharov now reversed three and a

1:09:01.359,1:09:13.119
half somersault

1:09:02.199,1:09:16.000
he's down in 7th place I think he had a

1:09:13.119,1:09:20.409
better entry position than when the

1:09:16.000,1:09:22.310
splash indicated sometimes it works the

1:09:20.409,1:09:23.800
other way

1:09:22.310,1:09:26.080
[Music]

1:09:23.800,1:09:30.460
he is pretty much vertical but just

1:09:26.080,1:09:38.850
couldn't match that angle with the

1:09:30.460,1:09:42.880
splash he's done well 84 1 5 zakharov

1:09:38.850,1:09:44.850
moving along quite nicely scores in the

1:09:42.880,1:09:48.700
70s and 80s

1:09:44.850,1:09:50.860
Riley mcCormick his fourth divers an

1:09:48.700,1:09:52.570
armed stand back triple somersault we're

1:09:50.860,1:09:55.420
getting to the journals about on every

1:09:52.570,1:09:58.270
20 minutes which is 10 minutes less than

1:09:55.420,1:10:00.220
last night so getting a chance to get

1:09:58.270,1:10:02.680
into a little bit more of a rhythm once

1:10:00.220,1:10:12.250
he gets into that armstand position for

1:10:02.680,1:10:14.910
the back triple somersault very good

1:10:12.250,1:10:17.950
very good

1:10:14.910,1:10:21.570
so three point three the tariff sixty

1:10:17.950,1:10:24.070
nine point three for this one last night

1:10:21.570,1:10:28.320
not the tightest tuck position you'll

1:10:24.070,1:10:35.610
see like the entry angle

1:10:28.320,1:10:35.610
kicks it out from the platform very tidy

1:10:36.540,1:10:42.100
judges are proved with those eights

1:10:39.480,1:10:46.560
seventy nine point two that keeps him in

1:10:42.100,1:10:46.560
the hunt for a place in tonight's final

1:10:47.760,1:10:56.230
young Claire Aguilar from Cuba still has

1:10:53.200,1:10:59.710
work to do I'm staying back double

1:10:56.230,1:11:02.460
somersault one and a half twists three

1:10:59.710,1:11:05.560
point to another lower Terrace so

1:11:02.460,1:11:10.620
execution has to be exemplary if he's

1:11:05.560,1:11:10.620
going to make a run for the final twelve

1:11:11.310,1:11:14.580
good hold

1:11:17.059,1:11:24.750
wonderful entry not quite square for my

1:11:20.790,1:11:27.389
view but the position with the at least

1:11:24.750,1:11:29.639
as far as vertical as concerned was a 1

1:11:27.389,1:11:36.900
and was splashed not there at all so

1:11:29.639,1:11:38.099
good impression well one of those nines

1:11:36.900,1:11:42.619
is going to count because there was

1:11:38.099,1:11:42.619
three of them and that will help

1:11:47.360,1:11:52.760
and then eighty three point two is

1:11:50.600,1:11:58.880
picked up 13 points for that dive from

1:11:52.760,1:12:00.800
the prelims that's a bonus now the four

1:11:58.880,1:12:03.320
men who retained their 10-meter title

1:12:00.800,1:12:06.170
were Samuel Lee Robert Webster both

1:12:03.320,1:12:10.190
Americans the famous Klaus DiBiase from

1:12:06.170,1:12:14.360
Italy and Greg Louganis the most iconic

1:12:10.190,1:12:16.130
figure perhaps in diving Matthew Mitchum

1:12:14.360,1:12:19.210
pretty iconic himself in his own way

1:12:16.130,1:12:27.320
reverse three and half somersault oh

1:12:19.210,1:12:29.540
well he he must have slept well I think

1:12:27.320,1:12:33.050
he just faces it now he did impression

1:12:29.540,1:12:37.240
don't you he's happy to be here and a

1:12:33.050,1:12:44.840
happy competitor is often a good one boy

1:12:37.240,1:12:46.790
wait for this the judges really liked

1:12:44.840,1:12:48.280
what they saw from Mitchum here and with

1:12:46.790,1:12:56.330
good reason

1:12:48.280,1:12:57.950
near perfection this is the joy of

1:12:56.330,1:13:03.340
competition I would like to see that

1:12:57.950,1:13:05.600
from anyone and a 90 point seven five I

1:13:03.340,1:13:08.330
think the other divers have been looking

1:13:05.600,1:13:11.420
across and just thinking oh he might be

1:13:08.330,1:13:14.720
on a little bit of a bit of a ride

1:13:11.420,1:13:17.720
Nick McCrory that's rather more

1:13:14.720,1:13:22.310
pragmatic problems ahead of him

1:13:17.720,1:13:26.500
12 right on that cut line reverse three

1:13:22.310,1:13:26.500
and a half somersault for the American

1:13:28.209,1:13:35.840
well that's beautiful dive by dive we're

1:13:33.409,1:13:37.699
just seeing the standard improved I know

1:13:35.840,1:13:39.199
we're moving up to the higher seated

1:13:37.699,1:13:42.940
divers but they're not disappointing

1:13:39.199,1:13:42.940
that they're living up to their rankings

1:13:47.420,1:13:56.130
so or solid nines here McCrory well this

1:13:54.720,1:13:58.500
is what we should be seeing we want to

1:13:56.130,1:14:01.680
see the medals tonight decided on

1:13:58.500,1:14:03.420
excellence not on somebody making a

1:14:01.680,1:14:05.370
mistake or slipping out of it you know

1:14:03.420,1:14:07.680
you want to see the top divers really

1:14:05.370,1:14:11.180
pressed into something that dazzles and

1:14:07.680,1:14:11.180
gets this crowd right up on their feet

1:14:11.570,1:14:19.110
Alexandre bond up 14th place and

1:14:16.820,1:14:25.050
fighting to stay in the competition with

1:14:19.110,1:14:27.570
the back three and a half somersault got

1:14:25.050,1:14:30.260
it got all of it that's a great dive

1:14:27.570,1:14:30.260
from banda

1:14:30.710,1:14:36.370
[Applause]

1:14:33.000,1:14:37.989
Stacy's ambitions was being wanting to

1:14:36.370,1:14:41.040
become an Olympic champion and then

1:14:37.989,1:14:46.600
Sports Minister if that's okay

1:14:41.040,1:14:47.949
we were like ambition there's nothing

1:14:46.600,1:14:52.320
wrong with a sports minister being a

1:14:47.949,1:14:55.360
former athlete no no something about it

1:14:52.320,1:14:57.250
certain said Coe has gone into the more

1:14:55.360,1:14:59.739
political sphere and done all right with

1:14:57.250,1:15:01.719
these games so who knows in the future

1:14:59.739,1:15:05.620
no it's been an outstanding experience

1:15:01.719,1:15:07.150
for all of us and as an outsider you say

1:15:05.620,1:15:08.890
that there it's been an absolute

1:15:07.150,1:15:12.449
pleasure to be here and see a well run

1:15:08.890,1:15:19.270
games and totally enjoyable experience

1:15:12.449,1:15:23.770
well said even Garcia having a good

1:15:19.270,1:15:26.650
morning fourth I'm standing back double

1:15:23.770,1:15:30.000
somersault two and a half twists for the

1:15:26.650,1:15:30.000
synchro silver medalist

1:15:44.420,1:15:49.770
yes he just sort of lent into the

1:15:47.880,1:15:55.470
dispatch from the platform then pushed

1:15:49.770,1:16:00.540
off and the hesitation in the end led to

1:15:55.470,1:16:02.760
some indifferent execution sevens that

1:16:00.540,1:16:08.300
he would have liked more he's gonna be

1:16:02.760,1:16:08.300
okay he's come in as the sixth highest

1:16:08.870,1:16:15.120
and he's only had scores in the 80s

1:16:11.720,1:16:19.350
that'll get the job done but that one

1:16:15.120,1:16:26.520
wasn't his best an 81 his lower score so

1:16:19.350,1:16:36.380
far we second of the two Mexican divers

1:16:26.520,1:16:39.120
they're both from Guadalajara he's got a

1:16:36.380,1:16:43.200
german sanchez inward four-and-a-half

1:16:39.120,1:16:46.170
somersault four point one this is a big

1:16:43.200,1:16:49.280
one this is his toughest dive he nearly

1:16:46.170,1:16:49.280
got a hundred for it last night

1:17:03.530,1:17:09.409
well I can't see that getting around 98

1:17:09.530,1:17:15.540
high tariffs so if you were get most of

1:17:14.190,1:17:18.270
the value out of it then you're going to

1:17:15.540,1:17:21.210
get a very good score but the feet were

1:17:18.270,1:17:23.520
apart there and the splash not ideal and

1:17:21.210,1:17:25.860
the the judges didn't miss that little

1:17:23.520,1:17:28.679
form break or the splash of course it's

1:17:25.860,1:17:32.699
the most obvious indication of a problem

1:17:28.679,1:17:38.550
with the entry straight into the

1:17:32.699,1:17:42.270
analysis but an 86 instead of a 98 and a

1:17:38.550,1:17:44.670
12-point slip they're talking of let's

1:17:42.270,1:17:48.150
they Martine vault frame has just aged

1:17:44.670,1:17:50.099
back a bit after a really impressive

1:17:48.150,1:17:53.159
start again and you come up to this

1:17:50.099,1:17:55.500
level of competition back three and a

1:17:53.159,1:17:59.510
half somersault three point six still

1:17:55.500,1:17:59.510
sitting in fifth place

1:18:02.329,1:18:06.290
good effort Wolfram

1:18:07.790,1:18:11.660
he was one of those divers last night

1:18:09.680,1:18:13.490
who climbed up the rankings very

1:18:11.660,1:18:16.460
consistently after his second dive he

1:18:13.490,1:18:17.000
went from 19th the 10th to 8 to 6 to

1:18:16.460,1:18:20.600
fourth

1:18:17.000,1:18:26.390
so he really moved into the competition

1:18:20.600,1:18:27.860
with some momentum you might be tempted

1:18:26.390,1:18:31.400
to have him as a bit of an each-way

1:18:27.860,1:18:34.540
because quite sure just how much he can

1:18:31.400,1:18:44.320
pile on but he's he's done very well

1:18:34.540,1:18:48.230
96 for Sasha Klein more experienced

1:18:44.320,1:18:49.820
German diver 26 years of age serves in

1:18:48.230,1:18:57.200
the Army back three and a half

1:18:49.820,1:19:04.220
somersault biked 3.6 well very nice

1:18:57.200,1:19:09.920
again he's so consistent his dives last

1:19:04.220,1:19:14.600
night range from 81 to 92 left him the

1:19:09.920,1:19:18.140
third highest qualifier in that respect

1:19:14.600,1:19:20.270
he's like a Chinese divers that just

1:19:18.140,1:19:23.890
doesn't give you anything bad so he's

1:19:20.270,1:19:26.120
gonna be he's gonna be there abouts we

1:19:23.890,1:19:29.540
can just pull out a moment of

1:19:26.120,1:19:31.610
inspiration he might want fancy his

1:19:29.540,1:19:36.290
chances of getting on the podium this

1:19:31.610,1:19:39.890
evening Lin UA now leading the field

1:19:36.290,1:19:47.780
forward four and a half somersault 3.7

1:19:39.890,1:19:50.220
for the 21-year old remember is just

1:19:47.780,1:19:53.929
coming off a dive of 102

1:19:50.220,1:19:59.840
[Applause]

1:19:53.929,1:20:01.999
last night this one earned him 92 and

1:19:59.840,1:20:04.099
he's taking the challenge - chuubo the

1:20:01.999,1:20:07.399
Middle's aren't on the line yet but he

1:20:04.099,1:20:10.329
is making a statement I think I'm going

1:20:07.399,1:20:10.329
to be putting the pressure on

1:20:13.209,1:20:19.959
he is a long way up from that Wide Shut

1:20:15.559,1:20:19.959
thing three stories up if you like

1:20:20.320,1:20:24.760
perfect form as he enters the water

1:20:26.229,1:20:34.129
ninety four three five looks

1:20:30.469,1:20:37.639
disappointed with a 94 he hadn't himself

1:20:34.129,1:20:42.679
Linney's five four and eight stone five

1:20:37.639,1:20:45.139
cube oh five three and nine two complex

1:20:42.679,1:20:50.629
powerful figure now back three and a

1:20:45.139,1:20:53.590
half somersault and a lot of tubers

1:20:50.629,1:21:00.800
power evident there comes through those

1:20:53.590,1:21:02.749
strong thighs big knee bent here up and

1:21:00.800,1:21:04.939
away and that allows him to get through

1:21:02.749,1:21:08.329
those somersaults so quickly look for

1:21:04.939,1:21:09.979
the water and then say to the judges

1:21:08.329,1:21:13.369
what have you got for me well nine and a

1:21:09.979,1:21:19.729
half and a ten in there but the ten goes

1:21:13.369,1:21:21.979
out it's one of the top two he's back Oh

1:21:19.729,1:21:26.989
a hundred and two point six if you don't

1:21:21.979,1:21:30.260
mind and that's his first triple digit

1:21:26.989,1:21:32.059
score for the competition - Chinese

1:21:30.260,1:21:34.059
divers are definitely pushing each other

1:21:32.059,1:21:37.789
in this competition

1:21:34.059,1:21:40.429
Xu has been beaten by Lin this year

1:21:37.789,1:21:42.949
there's the leaderboard after round for

1:21:40.429,1:21:44.899
China one and two David Boudia still

1:21:42.949,1:21:47.869
doing well Sasha Klein and Martin

1:21:44.899,1:21:49.789
Wolfram and Tom Daley just working his

1:21:47.869,1:21:52.010
way up the field in seventh now here's

1:21:49.789,1:21:55.610
what really matters this morning Victor

1:21:52.010,1:21:56.599
mini buy of twelfth and Banda from

1:21:55.610,1:21:59.209
Ukraine

1:21:56.599,1:22:00.679
well he's point seven five behind him a

1:21:59.209,1:22:03.260
little bit more of a gap - Riley

1:22:00.679,1:22:05.840
McCormack but nothing between the

1:22:03.260,1:22:06.890
Russian and the Ukrainian not that

1:22:05.840,1:22:09.380
there's any rivalry

1:22:06.890,1:22:12.230
between those two camps anyway but only

1:22:09.380,1:22:14.090
0.6 between first and second so a real

1:22:12.230,1:22:16.940
battle at the top a real battle on the

1:22:14.090,1:22:18.800
bubble and a great little session

1:22:16.940,1:22:21.050
unfolding here and we're lucky to be

1:22:18.800,1:22:22.490
here Roger it's just the joy and those

1:22:21.050,1:22:24.200
watching who've got tickets for tonight

1:22:22.490,1:22:26.510
will feel even luckier still because

1:22:24.200,1:22:30.830
they know for the atmosphere the tension

1:22:26.510,1:22:31.490
is going to rise yet again and David

1:22:30.830,1:22:35.000
Boudia

1:22:31.490,1:22:38.810
has come out here the Smalling and made

1:22:35.000,1:22:39.470
sure he's in the frame to be a serious

1:22:38.810,1:22:43.220
contender

1:22:39.470,1:22:50.710
I don't want to say for the bronze medal

1:22:43.220,1:22:50.710
position but he is third after

1:22:50.740,1:22:56.630
back three and a half somersault there

1:22:53.650,1:22:58.970
little splashy on landing if I can put

1:22:56.630,1:23:01.160
it that way but David is diving much

1:22:58.970,1:23:03.140
more to his experience and reputation

1:23:01.160,1:23:04.060
here in the semi-final and in the

1:23:03.140,1:23:07.640
prelims

1:23:04.060,1:23:11.470
he's just folded that over a little to

1:23:07.640,1:23:18.980
create the bigger than desirable splash

1:23:11.470,1:23:23.180
he wasn't far from vertical and an

1:23:18.980,1:23:24.950
eighty two point eight runs in the

1:23:23.180,1:23:26.750
synchro where the great avala to the

1:23:24.950,1:23:29.090
synchro is you've only got one Chinese

1:23:26.750,1:23:32.240
opponent to beat as he were whereas here

1:23:29.090,1:23:34.310
with two individual competitors then it

1:23:32.240,1:23:38.840
makes it doubly difficult to get on that

1:23:34.310,1:23:41.210
podium Jose Guerra tenth wants to get

1:23:38.840,1:23:45.460
into that final tonight reverse three

1:23:41.210,1:23:45.460
and a half somersault three point three

1:23:47.650,1:23:52.010
well again he jumped well out from the

1:23:50.059,1:23:55.429
platform but in no way did that stop him

1:23:52.010,1:23:58.090
getting through the somersaults and he's

1:23:55.429,1:24:01.210
done an excellent job with the entry

1:23:58.090,1:24:05.630
minimal splash here even if he wasn't

1:24:01.210,1:24:16.489
quite at the vertical yes he was at a

1:24:05.630,1:24:24.130
bit of an angle judges liked it there's

1:24:16.489,1:24:24.130
79 to just a modest tariff there of 3.3

1:24:27.249,1:24:34.130
web galperin started off the preliminary

1:24:31.309,1:24:35.840
round so well very quickly into his

1:24:34.130,1:24:39.199
reverse three and a half somersault

1:24:35.840,1:24:44.929
straight off the board as soon as he was

1:24:39.199,1:24:48.170
called 17th after four dives this dive

1:24:44.929,1:24:49.909
only got in 34 point six five last night

1:24:48.170,1:24:52.820
was the one that nearly tipped him out

1:24:49.909,1:24:55.969
of the top 18 he's got so much to do to

1:24:52.820,1:24:59.530
get into the top 12 because he's he's

1:24:55.969,1:25:01.969
had one very bad dive of 37 he's second

1:24:59.530,1:25:05.420
make up some ground here with an 89

1:25:01.969,1:25:07.670
point one so he's potentially making a

1:25:05.420,1:25:10.610
late run into the 12 but lots to do

1:25:07.670,1:25:12.530
still well Greg Alfred had barely hit

1:25:10.610,1:25:16.130
the water before the raw started to

1:25:12.530,1:25:18.679
build up to an ounce Tom Daly onto the

1:25:16.130,1:25:20.749
platform Daly getting more into his

1:25:18.679,1:25:24.920
stride up into seventh back three and a

1:25:20.749,1:25:28.999
half somersault for the 2009 world

1:25:24.920,1:25:33.099
champion back three and a half

1:25:28.999,1:25:33.099
somersault then hiked

1:25:35.700,1:25:41.050
that's a great effort no no no how much

1:25:39.040,1:25:45.910
mental damage is done by doing a dive

1:25:41.050,1:25:52.750
badly but this one last night 39.6 but

1:25:45.910,1:25:59.710
he is now that no problems at all

1:25:52.750,1:26:01.720
where was the splash not there and

1:25:59.710,1:26:04.270
you're getting a very strong impression

1:26:01.720,1:26:06.790
that not only will he be in the final

1:26:04.270,1:26:09.370
he's a contender with at ninety one

1:26:06.790,1:26:11.380
point eight and that's now Tom's best

1:26:09.370,1:26:11.880
dive of the competition last night and

1:26:11.380,1:26:15.940
today

1:26:11.880,1:26:20.980
well boost his confidence no end victor

1:26:15.940,1:26:24.190
mini by of living on the edge down 12th

1:26:20.980,1:26:32.110
position now it's the back three and a

1:26:24.190,1:26:34.410
half somersault his fifth dive takes his

1:26:32.110,1:26:34.410
time

1:26:36.810,1:26:40.440
really chases time

1:26:42.510,1:26:46.900
we're like TallyMan above had a bit of

1:26:45.160,1:26:48.640
mental baggage to leave up on the

1:26:46.900,1:26:52.510
platform with that died that yielded you

1:26:48.640,1:26:54.910
less than fifty last night great push

1:26:52.510,1:26:57.550
off the platform beautiful straight legs

1:26:54.910,1:27:02.520
in the pike reaches for the water the

1:26:57.550,1:27:02.520
feet coming over just a tiny amount

1:27:04.920,1:27:10.530
pressure on as we get late into this

1:27:07.330,1:27:16.140
competition to force your way into that

1:27:10.530,1:27:18.970
1291 point eight huge well-timed

1:27:16.140,1:27:24.370
just when he needed the boost of the

1:27:18.970,1:27:26.860
points Victor Ortega back in eighteenth

1:27:24.370,1:27:29.860
and maybe just wanted to complete his

1:27:26.860,1:27:31.480
Olympic spirits with a couple of solid

1:27:29.860,1:27:36.670
dives back three and a half somersault

1:27:31.480,1:27:38.410
now well better if he's one of those

1:27:36.670,1:27:40.450
competitors Roger doesn't like to leave

1:27:38.410,1:27:41.830
himself hesitating up there too long for

1:27:40.450,1:27:44.650
the negative thoughts to enter he's

1:27:41.830,1:27:49.030
straight into his work this is one of

1:27:44.650,1:27:55.230
his better dives here in the semi hasn't

1:27:49.030,1:27:55.230
been his session solid eights though

1:27:58.200,1:28:06.840
had more success as a synchro diver six

1:28:02.410,1:28:06.840
in the Beijing Olympic Games

1:28:09.180,1:28:18.160
Anton zakharov ninth place fifth dive

1:28:13.690,1:28:25.990
arm stand back triple somersault all the

1:28:18.160,1:28:27.640
twenty six-year-old well we didn't hold

1:28:25.990,1:28:30.280
it for too long up there and maybe not

1:28:27.640,1:28:34.960
for long enough that's a poor dive for

1:28:30.280,1:28:40.780
zakharov a shocking angle coming in to

1:28:34.960,1:28:41.320
the water and hence the big splash too

1:28:40.780,1:28:44.890
late

1:28:41.320,1:28:47.580
kicking it out he was almost at 45

1:28:44.890,1:28:50.110
degrees and a 3675

1:28:47.580,1:28:52.780
that will hurt could have cost him a

1:28:50.110,1:28:56.140
place in the final that one mistake

1:28:52.780,1:28:58.390
that's what it's all about it's the the

1:28:56.140,1:29:02.230
pressure knowing that you cannot afford

1:28:58.390,1:29:06.570
to blow one dive and succeed Riley

1:29:02.230,1:29:08.650
McCormick close to the top pole 14th

1:29:06.570,1:29:12.250
reverse three-and-a-half somersault

1:29:08.650,1:29:20.020
might just see this as a chance to cash

1:29:12.250,1:29:23.410
in after a Sakharov disappointment very

1:29:20.020,1:29:25.480
good so when you're eliminating from 18

1:29:23.410,1:29:27.010
down to 12 and you're on the bubble you

1:29:25.480,1:29:31.000
start to look around so Who am I going

1:29:27.010,1:29:33.040
to beat here McCormick might have

1:29:31.000,1:29:36.180
slipped ahead of a couple with this it's

1:29:33.040,1:29:36.180
an excellent dive

1:29:38.850,1:29:45.100
it's the real competition here this

1:29:41.560,1:29:47.200
morning is down of in this sort of 9th

1:29:45.100,1:29:51.880
to 15th because they're the ones are

1:29:47.200,1:29:56.710
under the most pressure 79 went to there

1:29:51.880,1:29:59.310
for McCormick better result than last

1:29:56.710,1:30:04.380
night which was a 64 for that dive

1:29:59.310,1:30:08.110
this is young Claire Aguilar from Cuba

1:30:04.380,1:30:11.800
looking to reach the final for the first

1:30:08.110,1:30:13.600
time 16th place might just be a stretch

1:30:11.800,1:30:21.520
too far for him reverse three and a half

1:30:13.600,1:30:23.440
somersault a Yank --let stormed home

1:30:21.520,1:30:26.440
last night in the prelims going from

1:30:23.440,1:30:31.440
19th place to 12th to 10th these last

1:30:26.440,1:30:31.440
few dives this one

1:30:32.310,1:30:40.560
not such a good result just coming in at

1:30:36.540,1:30:42.870
that less than ideal angle so all in the

1:30:40.560,1:30:45.500
timing of kicking out from the last

1:30:42.870,1:30:45.500
somersault

1:30:49.550,1:30:56.100
now mr. Mitchum what have you got for us

1:30:52.260,1:30:59.390
this time I'm staring back triple

1:30:56.100,1:31:03.870
somersault three point three the tariff

1:30:59.390,1:31:06.090
stand seems an awful long way up for all

1:31:03.870,1:31:11.550
the most powerfully built divers in

1:31:06.090,1:31:18.600
world diving really expect the

1:31:11.550,1:31:22.040
unexpected from Matthew pretty good

1:31:18.600,1:31:22.040
I think he's safely through

1:31:25.619,1:31:32.189
this was only a 66 dive for him in the

1:31:29.949,1:31:32.189
prelims

1:31:35.030,1:31:40.660
not his perfect line on entry that we

1:31:37.040,1:31:40.660
saw from his previous dive

1:31:41.350,1:31:48.610
he's just edging closer grimace this

1:31:45.800,1:31:52.940
time he knows he left a bit out there

1:31:48.610,1:31:55.250
had a severe abdominal muscle tear which

1:31:52.940,1:31:58.840
cost him a place in last year's World

1:31:55.250,1:32:03.560
Championship so he's ground to make up

1:31:58.840,1:32:06.469
Nick McCrory in 11th place looks a

1:32:03.560,1:32:08.810
lonely figure up at the top of that 10

1:32:06.469,1:32:11.810
meter ball just over 39 feet

1:32:08.810,1:32:15.739
you know money back three and a half

1:32:11.810,1:32:23.030
somersault now for Nick McCrory from the

1:32:15.739,1:32:25.250
states very good seventy nine point two

1:32:23.030,1:32:30.440
for the dive last night brings a smile

1:32:25.250,1:32:32.330
to the US coaching staff great height

1:32:30.440,1:32:34.310
off the platform so he's already threw

1:32:32.330,1:32:38.780
his first somersault before he passes it

1:32:34.310,1:32:41.270
on the way down give yourself time to

1:32:38.780,1:32:46.730
get the entry angle just right which he

1:32:41.270,1:32:48.890
did started off as a swimmer and said

1:32:46.730,1:32:50.360
that to switch to diving because he

1:32:48.890,1:32:53.060
looked more fun having a bit more fun

1:32:50.360,1:32:54.710
with those scores I mean it's just

1:32:53.060,1:32:57.530
watching that line in the pool hour

1:32:54.710,1:33:01.060
after hour lap after lap how much fun is

1:32:57.530,1:33:03.980
that why don't you jump off ten meters

1:33:01.060,1:33:07.310
Alexander Banda with a reverse three and

1:33:03.980,1:33:10.449
a half somersault thirteenth he's still

1:33:07.310,1:33:10.449
full of hope here

1:33:12.060,1:33:20.260
well well that's one of the best entries

1:33:15.520,1:33:22.530
of the night the dive got in 89.1 last

1:33:20.260,1:33:22.530
night

1:33:28.490,1:33:32.810
he's a little sort of vibration of the

1:33:31.040,1:33:37.430
hips and legs here as he straightened

1:33:32.810,1:33:39.260
out for the entry too quick for the

1:33:37.430,1:33:44.050
judges to worry about that though and on

1:33:39.260,1:33:47.450
89.1 and bond or he's going well I just

1:33:44.050,1:33:50.890
cashed in there his countryman Sakharov

1:33:47.450,1:33:50.890
I think you had the disappointing dive

1:33:53.560,1:34:01.580
now we're getting back up more towards

1:33:56.780,1:34:06.380
the top end with even Garcia from

1:34:01.580,1:34:08.240
Mexico's sixth place after four dives

1:34:06.380,1:34:19.130
now a reverse three and a half

1:34:08.240,1:34:22.870
somersault tucked qualified sixth

1:34:19.130,1:34:22.870
sitting sixth at the moment

1:34:33.380,1:34:40.550
almost had too much time he's so quick

1:34:36.080,1:34:46.050
with his somersaults so he's just

1:34:40.550,1:34:47.670
overcooked it at the end well let's go

1:34:46.050,1:34:50.520
one and a half done by the time it goes

1:34:47.670,1:34:53.460
past the platform and spotted the water

1:34:50.520,1:34:57.630
so early he pushed himself past the

1:34:53.460,1:34:59.760
vertical but as he comes out of the

1:34:57.630,1:35:02.880
split tuck ankles together there's lots

1:34:59.760,1:35:06.600
to like about that dive seventy four to

1:35:02.880,1:35:08.220
five the difficulty was three three just

1:35:06.600,1:35:10.200
a reminder that all these divers not had

1:35:08.220,1:35:12.510
not only had to qualify from last night

1:35:10.200,1:35:14.490
but just to be in London now they did

1:35:12.510,1:35:17.550
well in last year's World Championships

1:35:14.490,1:35:20.070
or were continental champions or through

1:35:17.550,1:35:22.280
the diving World Cup this year which

1:35:20.070,1:35:24.540
carries on around the world

1:35:22.280,1:35:33.020
chairman Sanchez reversed three and a

1:35:24.540,1:35:33.020
half somersault with work to do again

1:35:38.270,1:35:43.910
well that's a very good dive

1:35:44.370,1:35:49.059
[Applause]

1:35:46.329,1:35:49.889
he's entitled to like this one up and

1:35:49.059,1:35:52.449
away

1:35:49.889,1:35:57.929
not too close to the platform to give us

1:35:52.449,1:36:01.840
any palpitations slight twist of this

1:35:57.929,1:36:05.739
angle of entry here vertical if not

1:36:01.840,1:36:08.079
square the judges didn't seem to mind

1:36:05.739,1:36:10.989
three 9s there and an eighty nine point

1:36:08.079,1:36:12.969
one again that's the kind of error Roger

1:36:10.989,1:36:15.099
what we we need a couple of angles to

1:36:12.969,1:36:21.369
pick that up on right back on track

1:36:15.099,1:36:23.710
after that Martin Wolfram from Germany

1:36:21.369,1:36:25.239
and twenty-year-old from Dresden back

1:36:23.710,1:36:31.530
two and a half somersault two and a half

1:36:25.239,1:36:31.530
twist fifth after four dives

1:36:36.640,1:36:42.920
yeah it looked like it was going to be

1:36:39.770,1:36:44.870
untidy at entry that fits into me all

1:36:42.920,1:36:46.730
over the place but he's again controlled

1:36:44.870,1:36:50.410
the splash very well good push off the

1:36:46.730,1:36:56.140
platform through this complicated dive

1:36:50.410,1:36:56.140
finds the water hmm

1:36:56.650,1:37:02.360
good but he's got better remember at the

1:37:00.350,1:37:04.250
World Championships last year he didn't

1:37:02.360,1:37:08.500
even get through qualifying finished

1:37:04.250,1:37:08.500
20th so he's really trained on here

1:37:09.430,1:37:24.110
86 for Sascha Klein completing the

1:37:20.750,1:37:25.940
encouraging position for Germany was a

1:37:24.110,1:37:33.280
reverse three and a half somersault for

1:37:25.940,1:37:36.140
his fifth dive was ranked fourth and he

1:37:33.280,1:37:40.130
received an eighty nine point one for

1:37:36.140,1:37:43.280
this dive last night but that was

1:37:40.130,1:37:49.090
scoring nines so you won't get that this

1:37:43.280,1:37:49.090
time with a three point three tariff

1:37:49.450,1:37:55.660
this grimacing through those tight

1:37:52.940,1:37:55.660
rotations

1:37:58.239,1:38:08.969
seventy four to five so 15 points

1:38:01.360,1:38:13.780
slipped there at the top of the board

1:38:08.969,1:38:16.239
having a good competition for number one

1:38:13.780,1:38:17.950
ranking tonight with Kubo this is linen

1:38:16.239,1:38:22.080
at you a will that I understand back

1:38:17.950,1:38:22.080
double somersault two and a half twist

1:38:23.880,1:38:27.310
well that's his biggest splash of the

1:38:26.830,1:38:29.890
night

1:38:27.310,1:38:32.380
well the morning at least sorry and that

1:38:29.890,1:38:36.430
that dive that got him ninety one point

1:38:32.380,1:38:38.950
eight in the prelims won't be doing so

1:38:36.430,1:38:41.320
again he got off on the wrong angle

1:38:38.950,1:38:46.960
there when arms was stronger in the

1:38:41.320,1:38:52.540
push-off than the other never had it

1:38:46.960,1:38:54.670
online and he's dominated the syncro

1:38:52.540,1:38:57.160
seen over the last few years the

1:38:54.670,1:39:00.880
reigning Olympic champions ten metre

1:38:57.160,1:39:03.550
synchro World Championships in 2007 and

1:39:00.880,1:39:07.239
nine but to bow has hugged the

1:39:03.550,1:39:09.340
individual limelight now if he gets this

1:39:07.239,1:39:11.950
it's a 100-point dive it's his toughest

1:39:09.340,1:39:15.450
Tara three point seven forward

1:39:11.950,1:39:15.450
four-and-a-half somersault tucked

1:39:17.170,1:39:23.170
now quiet he's short on the entry so

1:39:20.949,1:39:26.050
he's just showing the rest of the field

1:39:23.170,1:39:28.239
that he can make mistakes very high

1:39:26.050,1:39:31.360
tariffs dive though so he's got to score

1:39:28.239,1:39:34.989
well mistake about that but the hips

1:39:31.360,1:39:38.860
still bent at entry and it doesn't

1:39:34.989,1:39:41.020
matter that it's chuubo the judges have

1:39:38.860,1:39:42.340
to be totally objective which they have

1:39:41.020,1:39:45.730
been here they've seen that mistake

1:39:42.340,1:39:48.280
ninety four thirty five is still a good

1:39:45.730,1:39:50.590
score but five less than for the same

1:39:48.280,1:39:52.000
guy last night it's a bit like competing

1:39:50.590,1:39:53.590
against some of the Kenyans on the track

1:39:52.000,1:39:56.260
you've got to believe that you can win

1:39:53.590,1:39:58.840
it and not just take it for granted

1:39:56.260,1:40:01.630
they're still top of the pile to Beau

1:39:58.840,1:40:03.850
and Lynn you a David butai but look Tom

1:40:01.630,1:40:06.730
Daley up into fourth that's what's

1:40:03.850,1:40:08.860
getting the crowd cheering here Thomas

1:40:06.730,1:40:11.350
Martin wolfram and Sasha Klein from

1:40:08.860,1:40:14.980
Germany still holding their own Matthew

1:40:11.350,1:40:17.020
Mitchum the right side of the line Jose

1:40:14.980,1:40:20.290
Guerra and the man really under pressure

1:40:17.020,1:40:23.619
is Riley McCormick no German sanchez has

1:40:20.290,1:40:25.780
seen his program fall away dramatically

1:40:23.619,1:40:27.699
and really rather surprisingly yes that

1:40:25.780,1:40:30.489
the Mexican competitors qualified fifth

1:40:27.699,1:40:32.530
and sixth but it could be only one of

1:40:30.489,1:40:35.469
them will make it through on those

1:40:32.530,1:40:38.050
positions and we have to keep an eye on

1:40:35.469,1:40:39.880
Matthew Mitchell's last dive too I was

1:40:38.050,1:40:43.510
riding him into the final two early he's

1:40:39.880,1:40:46.710
under some pressure inside the 12 at the

1:40:43.510,1:40:46.710
moment but only just

1:40:49.300,1:40:55.340
sixth and final series have died these

1:40:52.639,1:40:58.429
divers have been competing now for about

1:40:55.340,1:41:01.790
an hour and 37 minutes to get through

1:40:58.429,1:41:03.800
five dives organizers have got the

1:41:01.790,1:41:07.280
competition moving along as swiftly as

1:41:03.800,1:41:10.610
possible and now it's the American from

1:41:07.280,1:41:15.099
Abilene Texas the 23 year old and the

1:41:10.610,1:41:17.300
bronze synchro medallist third after

1:41:15.099,1:41:19.489
five rounds back two and a half

1:41:17.300,1:41:22.540
somersault two and a half twists in

1:41:19.489,1:41:25.250
there as well and that man is safe

1:41:22.540,1:41:27.020
stumbled into the semi-final in last

1:41:25.250,1:41:29.179
position but he's going to be much

1:41:27.020,1:41:35.000
higher up the rankings where we're

1:41:29.179,1:41:37.610
expecting to see him and in contention

1:41:35.000,1:41:39.969
tonight you have to say when he's diving

1:41:37.610,1:41:50.599
now according to his reputation and his

1:41:39.969,1:41:53.480
results very strong man great core

1:41:50.599,1:41:59.719
strength five foot nine one of the

1:41:53.480,1:42:03.020
taller divers on show here and then

1:41:59.719,1:42:05.739
ninety three point six very consistent

1:42:03.020,1:42:09.739
session his head that's his highest dive

1:42:05.739,1:42:14.360
good finish you like that because a

1:42:09.739,1:42:16.880
guerra 12th back two and a half

1:42:14.360,1:42:20.889
somersault two and a half twists diving

1:42:16.880,1:42:20.889
for a place in the final tonight

1:42:24.270,1:42:31.520
might just have done it too

1:42:26.490,1:42:36.260
[Applause]

1:42:31.520,1:42:38.019
three point six the tariff through the

1:42:36.260,1:42:40.119
twists

1:42:38.019,1:42:47.739
into the water at a good angle low

1:42:40.119,1:42:50.679
splash it's given the judges something

1:42:47.739,1:42:55.380
to admire a coach looks a little

1:42:50.679,1:42:59.380
concerned but he's the 33 year old

1:42:55.380,1:43:02.260
remember the real standard bearer for

1:42:59.380,1:43:06.730
diving in Cuba and the oldest diver in

1:43:02.260,1:43:09.969
the competition declared galperin and 27

1:43:06.730,1:43:12.099
year old from Moscow trying to put all

1:43:09.969,1:43:14.019
those injury problems of the past behind

1:43:12.099,1:43:20.889
him back two and a half somersault to an

1:43:14.019,1:43:24.059
half twist my well be his farewell show

1:43:20.889,1:43:24.059
back down in 16th

1:43:26.409,1:43:31.960
alprin would love to take back his

1:43:29.590,1:43:35.560
second dive which got less than 40

1:43:31.960,1:43:37.440
points an eighty four point six and he

1:43:35.560,1:43:43.870
needs a few things to go right for him

1:43:37.440,1:43:46.210
to make the 12 next up its the local

1:43:43.870,1:43:49.239
hero it's Tom Daley who has been getting

1:43:46.210,1:43:51.880
better and better and will be desperate

1:43:49.239,1:43:54.040
to produce a strong dive to finish his

1:43:51.880,1:43:58.750
program and send him into tonight's

1:43:54.040,1:44:02.409
final with the confidence that he surely

1:43:58.750,1:44:04.600
craves for fourth after five dives

1:44:02.409,1:44:07.330
reverse three and a half somersault with

1:44:04.600,1:44:11.650
a comparatively modest three point three

1:44:07.330,1:44:21.100
degree of difficulty there we are

1:44:11.650,1:44:24.840
he's through hardly a splash at all rips

1:44:21.100,1:44:24.840
through the three and a half somersaults

1:44:25.719,1:44:30.489
he's the man most of the crowd have come

1:44:27.910,1:44:34.330
to see and they are giving him a major

1:44:30.489,1:44:37.030
send-off into tonight's final are the

1:44:34.330,1:44:41.260
judges though that's the all-important

1:44:37.030,1:44:45.760
thing all the applause air cooing around

1:44:41.260,1:44:48.790
this Aquatic Center and an eighty nine

1:44:45.760,1:44:51.010
point one count him in is another man

1:44:48.790,1:44:54.610
confirming his position in the platform

1:44:51.010,1:44:57.430
final very smiley young man apart from

1:44:54.610,1:44:59.199
when the competition is on so he will

1:44:57.430,1:45:02.699
have a little bit more to relax about

1:44:59.199,1:45:06.160
after this morning Victor Mille by

1:45:02.699,1:45:09.340
seventh back 2 & a half somersault two

1:45:06.160,1:45:13.920
and a half twist which you want to make

1:45:09.340,1:45:13.920
sure that he just gets through tidally

1:45:21.140,1:45:25.200
that's good he's in as well

1:45:23.730,1:45:27.360
a long way to fall from seventh to

1:45:25.200,1:45:32.880
thirteen and he could even lift himself

1:45:27.360,1:45:33.360
a place this was very good there's the

1:45:32.880,1:45:35.340
water

1:45:33.360,1:45:37.880
I'm going in straight and he certainly

1:45:35.340,1:45:37.880
does

1:45:40.070,1:45:44.999
whole different level of competition so

1:45:42.329,1:45:47.610
far this morning we're getting far more

1:45:44.999,1:45:48.389
of those ain't the haves and nines bit

1:45:47.610,1:45:50.309
more like it

1:45:48.389,1:45:52.499
and the Russian support crew very happy

1:45:50.309,1:45:57.199
with it that's his higher score of the

1:45:52.499,1:45:57.199
semi ninety three point six so he's in

1:45:57.559,1:46:05.519
Victor Ortega from Colombia right down

1:46:02.760,1:46:07.619
in seventeen film just wanting to walk

1:46:05.519,1:46:11.729
away from the Olympic Games with a good

1:46:07.619,1:46:13.289
dive behind him which he does reverse

1:46:11.729,1:46:17.070
three and a half somersault were three

1:46:13.289,1:46:20.610
point three wonder if that's his last

1:46:17.070,1:46:24.139
dive in Olympic competition he's 24 he's

1:46:20.610,1:46:24.139
got his sights set on being a lawyer

1:46:24.199,1:46:29.849
second Olympic Games it's not a bad

1:46:28.170,1:46:32.820
effort overall in his sporting career as

1:46:29.849,1:46:34.709
it to Olympic Games but from Colombia

1:46:32.820,1:46:37.829
down to Brazil it's not that far is it

1:46:34.709,1:46:38.340
he might just be tempted to go one more

1:46:37.829,1:46:41.059
cycle

1:46:38.340,1:46:43.199
I wonder it'll be his decision of course

1:46:41.059,1:46:45.959
seventy nine point two well done

1:46:43.199,1:46:47.969
training so demanding though trying to

1:46:45.959,1:46:51.449
carry two careers and compete at the

1:46:47.969,1:46:57.599
very highest level that's tough and torn

1:46:51.449,1:47:00.119
zakharov now in 15th place he collapsed

1:46:57.599,1:47:03.179
in his program a little bit back two and

1:47:00.119,1:47:05.610
a half somersault two and a half twists

1:47:03.179,1:47:12.390
well he's a little bit of a chance here

1:47:05.610,1:47:14.670
with a 3.6 tariff on this one this is

1:47:12.390,1:47:18.659
going to be very tight pressure on

1:47:14.670,1:47:25.170
around the cut and as the eight and a

1:47:18.659,1:47:26.969
half's come in for zakharov and judge is

1:47:25.170,1:47:32.429
thrown in a nine and a half year

1:47:26.969,1:47:34.230
I'm sure where that comes from oh no I'm

1:47:32.429,1:47:37.429
bigger pardon he'll have an anxious

1:47:34.230,1:47:37.429
fifteen twenty minutes

1:47:38.030,1:47:50.330
Riley McCormick from Canada 13th diving

1:47:45.179,1:47:53.429
to give Canada a representative in the

1:47:50.330,1:48:02.159
concluding event in the pool tonight

1:47:53.429,1:48:05.340
back three and a half somersault I need

1:48:02.159,1:48:12.330
pressure on this dive one outside the

1:48:05.340,1:48:14.969
top 12 or spectacularly good high

1:48:12.330,1:48:16.920
tariffs with this one was his best dive

1:48:14.969,1:48:22.770
last night he obviously likes this one

1:48:16.920,1:48:24.420
he saves his best till last Canada have

1:48:22.770,1:48:26.100
picked up two bronze in these Olympic

1:48:24.420,1:48:27.810
Games in the diving and they they'll

1:48:26.100,1:48:30.630
want to be here competing tonight John

1:48:27.810,1:48:37.469
not just as spectators boy he might have

1:48:30.630,1:48:45.420
done it big sprinkling of nines across

1:48:37.469,1:48:47.670
the scoreboard for him only applaud the

1:48:45.420,1:48:50.460
work of his opponent here ninety seven

1:48:47.670,1:48:53.670
point two well that's one of the top

1:48:50.460,1:48:57.270
dives of the night talk about digging

1:48:53.670,1:49:01.920
deep when it's necessary hi Claire oak

1:48:57.270,1:49:03.780
wheeler is bringing out the ball of the

1:49:01.920,1:49:06.570
table at the moments back two and a half

1:49:03.780,1:49:10.489
somersault two and a half twist to end

1:49:06.570,1:49:10.489
his Olympic campaign

1:49:13.830,1:49:19.660
better finish from him disappointing

1:49:16.900,1:49:22.260
considering he came in as the tenth

1:49:19.660,1:49:22.260
qualifier

1:49:27.760,1:49:34.890
didn't make the final in Beijing and

1:49:30.030,1:49:38.699
again it's a semi final ranking for him

1:49:34.890,1:49:38.699
top 18 in the world

1:49:40.830,1:49:44.629
[Music]

1:49:42.589,1:49:46.939
now there's a lot of pressure on this

1:49:44.629,1:49:50.539
dive for Matthew Mitchum who's coming in

1:49:46.939,1:49:52.639
to his last dive ranked 11th but those

1:49:50.539,1:49:55.669
around him are really finding extra

1:49:52.639,1:49:58.699
points with the last dive the Olympic

1:49:55.669,1:50:02.119
champion wants the chance to defend that

1:49:58.699,1:50:05.569
title tonight and cannot afford anything

1:50:02.119,1:50:10.159
less than his best now it's his highest

1:50:05.569,1:50:17.510
taraf dive back to a half somersault two

1:50:10.159,1:50:22.760
and a half twist oh I don't know I don't

1:50:17.510,1:50:25.609
know some concern faces amongst those

1:50:22.760,1:50:32.839
interested in his outcome this was a big

1:50:25.609,1:50:35.599
splash looked to be struggling and I

1:50:32.839,1:50:38.719
think we've just lost him these scores

1:50:35.599,1:50:40.519
aren't enough and that will be a loss to

1:50:38.719,1:50:42.800
tonight's final he was still one of the

1:50:40.519,1:50:44.689
big names being mentioned in the metal

1:50:42.800,1:50:47.329
frame coming into this competition and

1:50:44.689,1:50:50.739
it will be a real shock and a real story

1:50:47.329,1:50:54.349
if Matthew Mitchum has missed that cut

1:50:50.739,1:50:55.760
and he is flirting with it on those

1:50:54.349,1:50:58.789
marks Steve

1:50:55.760,1:51:00.229
well that's 70.2 is his lowest scoring

1:50:58.789,1:51:05.149
dive of the night and had the highest

1:51:00.229,1:51:08.149
tariff so I should say morning again the

1:51:05.149,1:51:12.499
man who produced of the end dive to end

1:51:08.149,1:51:14.089
all endives four years ago is suffering

1:51:12.499,1:51:16.249
the opposite now nick McCrory's got his

1:51:14.089,1:51:18.579
own worries he's tenth back two and a

1:51:16.249,1:51:22.310
half somersault two and a half twists

1:51:18.579,1:51:31.070
needs a steady points return

1:51:22.310,1:51:34.580
I think that was steady enough push off

1:51:31.070,1:51:37.100
the platform one of the taller divers

1:51:34.580,1:51:40.280
here 511 it's a lot of body to get

1:51:37.100,1:51:46.760
around and up into the air but he does

1:51:40.280,1:51:52.700
it very efficiently and he should be

1:51:46.760,1:51:54.230
okay in fact he will be look at the

1:51:52.700,1:51:55.480
number of competitors left and where he

1:51:54.230,1:52:00.440
sits

1:51:55.480,1:52:03.110
McCrory's in alexander bond our ninth

1:52:00.440,1:52:07.220
after five dives back two and a half

1:52:03.110,1:52:09.640
somersault two and a half twist looking

1:52:07.220,1:52:09.640
over his shoulder

1:52:16.840,1:52:24.840
very nice entry bond or

1:52:22.920,1:52:26.220
well there is the disappointment of

1:52:24.840,1:52:31.110
Matthew Mitchum I think he knows he's

1:52:26.220,1:52:35.700
gone tearful into his campaign that leg

1:52:31.110,1:52:39.420
form here bond are not so special and

1:52:35.700,1:52:42.480
seventy nine point two one of his lower

1:52:39.420,1:52:45.650
rank dies for the session but he's okay

1:52:42.480,1:52:45.650
he's qualified

1:52:51.070,1:52:56.150
on our little scoreboard here up in our

1:52:53.660,1:52:58.250
commentary position as its confirmed who

1:52:56.150,1:53:00.850
can't be displaced a little Q is coming

1:52:58.250,1:53:04.700
up next to their name but Mitchum knows

1:53:00.850,1:53:09.080
it's there's no final for him even

1:53:04.700,1:53:11.030
Garcia H finishing with a four with two

1:53:09.080,1:53:15.650
and a half somersault with three twists

1:53:11.030,1:53:18.110
with a three point eight tariff didn't

1:53:15.650,1:53:20.300
finish it as he would have liked it came

1:53:18.110,1:53:24.320
down pretty quickly as he looked to get

1:53:20.300,1:53:28.810
into the twisting section of his dive

1:53:24.320,1:53:28.810
and over the leaks come

1:53:36.489,1:53:39.780
what you doing those

1:53:43.830,1:53:57.250
and a seventy nine point eight so he's

1:53:51.460,1:53:57.790
in it's been a strange session note for

1:53:57.250,1:54:00.310
this man

1:53:57.790,1:54:02.860
German Sanchez who was looking very

1:54:00.310,1:54:05.650
impressive at one stage but he's fallen

1:54:02.860,1:54:07.450
away he's packed down in 14th forward

1:54:05.650,1:54:15.790
four and a half somersault three point

1:54:07.450,1:54:18.070
seven needs a big haul from that twenty

1:54:15.790,1:54:19.780
year old from Guadalajara silver

1:54:18.070,1:54:23.200
medalist in the synchro with event

1:54:19.780,1:54:24.840
Garcia does not want to be split from

1:54:23.200,1:54:29.200
his countryman for tonight

1:54:24.840,1:54:31.390
this was his lowest scoring dive in the

1:54:29.200,1:54:34.960
prelims and I think he's making amends

1:54:31.390,1:54:41.350
here II only got sixes for it last night

1:54:34.960,1:54:44.950
but today some eights and a good tariff

1:54:41.350,1:54:47.190
of three seven and an eighty eight point

1:54:44.950,1:54:47.190
eight

1:54:53.909,1:55:01.239
he's waiting hmm

1:54:56.260,1:55:05.170
Martin Wolfram in fifth place forward

1:55:01.239,1:55:10.570
four and a half somersault to end three

1:55:05.170,1:55:13.780
point seven a tariff very nice a little

1:55:10.570,1:55:17.250
short on the entry not much

1:55:13.780,1:55:17.250
and a big tariff

1:55:21.390,1:55:26.910
he's have a good competition so far

1:55:23.520,1:55:29.070
though responding to the challenge of

1:55:26.910,1:55:33.770
this the very highest level of

1:55:29.070,1:55:33.770
competition which is pretty new to him

1:55:37.060,1:55:45.180
who dire daily wolfram Mina by of

1:55:39.760,1:55:48.070
mccrory Guerra Garcia Navarro bondar

1:55:45.180,1:55:52.060
McCormick they're all in

1:55:48.070,1:55:53.920
Sascha Klein in sixth place we're also

1:55:52.060,1:55:56.290
looking to be joining the party and

1:55:53.920,1:55:57.910
should do my selling disastrous happens

1:55:56.290,1:56:02.740
to his back two and a half somersault

1:55:57.910,1:56:03.550
two and a half twists he's been

1:56:02.740,1:56:05.770
consistent

1:56:03.550,1:56:08.260
well no disaster there but not quite

1:56:05.770,1:56:12.000
what he would like to show us in the

1:56:08.260,1:56:12.000
final but he'll be there

1:56:21.790,1:56:27.530
the judge is very much of a same view

1:56:24.290,1:56:32.679
about this dive which gotta make t1 in

1:56:27.530,1:56:32.679
the prelims and again

1:56:32.869,1:56:35.860
nothing if not consistent

1:56:37.019,1:56:45.360
now the battle within the battle Lin you

1:56:40.019,1:56:46.499
a from China second behind his

1:56:45.360,1:56:49.139
countrymen back two and a half

1:56:46.499,1:56:54.469
somersault two and a half twists to

1:56:49.139,1:56:54.469
conclude an impressive program

1:56:56.480,1:57:01.559
well impressive again Lin you a there

1:56:59.849,1:57:03.780
was a little bit of a leg form break at

1:57:01.559,1:57:08.429
the top of the dive but he got it all

1:57:03.780,1:57:11.789
back together very neatly just there the

1:57:08.429,1:57:13.980
ankles drifted apart but restores his

1:57:11.789,1:57:16.280
usual immaculate position as he enters

1:57:13.980,1:57:16.280
the water

1:57:22.869,1:57:29.739
so will it be China one too going into

1:57:26.980,1:57:33.849
the final these scores don't carry

1:57:29.739,1:57:35.889
forward of course Roger may well carry

1:57:33.849,1:57:39.550
forward in one or two divers mines as

1:57:35.889,1:57:42.909
they say the standards that the Chinese

1:57:39.550,1:57:47.440
divers have set not that it comes as any

1:57:42.909,1:57:49.480
surprise at all and leading the field

1:57:47.440,1:57:54.520
has been nineteen-year-old

1:57:49.480,1:57:57.900
cubo the bookies favourite back two and

1:57:54.520,1:57:57.900
a half somersault two and a half twist

1:57:58.380,1:58:04.750
well why not end the session with

1:58:00.880,1:58:09.130
something near perfection to boat could

1:58:04.750,1:58:12.909
give us another 100 point dive here such

1:58:09.130,1:58:17.610
power off the platform and through the

1:58:12.909,1:58:21.760
rotations diver of the Year for the

1:58:17.610,1:58:25.030
governing body FINA last year and

1:58:21.760,1:58:26.500
another tantalizing display from him

1:58:25.030,1:58:28.840
gonna be great tonight

1:58:26.500,1:58:33.610
well very close to the hundred ninety

1:58:28.840,1:58:35.770
seven point two he's the top man he is

1:58:33.610,1:58:39.130
the one to beat they are the ones to be

1:58:35.770,1:58:41.739
the two Chinese divers Tom Daly getting

1:58:39.130,1:58:45.130
a massive cheer as he leaves the pool

1:58:41.739,1:58:49.869
fourth place Matthew Mitchum though he

1:58:45.130,1:58:51.790
will be devastated he has just missed

1:58:49.869,1:58:54.300
out by one spot Matthew Mitch and no

1:58:51.790,1:58:57.550
opportunity to defend his Olympic title

1:58:54.300,1:58:59.230
so there's one that the rest of the

1:58:57.550,1:59:00.909
field does not have to worry about and

1:58:59.230,1:59:01.510
he could have been a threat but he

1:59:00.909,1:59:03.310
didn't make it

1:59:01.510,1:59:05.340
David Buddha's come out of this from

1:59:03.310,1:59:08.139
18th up to third

1:59:05.340,1:59:10.630
Martin Wolfram just behind Tom Daley

1:59:08.139,1:59:13.630
their mini buy of a quarry sasha klein

1:59:10.630,1:59:19.599
germany doing well for sake we're up

1:59:13.630,1:59:22.420
making the cuts even Garcia Aleksandr

1:59:19.599,1:59:24.820
Banda Rowley McCormick scrambling aboard

1:59:22.420,1:59:27.130
the big headline to miss out Matthew

1:59:24.820,1:59:29.889
Mitchell and German Sanchez as well who

1:59:27.130,1:59:31.960
was so promising before also misses the

1:59:29.889,1:59:34.510
boat glib galperin to will be

1:59:31.960,1:59:36.890
disappointed as will those six who don't

1:59:34.510,1:59:39.410
go forward but Matthew Mitchum

1:59:36.890,1:59:41.900
the negative headline story if you like

1:59:39.410,1:59:43.970
from tonight and I'll save you any

1:59:41.900,1:59:45.740
accusations and buyers to say that from

1:59:43.970,1:59:48.320
an impartial point of view the

1:59:45.740,1:59:51.440
competition will be a little bit the

1:59:48.320,1:59:58.310
less for the for the lack of someone

1:59:51.440,2:00:00.230
like him so he can't really have any

1:59:58.310,2:00:03.530
complaints Roger he missed that that

2:00:00.230,2:00:05.750
12th position by some 13 points we know

2:00:03.530,2:00:07.940
he's come here less than in the

2:00:05.750,2:00:09.770
condition he was four years ago not able

2:00:07.940,2:00:11.570
to throw the difficulty into some dives

2:00:09.770,2:00:14.330
but he didn't finish well he had the

2:00:11.570,2:00:15.980
opportunity to confirm his place wasn't

2:00:14.330,2:00:19.370
able to make the most of that last dive

2:00:15.980,2:00:22.190
that had the highest tariffs and so paid

2:00:19.370,2:00:24.230
the price here and we can have he can

2:00:22.190,2:00:27.650
have no complaints he knew what his

2:00:24.230,2:00:29.360
limitations were coming here and as much

2:00:27.650,2:00:31.460
as we like watching him dive I think if

2:00:29.360,2:00:33.110
he'd made the twelve in the form that

2:00:31.460,2:00:35.450
we've seen from him he wasn't going to

2:00:33.110,2:00:37.460
threaten for the Middle's his

2:00:35.450,2:00:39.260
personality though is something that

2:00:37.460,2:00:42.260
adds to the whole sense of occasion here

2:00:39.260,2:00:45.080
mind you this competition so far

2:00:42.260,2:00:47.450
today has really cranked up the

2:00:45.080,2:00:50.030
anticipation and Tom Daley's progress

2:00:47.450,2:00:52.370
will certainly crank up the volume

2:00:50.030,2:00:55.190
there'll be 17,000 in here tonight it is

2:00:52.370,2:00:58.610
one of the top tickets in town if you

2:00:55.190,2:01:00.620
were lucky enough to get it and really

2:00:58.610,2:01:04.970
the the level of competition has risen

2:01:00.620,2:01:07.370
here because it was it was fierce

2:01:04.970,2:01:09.530
especially for that last place on board

2:01:07.370,2:01:11.570
and we've got an idea of what is to come

2:01:09.530,2:01:14.030
tonight it's gonna be a great

2:01:11.570,2:01:15.140
competition the crowd will lift the roof

2:01:14.030,2:01:17.510
off for Tom Daley

2:01:15.140,2:01:19.670
there'll be generous applause and real

2:01:17.510,2:01:21.800
excitement about what the two top

2:01:19.670,2:01:26.060
Chinese competitors have for a to bow

2:01:21.800,2:01:29.540
and linear and whaddaya coming from last

2:01:26.060,2:01:32.030
qualifying position to third maybe he's

2:01:29.540,2:01:35.960
got more to offer as well but so much to

2:01:32.030,2:01:39.770
look forward to Roger so can anyone

2:01:35.960,2:01:41.860
produce the performances to challenge

2:01:39.770,2:01:44.139
these Chinese divers who

2:01:41.860,2:01:48.369
I have shown their nerve and their skill

2:01:44.139,2:01:50.889
their impassive on the outside and they

2:01:48.369,2:01:53.230
