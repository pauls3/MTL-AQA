0:00:00.000,0:00:04.500
two rounds of diving to come and this is

0:00:02.250,0:00:06.480
how it stands as we head into the final

0:00:04.500,0:00:08.250
stage of this competition Tonya couch

0:00:06.480,0:00:10.650
leads still for Great Britain with a

0:00:08.250,0:00:12.540
really good score but it's the second

0:00:10.650,0:00:15.120
page where all the action is because the

0:00:12.540,0:00:17.430
top 12 of 20 go through to the final in

0:00:15.120,0:00:19.170
this men women's 10 metre platform and

0:00:17.430,0:00:21.570
at the moment it's Green anger gamma of

0:00:19.170,0:00:30.840
Lithuania that has dived herself into a

0:00:21.570,0:00:35.460
qualification zone Germany's Christina

0:00:30.840,0:00:39.510
arson great start and a little wobble

0:00:35.460,0:00:41.190
then a brilliant comeback so the 16 year

0:00:39.510,0:00:42.809
old looking good for a place in the

0:00:41.190,0:00:49.379
final for three and a half then for

0:00:42.809,0:00:51.449
Round four it's a lot of rotation in the

0:00:49.379,0:00:52.829
pike position and you it she had to

0:00:51.449,0:00:54.920
leave this dive spinning a bit longer

0:00:52.829,0:00:58.140
than she wants hit and ran out of room

0:00:54.920,0:01:00.210
classic mistake jumps forward but here

0:00:58.140,0:01:02.940
she pulls in and suddenly it picks up

0:01:00.210,0:01:10.439
the rotation and she was surprised by it

0:01:02.940,0:01:13.619
and came out to Lane 49 500 sat in one

0:01:10.439,0:01:15.150
of those rotating off his chairs put

0:01:13.619,0:01:16.770
your arms and legs out and rotate it

0:01:15.150,0:01:18.360
you'll go around quite slowly and what

0:01:16.770,0:01:20.189
you're doing that then put your arms and

0:01:18.360,0:01:22.080
legs in fast and watch your increased

0:01:20.189,0:01:25.409
rotation and that's basically the

0:01:22.080,0:01:27.270
physics that are working here by the way

0:01:25.409,0:01:33.180
don't hurt yourself while you're doing

0:01:27.270,0:01:35.430
it but you Cove up needs a recovery dive

0:01:33.180,0:01:42.560
here arm stand forward two somersaults

0:01:35.430,0:01:42.560
single twist lovely understand

0:01:43.369,0:01:48.710
that's a classy dive from start to

0:01:46.280,0:01:51.530
finish I like to start their hips

0:01:48.710,0:01:55.039
forward flick off and then the twist and

0:01:51.530,0:01:56.689
then the line up if she bends her arms

0:01:55.039,0:01:59.750
that's the right way to go just a little

0:01:56.689,0:02:03.069
bit low though with the head I'm past

0:01:59.750,0:02:04.789
the board at the entry that's important

0:02:03.069,0:02:06.500
into the 60s

0:02:04.789,0:02:14.269
perchik over should climb a couple of

0:02:06.500,0:02:18.079
places with that one geography like

0:02:14.269,0:02:20.299
Amish then talked about this twister for

0:02:18.079,0:02:22.430
her during the course of the competition

0:02:20.299,0:02:24.380
is this the dive that he's going to be a

0:02:22.430,0:02:28.670
problem because she has a lot of heavy

0:02:24.380,0:02:29.480
black tape around her neck let me so put

0:02:28.670,0:02:32.319
the head under pressure

0:02:29.480,0:02:33.709
oh it's kept the head in place

0:02:32.319,0:02:37.730
beautifully done

0:02:33.709,0:02:39.769
yeah no wobble at all that's a brilliant

0:02:37.730,0:02:41.750
twist that's the way to do it a slight

0:02:39.769,0:02:43.610
over twist going through the water I

0:02:41.750,0:02:45.019
think because the dive is so pretty

0:02:43.610,0:02:52.239
they're not on the mark too many points

0:02:45.019,0:02:57.709
off might just keep it under 60 57 400

0:02:52.239,0:02:59.690
little core mas okay that's good I think

0:02:57.709,0:03:02.209
should maintain her qualification

0:02:59.690,0:03:03.920
position with one round to go no

0:03:02.209,0:03:06.380
problems so far though in terms of

0:03:03.920,0:03:11.630
qualification for Great Britain's Tonya

0:03:06.380,0:03:13.669
couch first position for the last couple

0:03:11.630,0:03:15.019
of rounds back two and half somersaults

0:03:13.669,0:03:16.940
one and a half twists in the pike

0:03:15.019,0:03:24.769
position then for Tonya in round four at

0:03:16.940,0:03:26.900
3.2 will most definitely be a medal

0:03:24.769,0:03:29.180
contender come deceive me because she is

0:03:26.900,0:03:31.579
gonna be in the final yeah very strong

0:03:29.180,0:03:35.470
takeoff just a little loose with the

0:03:31.579,0:03:40.150
legs going through the water good twist

0:03:35.470,0:03:40.150
reasonably strong Paul in on the Mike

0:03:40.170,0:03:45.319
[Applause]

0:03:42.250,0:03:47.450
loving this all the schoolchildren in

0:03:45.319,0:03:49.160
for this afternoon's session enjoying

0:03:47.450,0:03:51.469
the fact that couch keeps getting the

0:03:49.160,0:03:54.260
scores that keep putting number one

0:03:51.469,0:03:58.700
beside her name and that's what the fans

0:03:54.260,0:04:00.650
are enjoying now Christina shesh Gert

0:03:58.700,0:04:02.750
doesn't look like she's enjoyed her

0:04:00.650,0:04:05.360
competition I'm afraid the young Belarus

0:04:02.750,0:04:07.819
diver back three and a half somersaults

0:04:05.360,0:04:11.269
in the tuck position this is a big dive

0:04:07.819,0:04:13.640
this is joint most difficult dive in the

0:04:11.269,0:04:16.039
competition and the way she's been

0:04:13.640,0:04:19.010
diving Chris you don't hold out much

0:04:16.039,0:04:20.810
hope really now Georgia Ward did the

0:04:19.010,0:04:23.380
back three and a half and went short on

0:04:20.810,0:04:23.380
the entry

0:04:32.199,0:04:39.310
oh well she just about got there well

0:04:35.259,0:04:41.379
done and I was a real struggle the heads

0:04:39.310,0:04:47.259
in the wrong position is spinning slow

0:04:41.379,0:04:50.340
and are very untidy as she kicks out and

0:04:47.259,0:04:53.740
the huge twister in the water

0:04:50.340,0:04:55.659
forty four five five I think the fact

0:04:53.740,0:04:57.939
that she's safely down more important

0:04:55.659,0:05:00.389
but shesh get won't be heading to the

0:04:57.939,0:05:00.389
final

0:05:00.460,0:05:06.020
it's a fear writing year if she wants to

0:05:03.140,0:05:09.080
go to a European Championship final here

0:05:06.020,0:05:11.540
in London then she has to hit this dive

0:05:09.080,0:05:14.930
and she has to hit her final round dive

0:05:11.540,0:05:18.140
as well both at 2.84 verse two and a

0:05:14.930,0:05:20.380
half she's 35 points out of twelfth

0:05:18.140,0:05:20.380
place

0:05:24.700,0:05:31.080
No and that is probably it I'm afraid

0:05:27.550,0:05:34.030
for Sofia for today that's a poor dive

0:05:31.080,0:05:36.250
jumps forward she feels slow in the spin

0:05:34.030,0:05:39.700
so she's over compensated by staying the

0:05:36.250,0:05:41.890
Tuck longer also she has a problem

0:05:39.700,0:05:44.810
spotting on this knife she doesn't see

0:05:41.890,0:05:47.169
the water before kicking out

0:05:44.810,0:05:49.900
[Music]

0:05:47.169,0:05:52.590
fairly passive response at the moment

0:05:49.900,0:05:55.509
but she will be very disappointed

0:05:52.590,0:05:57.370
expected to see Sofia in the final but

0:05:55.509,0:06:00.490
not happening I'm afraid for the 26 year

0:05:57.370,0:06:02.139
old Hungarian arm stand back to

0:06:00.490,0:06:03.520
somersaults with one and a half twist

0:06:02.139,0:06:06.189
then for Laura Marano

0:06:03.520,0:06:09.219
of France she finishes with two twisting

0:06:06.189,0:06:13.110
dives both at 3.2 and she is on her way

0:06:09.219,0:06:13.110
at the moment to the final

0:06:27.120,0:06:30.200
good position

0:06:31.769,0:06:35.069
yeah good dive from Murano so that'll be

0:06:34.509,0:06:39.129
fine

0:06:35.069,0:06:41.829
she gets to jump off the platform yeah

0:06:39.129,0:06:44.169
good jump just a little and sighs being

0:06:41.829,0:06:45.789
scrappy with her feet though they're the

0:06:44.169,0:06:54.459
feet apart and then we come apart again

0:06:45.789,0:06:56.799
here 57600 though he's gonna be

0:06:54.459,0:07:04.929
absolutely fine for Laura France still

0:06:56.799,0:07:07.089
going along well with both divers 16th

0:07:04.929,0:07:09.669
place for Eleniak if she wanted a place

0:07:07.089,0:07:12.399
in the top 12 today she knew that every

0:07:09.669,0:07:15.429
single dive to be as good as she could

0:07:12.399,0:07:18.249
make it she's been just back off her

0:07:15.429,0:07:20.050
best so these last two rounds of vitals

0:07:18.249,0:07:24.099
she might need another diver to miss as

0:07:20.050,0:07:30.459
well if she's going to qualify she's 33

0:07:24.099,0:07:32.259
points out of top 12 so close she'll be

0:07:30.459,0:07:35.469
disappointed with the entry because it

0:07:32.259,0:07:38.559
was all going well just everything's to

0:07:35.469,0:07:40.300
slow though finished about three and a

0:07:38.559,0:07:45.279
half meters off the water need to finish

0:07:40.300,0:07:47.559
a lot higher than that good position in

0:07:45.279,0:07:50.489
front of the ears and so the water is

0:07:47.559,0:07:55.360
splashed off the top of their head just

0:07:50.489,0:07:58.289
52.2 Oh then for Ellen qualification

0:07:55.360,0:07:58.289
remains in doubt

0:07:58.580,0:08:04.320
moustache look it's been around about

0:08:02.820,0:08:06.030
the 9th position for the whole of the

0:08:04.320,0:08:09.360
competition the 20 year old Ukraine

0:08:06.030,0:08:12.450
diverse so it's looking at a place in

0:08:09.360,0:08:15.030
the final back to and half somersaults

0:08:12.450,0:08:16.980
in the pike position then at 2.9 but

0:08:15.030,0:08:19.190
there's no room for error here for

0:08:16.980,0:08:19.190
Hannah

0:08:28.820,0:08:33.530
yeah it's a good dive under pressure was

0:08:32.060,0:08:36.260
it sure she was going to make that with

0:08:33.530,0:08:38.630
that leave off the platform oh and she

0:08:36.260,0:08:42.770
jumped she didn't extend her legs her

0:08:38.630,0:08:44.710
legs are bent but the pike here on the

0:08:42.770,0:08:47.990
second part the dive was good and then

0:08:44.710,0:08:51.680
disappears I'm a lot better as well

0:08:47.990,0:08:55.160
nicely pointed so judges like that fifty

0:08:51.680,0:08:58.540
six five five and that should protect

0:08:55.160,0:09:03.470
crust no slicks place at the moment

0:08:58.540,0:09:09.020
Georgia Ward had one little blip in her

0:09:03.470,0:09:12.320
program they were popular with the crowd

0:09:09.020,0:09:15.200
the British divers but she's recovered

0:09:12.320,0:09:23.480
nicely from her blip round four then

0:09:15.200,0:09:25.520
forward three and a half whipped over at

0:09:23.480,0:09:26.690
the end as well and we'll see what the

0:09:25.520,0:09:28.970
judges do with this

0:09:26.690,0:09:31.820
oh what a take-off it was brilliant she

0:09:28.970,0:09:35.750
finishes so high there's the double

0:09:31.820,0:09:38.540
coming around one more I don't think she

0:09:35.750,0:09:41.870
was used to such a great takeoff that

0:09:38.540,0:09:45.650
was superb well unfortunately entry so

0:09:41.870,0:09:47.150
important 46 5 Oh Georgia Ward he's

0:09:45.650,0:09:49.250
gonna have to find her best in the last

0:09:47.150,0:09:51.950
round if she wants to qualify for this

0:09:49.250,0:09:54.620
evening's final that'd be such a shame

0:09:51.950,0:09:57.950
if she missed out because she is clearly

0:09:54.620,0:10:02.390
a talent and could definitely put

0:09:57.950,0:10:04.460
pressure on for the medals 15th position

0:10:02.390,0:10:06.590
at the moment for Celine Van do and have

0:10:04.460,0:10:11.840
done some great work to get into the top

0:10:06.590,0:10:15.020
12 rows as high as 11 and then a Miss in

0:10:11.840,0:10:16.760
the last round so this arm stand back to

0:10:15.020,0:10:22.010
somersaults with one and a half twists

0:10:16.760,0:10:23.780
has got to be good little too quick out

0:10:22.010,0:10:25.700
of that one and a little too splashy

0:10:23.780,0:10:28.640
going through the water I'm not sure

0:10:25.700,0:10:32.300
this will improve her situation very

0:10:28.640,0:10:34.990
lucky on the end here gets the push but

0:10:32.300,0:10:38.500
late into the twist

0:10:34.990,0:10:41.040
just gets the hands for water but not

0:10:38.500,0:10:44.529
fully locked out no they'd liked it

0:10:41.040,0:10:46.570
she'll take that any day of the week 62

0:10:44.529,0:10:49.390
for oh she was expecting to turn round

0:10:46.570,0:10:53.350
and see a mid 50 score there but Celine

0:10:49.390,0:10:57.339
van Duren is still in business and

0:10:53.350,0:11:00.490
really took sent in last place at the

0:10:57.339,0:11:02.980
moment some personal girls will have

0:11:00.490,0:11:08.680
been set for today's performance it'll

0:11:02.980,0:11:15.120
be a all about score $2 left then to

0:11:08.680,0:11:15.120
prove herself in would two and a half

0:11:15.630,0:11:22.420
and what about better dives today yeah

0:11:20.980,0:11:25.899
she was this would be the highest

0:11:22.420,0:11:29.279
scoring dive she hasn't got above 13 on

0:11:25.899,0:11:32.350
the first board dives three dives

0:11:29.279,0:11:34.779
pulling in hard but then breaking

0:11:32.350,0:11:41.459
position feet going flat before lining

0:11:34.779,0:11:41.459
up 82 marks 42 there we go

0:11:41.640,0:11:47.579
took something rather solemn look back

0:11:43.529,0:11:50.240
to the scoreboard as we go back to the

0:11:47.579,0:11:52.500
top of our leaderboard with Maria Cujo

0:11:50.240,0:11:56.540
back to and her off somersaults in the

0:11:52.500,0:11:58.800
pipe position then for the German a

0:11:56.540,0:12:01.890
little bit like back key today she's

0:11:58.800,0:12:05.000
kind of slid under the radar just gone

0:12:01.890,0:12:08.130
about her business and has been solid

0:12:05.000,0:12:10.560
and okay not at best but that's still

0:12:08.130,0:12:14.250
heading towards qualification yeah it's

0:12:10.560,0:12:19.050
been very consistent first I have sixth

0:12:14.250,0:12:23.910
place and in second then third this will

0:12:19.050,0:12:27.899
keep her up in the top five or six yeah

0:12:23.910,0:12:31.589
no problems 56 5 5 quick check with the

0:12:27.899,0:12:35.040
coach about their view on that

0:12:31.589,0:12:38.190
particular dive but that's fine Lilia

0:12:35.040,0:12:41.089
Pocock shook with the big names you're

0:12:38.190,0:12:43.500
never far away from a dive that just

0:12:41.089,0:12:45.660
establishes exactly where they are in

0:12:43.500,0:12:48.240
the pecking order and in the last round

0:12:45.660,0:12:50.910
Pro coccyx sent out a little message to

0:12:48.240,0:12:54.600
the rest of the field if you want gold

0:12:50.910,0:12:58.470
it's me you got to be great diving to

0:12:54.600,0:13:00.390
recover arm stand back three somersaults

0:12:58.470,0:13:06.269
in the Tuck position at three point

0:13:00.390,0:13:08.550
three big dive and a big score coming a

0:13:06.269,0:13:11.760
really big score coming I think she's

0:13:08.550,0:13:15.779
about 75 76 points behind Tonya couch

0:13:11.760,0:13:16.820
and this 3 3 is gonna definitely be in

0:13:15.779,0:13:21.089
the 70s

0:13:16.820,0:13:26.639
strong kick-out great reach back

0:13:21.089,0:13:43.109
oh look at that 75 9 oh and Prokop choke

0:13:26.639,0:13:44.809
reclaims the lead from Tonya couch at

0:13:43.109,0:13:48.869
the top of the leaderboard there's just

0:13:44.809,0:13:51.419
naught point 1 5 in it between Prakash

0:13:48.869,0:13:54.329
Chuck and couch and the likes of Kuya

0:13:51.419,0:13:56.249
Melina and bat key all through but it's

0:13:54.329,0:13:58.109
this part of the leaderboard that were

0:13:56.249,0:13:59.999
interested in anger Alma hangs on to

0:13:58.109,0:14:03.719
12th position Georgia Ward has improved

0:13:59.999,0:14:05.579
placing to 13th for Great Britain but

0:14:03.719,0:14:13.829
this final round of diving is going to

0:14:05.579,0:14:15.659
be very tense indeed a rendus li

0:14:13.829,0:14:17.999
difficult competition to qualify through

0:14:15.659,0:14:20.219
to the final 20 divers 12 places

0:14:17.999,0:14:22.049
available off the women's 10 metre

0:14:20.219,0:14:24.449
platform for this evening's final know

0:14:22.049,0:14:26.009
me back key next onto the board should

0:14:24.449,0:14:28.559
be going there for Italy without any

0:14:26.009,0:14:31.709
dramas but there's a lot of drama around

0:14:28.559,0:14:37.679
position 12 at the moment Italy then for

0:14:31.709,0:14:39.659
a place in the final and the 28 year old

0:14:37.679,0:14:41.549
she won't be pleased with that dive but

0:14:39.659,0:14:42.419
she'll be appearing tonight to compete

0:14:41.549,0:14:44.819
for medals

0:14:42.419,0:14:47.129
yeah jumps away from the platform cuts

0:14:44.819,0:14:49.349
off the height and another diver

0:14:47.129,0:14:52.379
finishing loads of water but she was in

0:14:49.349,0:14:54.869
fish and she will dive better in the

0:14:52.379,0:15:00.539
final former European champion back in

0:14:54.869,0:15:05.129
2011 to 84 though that's a comfortable

0:15:00.539,0:15:06.749
qualification and she and mum Boyet will

0:15:05.129,0:15:09.149
be going away to have a chat about how

0:15:06.749,0:15:12.539
they put that dive list together for

0:15:09.149,0:15:15.029
this evening's final back to the other

0:15:12.539,0:15:17.879
end of the leaderboard and Isabelle font

0:15:15.029,0:15:20.549
Essen of Sweden this is about signing

0:15:17.879,0:15:23.099
off in style and coming away with a

0:15:20.549,0:15:25.489
positive dive she won't be going to the

0:15:23.099,0:15:25.489
final

0:15:25.830,0:15:29.620
but she has benefited from the

0:15:27.880,0:15:31.540
experience and again another diver going

0:15:29.620,0:15:34.240
a long long way down the pool and away

0:15:31.540,0:15:35.800
from the platform yeah just it's the

0:15:34.240,0:15:37.990
technique if you haven't got the right

0:15:35.800,0:15:39.670
timing on the jump and momentum of the

0:15:37.990,0:15:46.030
run down the board just drags you

0:15:39.670,0:15:46.360
forward high score so far is 46 there we

0:15:46.030,0:15:48.490
go

0:15:46.360,0:15:51.100
an improvement and a positive forty

0:15:48.490,0:15:55.140
seven eight five but still under the 200

0:15:51.100,0:15:55.140
mark across five rounds of diving

0:15:56.460,0:16:01.150
Christina Russ and shouldn't be a

0:15:58.390,0:16:04.360
problem for her sixth position at the

0:16:01.150,0:16:09.610
moment finishes with this back twister

0:16:04.360,0:16:12.510
at 3.2 and on occasion the German has

0:16:09.610,0:16:12.510
looked really good

0:16:16.200,0:16:20.970
and she will be trying to dive like that

0:16:19.170,0:16:23.630
all the way through the final this

0:16:20.970,0:16:27.420
evening it's a good strong finish

0:16:23.630,0:16:29.579
beautiful twist and she knows the end

0:16:27.420,0:16:32.519
she again she will be pleased with this

0:16:29.579,0:16:34.589
she finished 15th last year had a

0:16:32.519,0:16:38.279
terrible competition and didn't make the

0:16:34.589,0:16:42.449
final first diver over 300 is Cristina

0:16:38.279,0:16:45.839
Vasan another 70 score for her and the

0:16:42.449,0:16:49.440
smile confirms a place in the final so

0:16:45.839,0:16:51.149
Germany should qualify to through Russia

0:16:49.440,0:16:55.680
still in doubt as to whether they can

0:16:51.149,0:16:58.889
qualify both their divers Petra Cova is

0:16:55.680,0:17:00.990
there hope now seventh position after

0:16:58.889,0:17:04.820
four rounds final dive back two and half

0:17:00.990,0:17:04.820
somersaults with one and a half twists

0:17:08.600,0:17:13.260
and that will be a Katarina through to

0:17:11.220,0:17:16.470
the final again not our best by any

0:17:13.260,0:17:19.260
means but safe enough same thing bends

0:17:16.470,0:17:21.900
the knees and the hips go back so it's

0:17:19.260,0:17:24.360
jumping backwards into the twister

0:17:21.900,0:17:33.960
rolling up and it makes it hard to pull

0:17:24.360,0:17:38.520
into the pipe after 26 3 5 yeah slightly

0:17:33.960,0:17:42.120
better than back keep still not into the

0:17:38.520,0:17:43.919
300s pressure dive then for young

0:17:42.120,0:17:47.250
revealer comas we'll have seen her great

0:17:43.919,0:17:51.710
friend Sofia Risinger miss her last

0:17:47.250,0:17:51.710
round so no she's Hungary's only chance

0:17:52.160,0:17:57.419
again toes mighty tight to the end and

0:17:55.470,0:18:00.470
she's gone right over on the finish and

0:17:57.419,0:18:04.320
she might have blown it with this dive I

0:18:00.470,0:18:06.809
don't think she's gonna make 270 she was

0:18:04.320,0:18:12.169
in 10th place good three and a half at

0:18:06.809,0:18:13.610
this point but then out way too late oh

0:18:12.169,0:18:16.169
dear

0:18:13.610,0:18:17.910
253 100 and it looks like both

0:18:16.169,0:18:21.050
Hungarians are going to miss out this

0:18:17.910,0:18:24.140
evening well that's a real shame

0:18:21.050,0:18:26.460
[Applause]

0:18:24.140,0:18:31.559
Britta now still with the chance of

0:18:26.460,0:18:35.039
qualifying to new couch has been in top

0:18:31.559,0:18:36.960
spot for most of this competition just

0:18:35.039,0:18:40.820
been surpassed by prokop chick in the

0:18:36.960,0:18:44.549
last round but couch to finish strongly

0:18:40.820,0:18:46.500
and to go through to the final as one of

0:18:44.549,0:18:49.440
the gold medal favorites that's the

0:18:46.500,0:18:50.789
entry of the day that's the best reverse

0:18:49.440,0:18:56.070
two-and-a-half was seen in the

0:18:50.789,0:18:58.980
competition jam strong spots the water

0:18:56.070,0:19:01.230
heats tire reaches back she squeezes

0:18:58.980,0:19:03.360
their ears and all the splash goes down

0:19:01.230,0:19:05.880
with her what a message to send out

0:19:03.360,0:19:07.890
another 70 score for couch and three

0:19:05.880,0:19:11.330
forty five to zero

0:19:07.890,0:19:11.330
that's a brilliant performance

0:19:14.970,0:19:22.840
christena church gap for Belarus has

0:19:19.930,0:19:25.300
been a little nervy up there hasn't

0:19:22.840,0:19:27.070
found our best form but has still

0:19:25.300,0:19:30.550
managed to turn in a reasonable score

0:19:27.070,0:19:33.720
but from 17th he's outside the

0:19:30.550,0:19:33.720
qualification zone

0:19:37.760,0:19:42.500
but we'll take a positive finish away

0:19:40.370,0:19:44.810
from this prelim legs a little bit messy

0:19:42.500,0:19:47.030
at the top but the entry was fine yeah

0:19:44.810,0:19:50.360
shouldn't I be just working on adding an

0:19:47.030,0:19:53.570
extra twist to that half twist good pipe

0:19:50.360,0:19:58.280
position didn't grab her hands correctly

0:19:53.570,0:20:00.350
she grabbed a wrist two 28-0 so

0:19:58.280,0:20:02.270
confirmation that gesture will not be

0:20:00.350,0:20:04.370
going through to the final but she says

0:20:02.270,0:20:08.330
cheerio with a smile nice final dive

0:20:04.370,0:20:09.950
from her a tough position for Sofia

0:20:08.330,0:20:11.690
Risinger to be in the twenty

0:20:09.950,0:20:15.200
six-year-old one of the most experienced

0:20:11.690,0:20:16.970
divers at this prelim competition but

0:20:15.200,0:20:19.040
knows that this dive is a dive to

0:20:16.970,0:20:20.690
nothing because she won't be going

0:20:19.040,0:20:22.460
through to the final this evening back

0:20:20.690,0:20:27.250
one and a half somersaults then with two

0:20:22.460,0:20:27.250
and a half twists to finish for Sofia

0:20:46.279,0:20:51.619
oh that's an incredibly frustrating

0:20:49.330,0:20:53.690
competition and finished for her she'll

0:20:51.619,0:20:55.999
just have to look back on the bronze

0:20:53.690,0:20:58.700
from the synchro competition here and

0:20:55.999,0:21:01.099
enjoy that and she'll be disappointed

0:20:58.700,0:21:03.559
with the entry because the dye of itself

0:21:01.099,0:21:06.289
was very good she lifted the chest up on

0:21:03.559,0:21:07.249
the entry and dropped a little short -

0:21:06.289,0:21:10.269
oh seven eight oh

0:21:07.249,0:21:15.200
and that is way off right injures

0:21:10.269,0:21:17.659
ability score is three ten hundred

0:21:15.200,0:21:19.789
points less than she's capable of doing

0:21:17.659,0:21:23.299
not a great day at the office for either

0:21:19.789,0:21:27.519
of the Hungarian divers Laura Marano

0:21:23.299,0:21:31.129
then at 22 years of age just coming into

0:21:27.519,0:21:33.169
peak zone for platform divers got the

0:21:31.129,0:21:34.549
experience got the skills certainly got

0:21:33.169,0:21:37.219
the degree of difficulty on the dive

0:21:34.549,0:21:41.359
list and proved it last year with that

0:21:37.219,0:21:44.089
silver medal and in with pre-capture can

0:21:41.359,0:21:45.979
couch and bat key and kuroky will go

0:21:44.089,0:21:47.559
through as one of the favourites for a

0:21:45.979,0:21:49.940
medal

0:21:47.559,0:21:52.969
okay little flutter with the feet and a

0:21:49.940,0:21:54.649
horrible entry means a Miss in the final

0:21:52.969,0:21:57.440
round but it would be good enough for

0:21:54.649,0:21:59.089
qualification that's so unusual

0:21:57.440,0:22:01.820
she didn't swing your arms up fast

0:21:59.089,0:22:04.249
enough so there's no rotation here tries

0:22:01.820,0:22:12.799
to pull into a tight Pike but it hasn't

0:22:04.249,0:22:15.499
worked just 40 marks 271 five Oh

0:22:12.799,0:22:17.269
and now Moreno is gonna have to wait and

0:22:15.499,0:22:19.719
see I thought she was safely home and

0:22:17.269,0:22:19.719
dry there

0:22:19.840,0:22:31.130
this is incredibly tight around position

0:22:23.570,0:22:35.690
to have around that bobble act then she

0:22:31.130,0:22:37.789
caused a problem a little bit too low to

0:22:35.690,0:22:40.220
the water there as she came out the

0:22:37.789,0:22:43.730
Swede there's a good final diet that

0:22:40.220,0:22:46.730
she's too far back on shore to get into

0:22:43.730,0:22:48.340
the top 12 the moment you just don't

0:22:46.730,0:22:50.600
know where this competition

0:22:48.340,0:22:52.909
well the bobble looks like it's gonna be

0:22:50.600,0:22:56.690
around about that 270 mark which is a

0:22:52.909,0:23:00.020
lake along Yee of France 278 5 everybody

0:22:56.690,0:23:01.669
above that might just be safe but you're

0:23:00.020,0:23:04.940
never sure until the competition is

0:23:01.669,0:23:08.200
finished 238 to 0 Eleniak won't be going

0:23:04.940,0:23:08.200
through that's one thing we can be sure

0:23:09.370,0:23:13.940
pal across nice look here in 8th

0:23:11.780,0:23:18.470
position there are no guarantees in this

0:23:13.940,0:23:20.720
prelim and that battle for top 12 is

0:23:18.470,0:23:22.760
going to be tight to 70 or around there

0:23:20.720,0:23:24.590
are all in with the chance the

0:23:22.760,0:23:27.440
concretion oh look push everybody down

0:23:24.590,0:23:29.090
one position here with this dive reverse

0:23:27.440,0:23:36.919
two-and-a-half somersaults then Frawley

0:23:29.090,0:23:38.210
ukraine diver all very slow spin but

0:23:36.919,0:23:39.799
she's done the right thing at the end

0:23:38.210,0:23:40.580
there Chris and managed to get it into

0:23:39.799,0:23:42.679
the water

0:23:40.580,0:23:44.570
yeah she slipped forward off the ball

0:23:42.679,0:23:47.240
finished very low I was looking at the

0:23:44.570,0:23:51.190
scores to be safe I was reckoning around

0:23:47.240,0:23:51.190
she needs 48 50 points

0:23:51.290,0:23:54.890
she's just about what I think yeah she

0:23:54.020,0:23:57.650
has she's fine

0:23:54.890,0:24:01.280
278 won oh so crushed nosh look goes

0:23:57.650,0:24:03.050
into the top 12 and that will just bump

0:24:01.280,0:24:06.770
everybody down a position that puts

0:24:03.050,0:24:09.950
Yulia Tymoshenko and to tenth and Kalani

0:24:06.770,0:24:13.460
down to ninth Moreno as well in 8th from

0:24:09.950,0:24:16.100
271 five-oh which leaves the door wide

0:24:13.460,0:24:17.870
open for this young lady 20 year old

0:24:16.100,0:24:19.640
George award from Great Britain with a

0:24:17.870,0:24:22.100
good degree of difficulty on this inward

0:24:19.640,0:24:34.880
three and a half this for a place in the

0:24:22.100,0:24:37.940
final just out of sync on that entry but

0:24:34.880,0:24:41.240
this is going to be really tight maybe

0:24:37.940,0:24:48.080
around 58 points will get her into the

0:24:41.240,0:24:54.140
top 12 just like it the judges like it

0:24:48.080,0:24:56.030
278 15.5 ahead of crush noise look and

0:24:54.140,0:24:58.250
that looks like Georgia warden Tonya

0:24:56.030,0:25:01.910
couch in the final for this evening's

0:24:58.250,0:25:04.250
competition for Great Britain all the

0:25:01.910,0:25:07.510
pressure passing down the line saline

0:25:04.250,0:25:12.440
van Duren now for the Netherlands in

0:25:07.510,0:25:14.900
11th place but this is by no means a

0:25:12.440,0:25:16.490
guaranteed place in the final back two

0:25:14.900,0:25:18.380
and a half somersaults in the pike at

0:25:16.490,0:25:25.730
two point nine this has to be really

0:25:18.380,0:25:27.470
good to make it aa good response to the

0:25:25.730,0:25:30.920
pressure but the splash might be an

0:25:27.470,0:25:35.210
issue here needs to get over the 15th

0:25:30.920,0:25:37.650
know about 48 points 50 points I'm not

0:25:35.210,0:25:39.880
sure will she get it

0:25:37.650,0:25:42.940
exchange she's cool all the water on the

0:25:39.880,0:25:47.160
back of the shoulders oh I think she's

0:25:42.940,0:25:50.260
done just enough to seventy four to five

0:25:47.160,0:25:52.210
puts ran doing in at seventh place just

0:25:50.260,0:25:56.560
ahead of Vanguard armor Marino and

0:25:52.210,0:25:57.990
Kalani mathematically she will go

0:25:56.560,0:26:01.540
through she's fine

0:25:57.990,0:26:03.580
and if it tooks and then we can take her

0:26:01.540,0:26:06.430
a little break from the drama of

0:26:03.580,0:26:08.140
qualification because took some won't be

0:26:06.430,0:26:10.000
going to the final so this is about a

0:26:08.140,0:26:12.160
positive finish to the competition big

0:26:10.000,0:26:14.640
dive for her the back twister at three

0:26:12.160,0:26:14.640
point two

0:26:20.650,0:26:27.490
oh and she's done it well great finish

0:26:23.470,0:26:30.670
yeah a little wobbly on the end good

0:26:27.490,0:26:34.720
twist the pike a little untidy going

0:26:30.670,0:26:36.340
from the twist now into the pike legs

0:26:34.720,0:26:41.770
aren't really locked out toes could be a

0:26:36.340,0:26:44.050
bit more pointed so just over the 200

0:26:41.770,0:26:46.680
mark for took sin but no qualification

0:26:44.050,0:26:46.680
to the final

0:26:50.270,0:26:58.020
so two divers to come to finish off this

0:26:54.240,0:26:59.880
10 metre competition and then we will

0:26:58.020,0:27:03.330
know our top 12 to go through from the

0:26:59.880,0:27:05.430
20 this afternoon and both of them

0:27:03.330,0:27:07.260
should qualify Maria Kuchar first for

0:27:05.430,0:27:10.980
Germany then Lily apricot Chuck for

0:27:07.260,0:27:12.570
Ukraine and it's not great I'm afraid

0:27:10.980,0:27:14.730
from courage Oh fortunately for her she

0:27:12.570,0:27:18.450
was way up the leaderboard ahead of this

0:27:14.730,0:27:19.830
dive no jump finishes low washes over

0:27:18.450,0:27:22.850
her feet flat

0:27:19.830,0:27:27.090
that was a poor diet she was in third

0:27:22.850,0:27:29.510
but she needed 595 points to go ahead of

0:27:27.090,0:27:35.460
Tonya she was two points

0:27:29.510,0:27:38.430
she's fine so Kojo 294 five five is

0:27:35.460,0:27:42.210
through to the final it signs off with a

0:27:38.430,0:27:45.120
kiss last diver defending champion Lily

0:27:42.210,0:27:47.550
apricot Chuck will bump Kalani

0:27:45.120,0:27:51.360
out of the top 12 for France but Laura

0:27:47.550,0:27:52.970
Marano is going to hang on in 12th

0:27:51.360,0:27:55.650
position

0:27:52.970,0:28:00.960
assuming that precook just gets the

0:27:55.650,0:28:03.330
score out of this dive slightly

0:28:00.960,0:28:08.550
ponderous back twister but what an entry

0:28:03.330,0:28:10.860
she beats 70 1.30 to go ahead of Tonya

0:28:08.550,0:28:14.040
couch and it's a high degree of

0:28:10.860,0:28:17.059
difficulty good twist there pulls him

0:28:14.040,0:28:18.769
really well because of the entries

0:28:17.059,0:28:20.990
a little bit wobbly I'm not sure she

0:28:18.769,0:28:23.769
hasn't got it no second place that means

0:28:20.990,0:28:27.080
Tonya couch does win the prelims and

0:28:23.769,0:28:30.200
will go through as the favorite for gold

0:28:27.080,0:28:32.629
to this evening's final but that's going

0:28:30.200,0:28:34.970
to be one heck of a shootout between her

0:28:32.629,0:28:36.769
and the defending champion and let's not

0:28:34.970,0:28:39.259
forget that whole host of names to

0:28:36.769,0:28:41.659
factor in the likes of Kershaw and bat

0:28:39.259,0:28:43.610
ki will be there Christine of us and

0:28:41.659,0:28:45.649
going really well both Germans in 3rd

0:28:43.610,0:28:47.929
and 4th Pacheco has made it through

0:28:45.649,0:28:50.029
Jorge award brilliant finish to qualify

0:28:47.929,0:28:52.220
in 7th position so Great Britain have

0:28:50.029,0:28:55.129
two competitors through but here's the

0:28:52.220,0:28:57.860
important facts timoshkin ena has missed

0:28:55.129,0:29:01.039
out and Kalani does hang on for the 12th

0:28:57.860,0:29:03.409
place Laura Mariner in 11th and France

0:29:01.039,0:29:05.389
do qualify to through but that is a very

0:29:03.409,0:29:08.289
tight competition it's going to be a

0:29:05.389,0:29:08.289
brilliant final

0:29:08.780,0:29:14.030
the divers being introduced to a

0:29:11.690,0:29:16.850
fantastic crowd here at the London

0:29:14.030,0:29:20.810
Aquatic Center at this evening for the

0:29:16.850,0:29:23.360
winnings 10 meter final when he occurs

0:29:20.810,0:29:26.480
EUR for Germany just making her way out

0:29:23.360,0:29:28.220
certainly amongst the favorites followed

0:29:26.480,0:29:30.080
by her compassion what a great

0:29:28.220,0:29:32.660
performance she was 17 year old in the

0:29:30.080,0:29:36.710
prelims Christina Batson to get through

0:29:32.660,0:29:39.020
in third place and to follow Christine

0:29:36.710,0:29:41.630
and the two big guns in tonight's

0:29:39.020,0:29:46.360
competition the courtship looking pretty

0:29:41.630,0:29:49.490
cool the Ukraine defending champion

0:29:46.360,0:29:51.830
looking to make it another win to add to

0:29:49.490,0:29:54.950
the four that she already has on this

0:29:51.830,0:29:55.630
apparatus and can Tonya couch do it

0:29:54.950,0:29:57.890
tonight

0:29:55.630,0:30:02.840
brilliant performance in the prelims

0:29:57.890,0:30:05.180
from the British girl and Tonya couch

0:30:02.840,0:30:08.090
comes into this final as marginal

0:30:05.180,0:30:10.250
favorite but that's going to be a very

0:30:08.090,0:30:13.820
good shootout to watch between prokop

0:30:10.250,0:30:16.370
cook and couch Simon Golding and former

0:30:13.820,0:30:18.770
Olympian euro sport diving expert Chris

0:30:16.370,0:30:21.170
snowed alongside me for you coverage

0:30:18.770,0:30:22.730
this evening from the diving Paul to

0:30:21.170,0:30:24.830
great events to look forward to the

0:30:22.730,0:30:26.780
first one I should be very interesting

0:30:24.830,0:30:30.080
indeed they're women's ten Mitra is

0:30:26.780,0:30:33.860
always interesting but the standard was

0:30:30.080,0:30:37.010
so high this morning you had to get 270

0:30:33.860,0:30:39.110
just to make the top 12 normally is 250

0:30:37.010,0:30:41.630
and there was a blinding performance

0:30:39.110,0:30:43.630
from Sonia never had a medal in the

0:30:41.630,0:30:46.780
individual Europeans on 10

0:30:43.630,0:30:49.270
before and she'd be the reigning

0:30:46.780,0:30:52.090
champion pro culture they both averaged

0:30:49.270,0:30:54.700
70 points and it could go even higher

0:30:52.090,0:30:56.650
today and to put that into context in

0:30:54.700,0:30:58.480
terms of the points for the gold and how

0:30:56.650,0:31:01.480
that compares with the Chinese with Rio

0:30:58.480,0:31:05.530
just around the corner well if you take

0:31:01.480,0:31:09.550
Chenery Lin in 2008 she averaged 89

0:31:05.530,0:31:14.350
point for a dive world record of 437

0:31:09.550,0:31:16.630
points yes put it into context but

0:31:14.350,0:31:18.910
tonight it's all about the European

0:31:16.630,0:31:20.560
Championship and the winner of the next

0:31:18.910,0:31:22.870
gold medal in the women's 10 metre

0:31:20.560,0:31:25.330
platform competition as I said Tonya

0:31:22.870,0:31:27.610
couch for the home nation comes in as

0:31:25.330,0:31:29.800
marginal favorite and she's got George

0:31:27.610,0:31:32.680
Award for company who has a very good

0:31:29.800,0:31:34.450
dive list indeed she has a degree of

0:31:32.680,0:31:36.340
difficulty that could get her a medal

0:31:34.450,0:31:38.140
but there's a whole host of athletes

0:31:36.340,0:31:40.920
that could be on the podium by the end

0:31:38.140,0:31:40.920
of this one

0:31:45.669,0:31:51.579
- our divers have qualified through from

0:31:48.549,0:31:53.709
the prelim competition of 24 this

0:31:51.579,0:31:55.809
woman's 10 metre platform file on the

0:31:53.709,0:31:59.799
first of two gold medals on offer in the

0:31:55.809,0:32:02.889
diving pool on day five of the 2016

0:31:59.799,0:32:05.799
European Aquatics Championships and they

0:32:02.889,0:32:09.969
go right up to the highest platform in

0:32:05.799,0:32:15.099
this fabulous diving arena to contest

0:32:09.969,0:32:17.049
gold medal number eight Tonya couch for

0:32:15.099,0:32:19.329
Great Britain was in superb form in the

0:32:17.049,0:32:21.789
prelims but all of the divers it has to

0:32:19.329,0:32:24.729
be said did miss a dive so we've always

0:32:21.789,0:32:28.329
got that potential for this event to be

0:32:24.729,0:32:31.029
turned on its head if someone who misses

0:32:28.329,0:32:32.950
misses with a very low score

0:32:31.029,0:32:35.889
we hope that doesn't happen this evening

0:32:32.950,0:32:38.309
on Friday the 13th we hope that we get a

0:32:35.889,0:32:40.809
very good contest for the gold medal

0:32:38.309,0:32:42.159
France have qualified two athletes

0:32:40.809,0:32:45.099
through a lie Kalonji

0:32:42.159,0:32:46.809
is going to be the first diver the 18

0:32:45.099,0:32:49.479
year old she'll be followed straightaway

0:32:46.809,0:32:52.089
by her senior compact reott laura marano

0:32:49.479,0:32:55.389
who took silver last time out but for

0:32:52.089,0:32:58.419
Kalonji this is very much a step up to

0:32:55.389,0:32:59.950
the senior level and she's going to open

0:32:58.419,0:33:03.639
with an inward two and a half

0:32:59.950,0:33:09.639
somersaults at 2.8 and that's a fine

0:33:03.639,0:33:12.219
stop soon as she was on the end she

0:33:09.639,0:33:15.159
sprung off it's the entry that was

0:33:12.219,0:33:19.109
impressive those springy jump good line

0:33:15.159,0:33:22.389
up because there's hardly any splash

0:33:19.109,0:33:24.609
fantastic pike there she's gonna score

0:33:22.389,0:33:30.070
really well yes they roll on the end

0:33:24.609,0:33:32.499
just maybe one or two degrees oh alright

0:33:30.070,0:33:35.440
so this is a sign of things to come in

0:33:32.499,0:33:38.009
terms of scoring coach by Frederic

0:33:35.440,0:33:38.009
Pierre

0:33:38.130,0:33:42.860
and you'll see the coach is interacting

0:33:40.679,0:33:45.539
with the divers on a constant basis

0:33:42.860,0:33:47.880
they've been new to the sport of diving

0:33:45.539,0:33:49.860
here on Eurosport that's a normal

0:33:47.880,0:33:52.590
feature the divers get feedback

0:33:49.860,0:33:55.110
constantly from the coaches and very

0:33:52.590,0:33:56.820
much encourage it as well and as soon as

0:33:55.110,0:33:59.970
that's happened then they go off and

0:33:56.820,0:34:01.679
start to visualize for the next round of

0:33:59.970,0:34:03.419
dives which means the camera operator

0:34:01.679,0:34:06.600
has to follow them so that we can get

0:34:03.419,0:34:09.000
score graphic up at some point we will

0:34:06.600,0:34:10.350
have it in a moment for you I can tell

0:34:09.000,0:34:12.810
you based on what we've heard in the

0:34:10.350,0:34:14.310
background from the judges scores it's

0:34:12.810,0:34:17.820
gonna be a good one it will be a good

0:34:14.310,0:34:22.230
one she got 61 in the prelims and this

0:34:17.820,0:34:24.119
is far superior in any moment now

0:34:22.230,0:34:26.429
but I think this is gonna be a cracking

0:34:24.119,0:34:28.169
opening score for LA Kalonji

0:34:26.429,0:34:32.669
well in an entry like that the divers

0:34:28.169,0:34:35.419
worth at least eight maybe even more had

0:34:32.669,0:34:35.419
no space whatsoever

0:34:36.089,0:34:42.040
now I still predict it's gonna be an

0:34:39.460,0:34:44.800
average of 70 or more to win this

0:34:42.040,0:34:47.139
contest so if any of the girls can get

0:34:44.800,0:34:50.260
close to that throughout there they're

0:34:47.139,0:34:53.470
gonna get gold silver or bronze and

0:34:50.260,0:34:57.220
that's not far off is it 67 to 0 from

0:34:53.470,0:34:59.500
Kalonji good start from the French

0:34:57.220,0:35:03.069
number 2 and we turn to the French

0:34:59.500,0:35:04.660
number 1 for the next dive Laura morrow

0:35:03.069,0:35:07.440
not in would three and a half

0:35:04.660,0:35:09.970
somersaults in the top position at 3.2

0:35:07.440,0:35:13.150
she might be diving as the 11th

0:35:09.970,0:35:16.410
qualifier but she has the scoring

0:35:13.150,0:35:19.150
capability and the tariff on the dives

0:35:16.410,0:35:22.060
to make a big impression this evening

0:35:19.150,0:35:26.040
and remember prelims score goes out the

0:35:22.060,0:35:28.450
window this is back to square one

0:35:26.040,0:35:31.980
Maryland for France in wood three and a

0:35:28.450,0:35:31.980
half in the tuck position

0:35:42.100,0:35:47.300
it's a mess and this is what the contest

0:35:45.080,0:35:50.690
could come down to tonight Chris if you

0:35:47.300,0:35:53.960
do miss its by how much you miss those

0:35:50.690,0:35:56.240
disastrous you win 72 points in the

0:35:53.960,0:35:58.850
prelims there though she fell out of it

0:35:56.240,0:36:00.380
out too late a little bit close with her

0:35:58.850,0:36:02.690
hair coming around on the first

0:36:00.380,0:36:05.030
somersault there's that miss there

0:36:02.690,0:36:07.730
doesn't pick up the water on the triple

0:36:05.030,0:36:13.160
neither's found the spot the water come

0:36:07.730,0:36:16.310
out quick silver medal last year well

0:36:13.160,0:36:20.540
this was as Chris said 72 in the prelims

0:36:16.310,0:36:23.660
this will be closer to 27 it's certainly

0:36:20.540,0:36:25.970
not gonna make it into the 50s remains

0:36:23.660,0:36:30.980
to be seen if she can make it into the

0:36:25.970,0:36:34.310
40's she can 49:6 doe so Mariano gets

0:36:30.980,0:36:35.960
off to a poor start on the 2015 silver

0:36:34.310,0:36:37.270
medalist in this event under pressure

0:36:35.960,0:36:40.220
already

0:36:37.270,0:36:42.560
now what a refreshing change this young

0:36:40.220,0:36:44.900
lady was earlier today 17 year old

0:36:42.560,0:36:47.540
Genevieve green under Army from

0:36:44.900,0:36:49.400
Lithuania but actually left with you

0:36:47.540,0:36:51.770
only when she was 2 years of age and has

0:36:49.400,0:36:54.290
done all of her diving in the USA trains

0:36:51.770,0:37:00.290
alongside World Championships synchro

0:36:54.290,0:37:02.000
finalist Cassidy cook and a horrible

0:37:00.290,0:37:03.530
inward two and a half to start I'm

0:37:02.000,0:37:05.930
afraid and you heard the crowd groan

0:37:03.530,0:37:08.750
this has gone badly wrong yeah it's

0:37:05.930,0:37:12.380
right on us on the start she slips right

0:37:08.750,0:37:15.470
here oh she is so lucky that that didn't

0:37:12.380,0:37:18.020
go badly badly wrong for her yeah she

0:37:15.470,0:37:20.839
slips and you just there was nothing to

0:37:18.020,0:37:23.130
push against

0:37:20.839,0:37:24.809
she was actually lucky that her feet

0:37:23.130,0:37:26.970
didn't hit on that first somersault as

0:37:24.809,0:37:28.940
well that would have stopped her

0:37:26.970,0:37:31.079
completely there she's smiling she's

0:37:28.940,0:37:33.180
unbelievable that's uh felt like yeah

0:37:31.079,0:37:37.859
still smiling away whole competition to

0:37:33.180,0:37:40.049
go but has to accept a sub 20 mark I'm

0:37:37.859,0:37:42.660
afraid for that openness so an Jian army

0:37:40.049,0:37:45.210
having made the final big day for her

0:37:42.660,0:37:47.490
that was a huge result unfortunately

0:37:45.210,0:37:52.289
hasn't got the star she wanted in the

0:37:47.490,0:37:54.510
final itself next up from the

0:37:52.289,0:37:56.490
Netherlands Celine van dune 23 years of

0:37:54.510,0:37:58.650
age now starts with a bang twister so

0:37:56.490,0:38:02.720
back two and a half somersaults with one

0:37:58.650,0:38:02.720
and a half twists in the pipe position

0:38:06.140,0:38:09.779
you just heard in the background the

0:38:08.190,0:38:12.029
announcer here in the stadium just

0:38:09.779,0:38:14.730
letting everybody know that there is an

0:38:12.029,0:38:17.130
input issue with the scouring pads we've

0:38:14.730,0:38:19.020
had the odd electronic gremlin during

0:38:17.130,0:38:20.609
the course of this week Chris but it's

0:38:19.020,0:38:30.630
to be expected it's a very complex

0:38:20.609,0:38:33.480
system then they go to flip cards the

0:38:30.630,0:38:36.809
old system back to the good old days yes

0:38:33.480,0:38:41.250
I think that's when colour telly was

0:38:36.809,0:38:42.990
just being invented as well it's always

0:38:41.250,0:38:45.599
a bit of fun to see that let's hope that

0:38:42.990,0:38:49.289
they do manage to fix the problem

0:38:45.599,0:38:51.539
quickly because we all enjoy seeing the

0:38:49.289,0:38:53.190
graphics come up the split of all the

0:38:51.539,0:38:55.710
marks from all the judges that's it

0:38:53.190,0:38:57.809
tremendously helpful from everyone's

0:38:55.710,0:38:59.250
point of view it's really hard to use

0:38:57.809,0:39:02.160
the flip cards nowadays because they

0:38:59.250,0:39:05.069
blinker the judges so in between each of

0:39:02.160,0:39:07.170
the judges there is a screen and you

0:39:05.069,0:39:09.119
can't look across that also means that

0:39:07.170,0:39:11.099
the judge is closest to the recorders

0:39:09.119,0:39:13.049
table won't be able to see anything that

0:39:11.099,0:39:15.089
the judges put up and there's three of

0:39:13.049,0:39:18.350
them over there and there's four on the

0:39:15.089,0:39:21.620
far side where the 3-meter springboard

0:39:18.350,0:39:24.190
while it's thrown the judging committee

0:39:21.620,0:39:26.810
in the panel into a bit of turmoil and

0:39:24.190,0:39:29.510
they're all now holding up the cards on

0:39:26.810,0:39:31.100
the main table holding up the cards for

0:39:29.510,0:39:32.450
the judges to say look this is what

0:39:31.100,0:39:35.840
we've got to go to we've got to go to

0:39:32.450,0:39:37.100
the old paper system so electronics at

0:39:35.840,0:39:39.230
the moment look to be out the window

0:39:37.100,0:39:41.330
this is not good for Saline Vanda and

0:39:39.230,0:39:43.010
incidentally it's okay if you're not up

0:39:41.330,0:39:45.980
there on the steps or up there on the

0:39:43.010,0:39:47.510
board yeah you can take a little bit of

0:39:45.980,0:39:49.490
a pause but if you're already up there

0:39:47.510,0:39:50.510
then this is a very touchy moment and if

0:39:49.490,0:39:52.400
you haven't got your competition

0:39:50.510,0:39:53.630
underway either as well then this is

0:39:52.400,0:39:55.640
going to take a little bit of mental

0:39:53.630,0:40:00.560
toughness to get through this period and

0:39:55.640,0:40:04.010
it's the first round as well as over

0:40:00.560,0:40:06.860
when they get wet well we had already

0:40:04.010,0:40:08.590
got confirmation of that mark from

0:40:06.860,0:40:13.880
unguent army there it is again

0:40:08.590,0:40:16.550
19600 unfortunately no reprieve she

0:40:13.880,0:40:18.050
would just be very grateful that nothing

0:40:16.550,0:40:19.910
else went wrong with that dive because

0:40:18.050,0:40:23.420
once that foot slipped away she could

0:40:19.910,0:40:26.420
have been in real trouble so time at

0:40:23.420,0:40:30.050
last for Saline run down that back

0:40:26.420,0:40:31.910
twister that I described at 3.2 she's

0:40:30.050,0:40:34.250
got three dives that go into the three

0:40:31.910,0:40:37.510
so not a bad dive list from the 23 year

0:40:34.250,0:40:37.510
old Dutch woman

0:40:43.030,0:40:48.820
and well considering the weight that was

0:40:46.930,0:40:50.500
a pretty good effort yeah very good

0:40:48.820,0:40:51.970
effort I did think she was gonna write

0:40:50.500,0:40:54.340
over on the end but she didn't she

0:40:51.970,0:40:55.300
controlled the entry here's the job that

0:40:54.340,0:40:58.320
was good

0:40:55.300,0:41:00.880
only a little bit away from the platform

0:40:58.320,0:41:03.100
one and a half twist now that's the hard

0:41:00.880,0:41:05.590
bit pulling force into the pike

0:41:03.100,0:41:06.940
just a small wobble there the splash had

0:41:05.590,0:41:08.530
been thrown up because her hands not

0:41:06.940,0:41:12.400
flat enough from the water but

0:41:08.530,0:41:15.520
technically a good dive in the prelims

0:41:12.400,0:41:20.080
she only went 50 points this is far

0:41:15.520,0:41:24.010
better yes sixty five six oh great

0:41:20.080,0:41:26.590
opener I'm not the only person that had

0:41:24.010,0:41:28.290
to wait for us nice look of Ukraine

0:41:26.590,0:41:32.650
would have been halfway up the steps

0:41:28.290,0:41:37.870
waiting to go in with two and a half

0:41:32.650,0:41:39.790
somersaults then for her that's a very

0:41:37.870,0:41:42.340
good synchro record and as done well

0:41:39.790,0:41:44.280
with Janko in the past but on an

0:41:42.340,0:41:47.620
individual basis still looking for that

0:41:44.280,0:41:55.000
first big result just outside the medals

0:41:47.620,0:41:56.620
last time around in fifth position she

0:41:55.000,0:41:58.330
has a little problem with flattening the

0:41:56.620,0:42:00.040
feet off she did it in the prelims as

0:41:58.330,0:42:02.620
well but the dive overall is still good

0:42:00.040,0:42:05.050
yeah in the prelims she was close this

0:42:02.620,0:42:07.090
isn't close didn't need to flatten her

0:42:05.050,0:42:09.310
feet I think it's more of a habit now

0:42:07.090,0:42:11.110
that was a really good take on just need

0:42:09.310,0:42:16.420
to keep those toes pointed she would

0:42:11.110,0:42:20.200
have been all right good entry though so

0:42:16.420,0:42:23.589
there's only maybe ten centimeters of

0:42:20.200,0:42:29.019
splash it's gonna be a good score

0:42:23.589,0:42:32.229
it is a good score 63 Oh Joker even

0:42:29.019,0:42:34.239
income with a bit of advice and listen

0:42:32.229,0:42:37.029
to this reception from the home crowd

0:42:34.239,0:42:39.489
for the home athlete Georgia Wars diving

0:42:37.029,0:42:42.549
in her home pool this is where she

0:42:39.489,0:42:45.849
trains along with Tom Daley and coach

0:42:42.549,0:42:47.650
Jane Figueredo already has a bronze

0:42:45.849,0:42:50.079
medal from this european championships

0:42:47.650,0:42:52.269
in the team event with matty lee and has

0:42:50.079,0:42:54.900
a massive dive list she starts with the

0:42:52.269,0:42:54.900
back twister

0:42:59.990,0:43:06.150
it's okay it's okay in terms of degree

0:43:03.390,0:43:08.550
of difficulty Chris she has got a dive

0:43:06.150,0:43:10.770
list that can rival anyone yes there's

0:43:08.550,0:43:14.250
three divers doing back three and halfs

0:43:10.770,0:43:16.410
daughters one of them well this is

0:43:14.250,0:43:17.910
better than the prelims it went really

0:43:16.410,0:43:23.970
over in the prelims this is just

0:43:17.910,0:43:25.230
slightly over but technically strong I

0:43:23.970,0:43:28.490
wonder if she'll be strong enough

0:43:25.230,0:43:31.050
eventually to do to no harm Tris

0:43:28.490,0:43:32.880
she's a great diver she's already proved

0:43:31.050,0:43:35.280
that show good resilience this morning

0:43:32.880,0:43:39.810
to come back from a bad start but that's

0:43:35.280,0:43:42.920
a good start better than the 64 marks

0:43:39.810,0:43:42.920
George award in good shape

0:43:42.950,0:43:48.980
[Applause]

0:43:46.220,0:43:51.780
Noemi back here there in 28 years of age

0:43:48.980,0:43:58.470
alongside Pocock cook the most

0:43:51.780,0:44:00.420
experienced athlete in this field she's

0:43:58.470,0:44:01.980
won this title before she's not gonna

0:44:00.420,0:44:03.570
win it again with dives like that I'm

0:44:01.980,0:44:07.980
afraid a poor forward three and a half

0:44:03.570,0:44:09.540
somersault opener she's really high well

0:44:07.980,0:44:11.730
it's the problem she's also jumped

0:44:09.540,0:44:14.280
forward so although she has come out

0:44:11.730,0:44:16.290
late from the pike Mike here is good but

0:44:14.280,0:44:18.690
she is traveling forwards hard to stop

0:44:16.290,0:44:20.490
the rotation and she reaches the wrong

0:44:18.690,0:44:23.190
part of the water needed reached more

0:44:20.490,0:44:25.819
forward towards the one metre boards on

0:44:23.190,0:44:29.959
the far side

0:44:25.819,0:44:32.329
just 45 marks from bat key and in this

0:44:29.959,0:44:34.309
sort of company you can't afford those

0:44:32.329,0:44:35.959
errors I talked about the fact that

0:44:34.309,0:44:39.890
there are going to be misses and it's by

0:44:35.959,0:44:42.729
how much you miss but 45 is probably too

0:44:39.890,0:44:45.499
too much she's gonna have to rely on

0:44:42.729,0:44:46.969
other athletes missing dives as well so

0:44:45.499,0:44:51.079
forward three and a half somersaults now

0:44:46.969,0:44:53.390
same dive from PG Cova of Russia the 19

0:44:51.079,0:44:56.420
year old coached by her synchro

0:44:53.390,0:45:00.949
partner's mother timber Shanina who saw

0:44:56.420,0:45:03.109
her daughter miss out in the prelims so

0:45:00.949,0:45:05.059
this is Russia's hope they'd say it's so

0:45:03.109,0:45:11.839
so it's not too bad entry but it was

0:45:05.059,0:45:14.900
very low so strong takeoff that was good

0:45:11.839,0:45:16.940
not traveling forwards just lining up in

0:45:14.900,0:45:19.069
front of the face going through the

0:45:16.940,0:45:21.259
water see see just the last minute the

0:45:19.069,0:45:24.709
feet kick she rolls under the water

0:45:21.259,0:45:29.829
brings some of it back a good jump at

0:45:24.709,0:45:29.829
the start this will be a decent Park

0:45:30.960,0:45:37.410
it's a good opener for her cheek over

0:45:33.510,0:45:42.830
and she has the lead by just a third of

0:45:37.410,0:45:45.890
a point from Ally Kalonji of France

0:45:42.830,0:45:48.110
two Germans to come next and always the

0:45:45.890,0:45:49.060
same in each rotation of these at five

0:45:48.110,0:45:52.910
rounds

0:45:49.060,0:45:57.320
Maria Kershaw already has a gold from

0:45:52.910,0:46:00.860
the synchro on the ten meter that's a

0:45:57.320,0:46:03.440
solid start from her nice entry good

0:46:00.860,0:46:04.730
forward three and a half there she did

0:46:03.440,0:46:08.900
something funny with her feet though

0:46:04.730,0:46:14.380
he's gonna throw the water good jump

0:46:08.900,0:46:17.240
spinning fast just the feet relaxing

0:46:14.380,0:46:19.450
right here which the judges will pick up

0:46:17.240,0:46:22.070
as she rolls her feet flattened

0:46:19.450,0:46:26.210
it's a shame she'll lose five six points

0:46:22.070,0:46:31.430
for that but another diver makes it into

0:46:26.210,0:46:36.740
the sixty points out George Oh at the

0:46:31.430,0:46:39.230
moment in fifth position doing very well

0:46:36.740,0:46:41.240
today to get through in third and fourth

0:46:39.230,0:46:44.840
but for Christine of us and this is

0:46:41.240,0:46:47.720
uncharted territory the student from

0:46:44.840,0:46:49.460
Berlin doesn't have any senior medals

0:46:47.720,0:46:51.170
yet in the European Championships could

0:46:49.460,0:46:54.380
today be the day inward three and a half

0:46:51.170,0:46:57.830
somersaults this is a big dive it was

0:46:54.380,0:46:59.660
the second highest scoring dive no it's

0:46:57.830,0:47:03.410
not gonna be far away again that's a

0:46:59.660,0:47:05.120
great start for Larson 75 points I think

0:47:03.410,0:47:09.880
the one in the prelims though the body

0:47:05.120,0:47:12.349
was just a little tighter springy jump

0:47:09.880,0:47:14.450
they're that small mistake everything

0:47:12.349,0:47:19.969
else though good squeeze in tight

0:47:14.450,0:47:23.180
spinning fast finishing high and it's

0:47:19.969,0:47:25.549
good in safe as well not too far or too

0:47:23.180,0:47:28.430
close 75

0:47:25.549,0:47:30.410
it's the final and the judges have gone

0:47:28.430,0:47:34.459
where they're brilliant diving from us

0:47:30.410,0:47:37.190
and and she opens once again with a 75

0:47:34.459,0:47:39.559
pointer to take the lead two divers to

0:47:37.190,0:47:43.029
come in round one luli apricot took the

0:47:39.559,0:47:46.700
defending champion looking to add a 5th

0:47:43.029,0:47:48.979
10 meter european championship gold to

0:47:46.700,0:47:57.079
her CV forward three and a half then in

0:47:48.979,0:48:00.529
the pipe position at 3.04 luleå it's a

0:47:57.079,0:48:03.830
much better start than the prelims the

0:48:00.529,0:48:06.410
prelims only got sixes

0:48:03.830,0:48:07.460
different pike she holds right down the

0:48:06.410,0:48:11.390
bottom of her legs

0:48:07.460,0:48:13.970
has that gag going around but she got

0:48:11.390,0:48:18.620
the tearing rip sound good stop

0:48:13.970,0:48:23.390
beautiful point little movement so

0:48:18.620,0:48:25.970
she'll get much higher than sixes 75 to

0:48:23.390,0:48:31.100
old leads for Germany and Christina

0:48:25.970,0:48:32.930
arson and just underneath that at 72 for

0:48:31.100,0:48:36.290
a lower degree of difficulty that's a

0:48:32.930,0:48:38.930
fine opener from to capture once again

0:48:36.290,0:48:42.200
the decibel level goes up here in the

0:48:38.930,0:48:44.240
London Aquatics Center Tonya couch the

0:48:42.200,0:48:46.820
26 year old from Plymouth coached by

0:48:44.240,0:48:49.490
Andy banks to open her account in this

0:48:46.820,0:48:51.260
final same dive that we've just seen

0:48:49.490,0:48:57.650
from pro cock cook so a little bit of

0:48:51.260,0:49:00.860
pressure on couch here and that's the

0:48:57.650,0:49:02.930
way to respond maybe not quite as good

0:49:00.860,0:49:04.880
on the entry as Prokop shock but that

0:49:02.930,0:49:07.000
will certainly get her off to a great

0:49:04.880,0:49:07.000
start

0:49:10.930,0:49:18.380
yes it had a little bit more splash I

0:49:14.380,0:49:20.800
think this was superior slightly flat

0:49:18.380,0:49:24.740
feet and then pointed again coming out

0:49:20.800,0:49:30.260
at the splash I spot the judges might

0:49:24.740,0:49:35.300
mark a downfall oh wow that was that is

0:49:30.260,0:49:38.240
a tough call for Tonya couch 61 500 not

0:49:35.300,0:49:40.190
the start that she was looking for but

0:49:38.240,0:49:42.380
we told you it'd be interesting it's the

0:49:40.190,0:49:44.090
youngster 17-year old Christine of arson

0:49:42.380,0:49:49.250
that leads at the moment we'll take a

0:49:44.090,0:49:51.200
break there round 2 of the woman's ten

0:49:49.250,0:49:52.820
meter final on day five here at the

0:49:51.200,0:49:55.160
European diving championships on

0:49:52.820,0:49:57.230
Eurosport armstand back to somersaults

0:49:55.160,0:49:59.590
with a half twist for Ally Kalonji of

0:49:57.230,0:49:59.590
France

0:50:00.790,0:50:05.349
nicely done she started this competition

0:50:03.320,0:50:11.079
on fire

0:50:05.349,0:50:13.359
in fourth place qualified in 12 that's a

0:50:11.079,0:50:15.729
half twist first and then into the pike

0:50:13.359,0:50:17.650
but wobbly though with a loose back

0:50:15.729,0:50:21.489
going through the water good at this

0:50:17.650,0:50:26.170
point arms lining up in front have any

0:50:21.489,0:50:27.969
splash that doesn't really squeeze the

0:50:26.170,0:50:30.400
ears with the arms and lock the body out

0:50:27.969,0:50:32.529
for a degree of difficulty if just two

0:50:30.400,0:50:35.619
point seven is always gonna be tough to

0:50:32.529,0:50:40.029
get yourself into the 60s but solid

0:50:35.619,0:50:43.719
diving from her now Laura Marano has

0:50:40.029,0:50:45.690
already made her mistake a big mess in

0:50:43.719,0:50:48.999
round one that's out of the way

0:50:45.690,0:50:51.819
she now needs four rounds of world-class

0:50:48.999,0:50:53.769
diving if she wants a shot at the medal

0:50:51.819,0:50:56.739
forward three and a half somersaults in

0:50:53.769,0:51:05.650
the pike position then in round two for

0:50:56.739,0:51:08.559
Marren oh yeah it's better they're just

0:51:05.650,0:51:10.690
a little loose on their entry again the

0:51:08.559,0:51:13.359
technique is good what we're looking for

0:51:10.690,0:51:17.170
is upright and then the first part of

0:51:13.359,0:51:18.449
the Summerson to move and then drop so

0:51:17.170,0:51:21.249
there she gets it

0:51:18.449,0:51:25.239
Pike is near-perfect the face very

0:51:21.249,0:51:26.859
cushions pulling in hard second or third

0:51:25.239,0:51:32.819
somersault faster than the first because

0:51:26.859,0:51:36.640
the pikes tighter 63 marks for Mara no

0:51:32.819,0:51:41.349
may enable her to advance a position or

0:51:36.640,0:51:43.930
two this Chris note said seventies is

0:51:41.349,0:51:45.459
where you need to be this evening if you

0:51:43.930,0:51:48.249
want to get in amongst the medals and

0:51:45.459,0:51:52.059
take that gold now and your army

0:51:48.249,0:51:54.309
the Lithuanian a really scary start for

0:51:52.059,0:51:56.109
her she got away with it so for three

0:51:54.309,0:52:01.299
and a half somersaults in round two

0:51:56.109,0:52:04.059
oh my goodness me and it's going from

0:52:01.299,0:52:06.219
bad to worse I'm afraid for the

0:52:04.059,0:52:08.739
Lithuanian that is a poor dive and it's

0:52:06.219,0:52:10.420
a painful one there so on the inwards

0:52:08.739,0:52:14.520
she caught it on face

0:52:10.420,0:52:17.460
now a whole of the back completely slaps

0:52:14.520,0:52:21.670
so she misses her spot this is good

0:52:17.460,0:52:25.299
lovely tuck position and miss is it

0:52:21.670,0:52:27.040
doesn't see the triple divers feel the

0:52:25.299,0:52:29.339
trip will come around then they look at

0:52:27.040,0:52:32.440
the water and then they reach for it and

0:52:29.339,0:52:36.099
she just stayed in there tuck still

0:52:32.440,0:52:39.309
smiling unbelievable and hasn't made it

0:52:36.099,0:52:45.190
to thirty points yet let's just hope for

0:52:39.309,0:52:49.450
her sake that things improve Selim von

0:52:45.190,0:52:50.829
donate for the Netherlands 2.8 for this

0:52:49.450,0:52:54.329
next round inward two-and-a-half

0:52:50.829,0:52:58.390
somersaults then this is the dive that

0:52:54.329,0:52:59.670
Kalonji really nailed first up in this

0:52:58.390,0:53:03.540
final for France

0:52:59.670,0:53:03.540
what can Celine do

0:53:07.380,0:53:13.440
I'm very grateful through the air it

0:53:10.930,0:53:15.759
looked if anything a little easy for her

0:53:13.440,0:53:18.819
that's because she did all the right

0:53:15.759,0:53:21.039
moments the throw was at the right time

0:53:18.819,0:53:23.829
you had to coordinate the throw with the

0:53:21.039,0:53:27.130
jump pulls it straight away so she was

0:53:23.829,0:53:28.569
into the pike as tight as you can be

0:53:27.130,0:53:31.269
right at the beginning some of the

0:53:28.569,0:53:37.089
divers take half a rotation to get in

0:53:31.269,0:53:39.250
there little splashy on the entry 58 806

0:53:37.089,0:53:46.690
lean Ronda and score ticking along

0:53:39.250,0:53:48.640
nicely it's nicely before Ukraine the 20

0:53:46.690,0:53:50.259
year old will be performing a forward

0:53:48.640,0:53:52.359
three and a half somersaults in the pike

0:53:50.259,0:53:57.190
position at 3.0 this is actually her

0:53:52.359,0:54:03.390
highest degree of difficulty it was a

0:53:57.190,0:54:05.319
best dive in the prelims just whistle

0:54:03.390,0:54:12.309
confirmation that she's good to go

0:54:05.319,0:54:15.250
and she's got it so in her own time no

0:54:12.309,0:54:17.019
mister that's washed over again so well

0:54:15.250,0:54:18.759
the pressure coming to bear that little

0:54:17.019,0:54:20.819
bit of additional adrenaline and it can

0:54:18.759,0:54:23.019
make a huge difference to the dives

0:54:20.819,0:54:25.690
sometimes when you tighten up in a

0:54:23.019,0:54:28.390
competition things just don't flow she

0:54:25.690,0:54:30.819
hit the end of the diving board and she

0:54:28.390,0:54:34.770
didn't throw in time so the momentum of

0:54:30.819,0:54:40.530
the job down the pole has taken her out

0:54:34.770,0:54:42.869
she misses her spot pikas okay it's been

0:54:40.530,0:54:49.890
quite a few misses now

0:54:42.869,0:54:49.890
fifty-two 504 off but not quite there

0:54:50.760,0:54:56.140
opportunities opening up left right and

0:54:53.529,0:54:58.839
center here can Georgia Ward take a

0:54:56.140,0:55:01.329
chance she's got the dive list a high

0:54:58.839,0:55:02.529
degree of difficulty to do it back three

0:55:01.329,0:55:04.569
and a half somersaults in the Tuck

0:55:02.529,0:55:08.549
position at three point three the

0:55:04.569,0:55:08.549
toughest dive in the competition

0:55:14.579,0:55:20.109
damn Georgia what a dive I knew that was

0:55:19.539,0:55:22.740
coming

0:55:20.109,0:55:25.599
the last two attempts she was gone short

0:55:22.740,0:55:26.650
and I'm sure I coaches said keep your

0:55:25.599,0:55:28.750
feet up

0:55:26.650,0:55:31.589
don't kick them back to waterfall she

0:55:28.750,0:55:35.009
did that it's a reach back

0:55:31.589,0:55:37.289
and with three point three this is gonna

0:55:35.009,0:55:41.839
be a phenomenal score at the moment the

0:55:37.289,0:55:45.119
highest score is been 75 in the prelims

0:55:41.839,0:55:48.689
can she go 80 that response from the

0:55:45.119,0:55:51.449
crowd massive and she has done 80 point

0:55:48.689,0:55:54.049
eight five puts George award in the hunt

0:55:51.449,0:55:54.049
for gold

0:55:58.100,0:56:05.670
Noemi back heat for Italy three times

0:56:03.150,0:56:10.410
silver medalists in this event in 10 12

0:56:05.670,0:56:13.020
14 but she also won it back in 2011 so

0:56:10.410,0:56:14.940
the platform has been kind to the

0:56:13.020,0:56:17.100
Italian it would three and a half

0:56:14.940,0:56:25.680
somersaults then round two to make up

0:56:17.100,0:56:27.780
for that miss in round one for that and

0:56:25.680,0:56:29.550
put everything into the entry there was

0:56:27.780,0:56:33.000
a booming sound that she goes through

0:56:29.550,0:56:33.950
the water and that suckers really tight

0:56:33.000,0:56:39.390
as well

0:56:33.950,0:56:42.030
squeezing Jim very closer than these and

0:56:39.390,0:56:47.520
the boom goes around the whole of the

0:56:42.030,0:56:51.660
poolside brilliant diving from back key

0:56:47.520,0:56:54.750
now we're cooking another 80 look at

0:56:51.660,0:56:58.500
that and back he goes to 125 for second

0:56:54.750,0:57:00.480
place behind George award and that is

0:56:58.500,0:57:02.300
the way to send the message out to the

0:57:00.480,0:57:06.120
rest of this field

0:57:02.300,0:57:07.860
ekaterina picture cover then next for

0:57:06.120,0:57:10.710
russia in with three and a half

0:57:07.860,0:57:13.560
somersaults for her at 3.2 sheet she has

0:57:10.710,0:57:16.200
got a tough dive list as well everything

0:57:13.560,0:57:17.850
in the threes and she does the three

0:57:16.200,0:57:24.120
point three in the next round

0:57:17.850,0:57:26.940
oh it's great diving and it's

0:57:24.120,0:57:29.619
competition Chris has come alive these

0:57:26.940,0:57:31.930
are world-class dives

0:57:29.619,0:57:34.029
as we said in the earlier competitions

0:57:31.930,0:57:36.339
though the standard is high its Olympic

0:57:34.029,0:57:40.650
here everyone's been preparing very hard

0:57:36.339,0:57:43.539
since last September and he can see it

0:57:40.650,0:57:46.119
just a little sproule on the entry

0:57:43.539,0:57:52.450
that's bit of splash it's still good

pan in the 10 metre synchro competition

0:58:07.960,0:58:11.920
but that was a little unexpected and in

0:58:09.819,0:58:16.769
the end the medal came due to some

0:58:11.920,0:58:19.660
misses by other teams but she'll take it

0:58:16.769,0:58:24.190

studying as a lon psychology student and

0:58:24.190,0:58:30.220

[Applause]

taxes a one three nine eight oh five

0:59:07.110,0:59:16.680
point oh five off of the pace set at the

0:59:10.680,0:59:18.540
moment by the bridge or award Christine

0:59:16.680,0:59:20.640
of us and will always follow her job in

0:59:18.540,0:59:23.640
every round lovely start from the

0:59:20.640,0:59:24.120
seventeen-year-old another 75 would do

0:59:23.640,0:59:28.890
nicely

0:59:24.120,0:59:30.990
oh and it's not gonna happen there's the

0:59:28.890,0:59:33.900
mistake from worse and then washes it

0:59:30.990,0:59:36.420
over exactly the same as the prelims she

0:59:33.900,0:59:38.790
hangs onto the pipe too long the feet go

0:59:36.420,0:59:42.060
up to the 10-meter and over on her

0:59:38.790,0:59:44.970
stomach needs to be out now she's still

0:59:42.060,0:59:48.240
in the pike and she finished something

0:59:44.970,0:59:50.130
like five and a half meters there and

0:59:48.240,0:59:54.690
see the five meter boulders she's coming

0:59:50.130,0:59:57.150
out on to the wrong place tough break

0:59:54.690,0:59:59.430
for us sent thirty point four five

0:59:57.150,1:00:07.380
dumpster down to ninth place with two

0:59:59.430,1:00:10.440
still to come true Lily apricot check in

1:00:07.380,1:00:13.230
second position behind kawasan with her

1:00:10.440,1:00:14.490
seventy pointer in the first round much

1:00:13.230,1:00:16.230
better start than she made in the

1:00:14.490,1:00:18.120
prelims in with three and a half in the

1:00:16.230,1:00:24.800
tuck position now high degree of

1:00:18.120,1:00:27.510
difficulty looking for the big score yet

1:00:24.800,1:00:29.780
enormous score that's a fabulous dive

1:00:27.510,1:00:32.660
she's so high this is

1:00:29.780,1:00:36.460
hard died and she had so much time at

1:00:32.660,1:00:39.160
the end double there now she finished

1:00:36.460,1:00:42.920
above the five meter

1:00:39.160,1:00:46.750
we've already had 280 dives this is on

1:00:42.920,1:00:46.750
the same par who's George award

1:00:48.400,1:00:54.890
astonishing stuff in round 2 eights

1:00:50.750,1:00:57.560
another 1881 six outputs Brokaw took in

1:00:54.890,1:01:00.050
the lead so she will move ahead of

1:00:57.560,1:01:02.800
George award by eight point seven five

1:01:00.050,1:01:02.800
points

1:01:02.980,1:01:13.430
talk about pressure for Tonya couch blew

1:01:08.990,1:01:15.200
everyone away for most of the prelim at

1:01:13.430,1:01:18.230
an error at the end which led a few

1:01:15.200,1:01:20.569
athletes get closer to her but came into

1:01:18.230,1:01:23.000
this competition as the marginal

1:01:20.569,1:01:23.450
favorite and has to produce some magic

1:01:23.000,1:01:29.089
here

1:01:23.450,1:01:35.480
um stand back twister then she's in

1:01:29.089,1:01:39.400
business best rounds I've seen that

1:01:35.480,1:01:39.400
Europeans for a long long time

1:01:40.530,1:01:48.420
nails it among the highest score is 81.6

1:01:46.160,1:01:51.710
well our feet were better than the

1:01:48.420,1:01:59.580
prelims so this is going to be massive

1:01:51.710,1:02:02.400
yes it's gonna be 18 oh it's 86.4 back

1:01:59.580,1:02:05.310
in the second position at 147 9 oh and

1:02:02.400,1:02:12.030
just five points down on lowly apricot

1:02:05.310,1:02:14.640
Chuck what a competition a simple dive

1:02:12.030,1:02:17.220
for Alea Kalonji you'll see it on the

1:02:14.640,1:02:19.800
replay but unfortunately she has

1:02:17.220,1:02:22.290
problems with the reverse dive family

1:02:19.800,1:02:24.420
and has to stick to that a very simple

1:02:22.290,1:02:27.060
dive at 1.9 she's done it beautifully

1:02:24.420,1:02:29.610
again she has but because that load

1:02:27.060,1:02:33.600
degree difficulty all come up has a very

1:02:29.610,1:02:35.700
low score somewhere around 40 points she

1:02:33.600,1:02:37.350
would have gone even high over the score

1:02:35.700,1:02:41.790
she hadn't had that drift over at the

1:02:37.350,1:02:43.920
end 39 I know for Kalonji and that's the

1:02:41.790,1:02:46.560
dive that he's always gonna cause us

1:02:43.920,1:02:49.380
some problems until she builds some high

1:02:46.560,1:02:51.810
degree of difficulty in well Laura

1:02:49.380,1:02:53.250
Moreno must be wondering what they what

1:02:51.810,1:02:56.340
on earth is going on in this competition

1:02:53.250,1:02:59.790
because it's all happening around it has

1:02:56.340,1:03:01.800
not found a good dive as yet the French

1:02:59.790,1:03:06.060
woman who finished in second place in

1:03:01.800,1:03:07.770
2015 in Rostock and she would dearly

1:03:06.060,1:03:08.850
love to come to the party in round 3

1:03:07.770,1:03:11.540
with this back two and a half

1:03:08.850,1:03:11.540
somersaults

1:03:15.360,1:03:23.400
oh why not why not another brilliant

1:03:18.960,1:03:25.410
entry well maybe this is gonna be the

1:03:23.400,1:03:27.660
round where she starts to pick up good

1:03:25.410,1:03:32.100
jump looking with her head you can see

1:03:27.660,1:03:33.990
them head moving she looks at the end

1:03:32.100,1:03:37.520
the board sees it looks at the Walter

1:03:33.990,1:03:42.660
sees it reaches back and sees it and

1:03:37.520,1:03:44.880
disappears yes what a lovely way of

1:03:42.660,1:03:46.770
describing the process that the divers

1:03:44.880,1:03:48.690
going through Chris brilliant and that's

1:03:46.770,1:03:52.110
a good score seventy three nine five

1:03:48.690,1:03:54.240
four Laura Marano a little collision

1:03:52.110,1:03:56.310
with the camera operator but she's happy

1:03:54.240,1:03:59.880
wouldn't have been smiling if she got a

1:03:56.310,1:04:01.290
40 I can tell you now Genevieve and your

1:03:59.880,1:04:04.740
army keep your fingers crossed

1:04:01.290,1:04:12.690
Friday the 13th is a day that at the

1:04:04.740,1:04:15.210
moment she would prefer to forget no

1:04:12.690,1:04:16.700
it's it's still not happening I'm afraid

1:04:15.210,1:04:19.440
for Genevieve

1:04:16.700,1:04:22.830
well for the first three quarters of the

1:04:19.440,1:04:24.360
dive it's fine good jump spots well on

1:04:22.830,1:04:26.580
the first somersault but she doesn't

1:04:24.360,1:04:29.310
pick up the second spot here it's good

1:04:26.580,1:04:30.990
but right here she's looking in the

1:04:29.310,1:04:33.990
wrong place she should have seen the

1:04:30.990,1:04:38.210
water and then pushed the feet out she

1:04:33.990,1:04:38.210
leaves it too late it's gone over

1:04:38.350,1:04:43.750
well the smile once again

1:04:40.990,1:04:47.300
but it's looking a little tired now

1:04:43.750,1:04:50.200
33:35 still only managing to get to 62

1:04:47.300,1:04:53.210
marks of the three rounds of diving

1:04:50.200,1:04:55.010
sleeve and oh and then for three and a

1:04:53.210,1:05:01.369
half somersaults in the pike position at

1:04:55.010,1:05:04.970
3.0 diving well but the class around

1:05:01.369,1:05:06.740
here from some of the big names at the

1:05:04.970,1:05:11.330
moment eclipsing anything that she's

1:05:06.740,1:05:15.980
managed to do around three needs to be

1:05:11.330,1:05:18.260
big for the Dutch woman it's a good dive

1:05:15.980,1:05:20.950
little bit of a depth charge going up

1:05:18.260,1:05:24.890
after the entry but she'll take that

1:05:20.950,1:05:27.350
yeah this is correct she jumps up one in

1:05:24.890,1:05:29.090
prelim jumped forward but as she's

1:05:27.350,1:05:31.160
coming out the hole of the middle of her

1:05:29.090,1:05:34.000
body is low she's not holding the

1:05:31.160,1:05:37.460
stomach tight then that goes loose and

1:05:34.000,1:05:40.190
the water then hits you and you bonk

1:05:37.460,1:05:43.330
your body concertinas and that's why

1:05:40.190,1:05:43.330
this flash has come up

1:05:43.690,1:05:52.680
[Music]

1:05:46.960,1:05:55.150
still waiting for that mark than 58 500

1:05:52.680,1:05:56.980
that's as bad as it gets

1:05:55.150,1:05:59.530
then it's not gonna be too bad for

1:05:56.980,1:06:01.150
Celine Van doing but in this kind of

1:05:59.530,1:06:02.309
company at the moment it isn't good

1:06:01.150,1:06:06.940
enough

1:06:02.309,1:06:10.000
that's knowledge then next position

1:06:06.940,1:06:11.950
after two rounds forward twister so two

1:06:10.000,1:06:13.329
and half somersaults then with a single

1:06:11.950,1:06:18.180
twist let's see where she puts the

1:06:13.329,1:06:18.180
twists in to this particular dive

1:06:22.150,1:06:26.060
so the twist straight away and then

1:06:24.410,1:06:31.250
pulls into the somersaults and a nice

1:06:26.060,1:06:34.910
entry yeah just a small jump forwards

1:06:31.250,1:06:37.850
yeah she landed on the board a body bent

1:06:34.910,1:06:41.330
forward there and as she strained down

1:06:37.850,1:06:43.610
rather than forwards get some good entry

1:06:41.330,1:06:45.320
though just a little bit sloppy on those

1:06:43.610,1:06:49.390
at the start and just going into the

1:06:45.320,1:06:49.390
pike but have a little deeper pike

1:06:49.440,1:06:59.020
once again coach even encode comes

1:06:52.780,1:07:01.410
across rich at 60.9 Oh especially giving

1:06:59.020,1:07:04.140
a good account of herself

1:07:01.410,1:07:06.330
now George award you get the feeling

1:07:04.140,1:07:08.400
actually that it was Georgia that really

1:07:06.330,1:07:11.490
kicked this competition into life in

1:07:08.400,1:07:14.340
round two absolutely nailed her back

1:07:11.490,1:07:15.840
three and a half went into the lead and

1:07:14.340,1:07:18.870
everybody found it difficult to work

1:07:15.840,1:07:21.390
live with her from there so arm stand

1:07:18.870,1:07:25.760
back to somersaults with one and a half

1:07:21.390,1:07:28.620
twists for Georgia Ward in our home Paul

1:07:25.760,1:07:37.200
another good dive here and she is

1:07:28.620,1:07:38.940
definitely in business superb that

1:07:37.200,1:07:41.010
little separation of the legs as she

1:07:38.940,1:07:42.960
came away from the platform but got it

1:07:41.010,1:07:46.230
all back together yeah it's so minor

1:07:42.960,1:07:48.330
though it's not going to affect the

1:07:46.230,1:07:50.280
judges score the loose body going

1:07:48.330,1:07:50.700
through the water will drop her down low

1:07:50.280,1:07:53.940
of it

1:07:50.700,1:07:56.430
she went 67 points in the prelim this is

1:07:53.940,1:07:58.230
just about the same dive very good in

1:07:56.430,1:08:02.130
the air its splashy going through the

1:07:58.230,1:08:03.600
water so be a sinless 467 points will

1:08:02.130,1:08:07.170
keep her on track and that's where she

1:08:03.600,1:08:10.110
is 67 204 two hundred and twelve oh five

1:08:07.170,1:08:13.619
Ward moves back into the lead

1:08:10.110,1:08:13.619
[Applause]

1:08:13.690,1:08:21.790
do I be back key then form a Hungarian

1:08:17.660,1:08:25.940
diver that moved to Italy back in 2005

1:08:21.790,1:08:31.250
coached by mommy ball janosh the 1992

1:08:25.940,1:08:32.900
Olympian from Barcelona has been superb

1:08:31.250,1:08:35.650
in this competition in previous years

1:08:32.900,1:08:42.080
but isn't happening for at the moment

1:08:35.650,1:08:43.790
verse two and a half then follow me how

1:08:42.080,1:08:46.490
high did she go up the platform there

1:08:43.790,1:08:48.170
and always in control she didn't hold

1:08:46.490,1:08:50.359
back she's standing there she thought

1:08:48.170,1:08:55.549
about it she visualized it and then she

1:08:50.359,1:08:57.710
jumped she was kicking out seven and a

1:08:55.549,1:09:01.400
half meters a double here seven five

1:08:57.710,1:09:03.770
meters kick she floats around for six

1:09:01.400,1:09:07.299
meters there's the seven meter right

1:09:03.770,1:09:11.089
next to her and then she reaches back

1:09:07.299,1:09:13.310
dive into the 70s and remember that's a

1:09:11.089,1:09:16.640
lower degree of difficulty at two point

1:09:13.310,1:09:22.609
eight so that score is fabulous and mum

1:09:16.640,1:09:26.750
is happy Katarina perchick over then in

1:09:22.609,1:09:30.680
fifth position at the moment sometimes

1:09:26.750,1:09:34.310
in the shadow of her synchro partner Tim

1:09:30.680,1:09:36.230
Lucia Nina has a chance to shine here

1:09:34.310,1:09:38.120
because tamesha Nina failed to get

1:09:36.230,1:09:40.430
through the prelims so back three and a

1:09:38.120,1:09:45.770
half this is her toughest dive the equal

1:09:40.430,1:09:48.589
toughest dive in the competition oh it's

1:09:45.770,1:09:50.350
a nasty one so again another big miss

1:09:48.589,1:09:52.640
and this time it's from the Russian

1:09:50.350,1:09:55.640
missed it in the Prius only scored

1:09:52.640,1:09:58.520
40-something points on it the jump is

1:09:55.640,1:10:00.349
good mates spinning too slow she hangs

1:09:58.520,1:10:04.159
on as long as possible

1:10:00.349,1:10:05.900
and then goes over it's not accelerating

1:10:04.159,1:10:09.230
it's just dropping like a stone and

1:10:05.900,1:10:13.159
barely time to come out she'll be lucky

1:10:09.230,1:10:16.310
to get 40 on this one it was even worse

1:10:13.159,1:10:20.389
than the prelim yeah it's just 37 9 5

1:10:16.310,1:10:22.670
then for Pacheco but a real shame for

1:10:20.389,1:10:25.070
her and that's probably the metal

1:10:22.670,1:10:25.760
challenge done for the Russian but Never

1:10:25.070,1:10:27.320
Say Never

1:10:25.760,1:10:30.380
anything can happen we're platform

1:10:27.320,1:10:33.889
diving is concerned and it did in the

1:10:30.380,1:10:36.920
prelims few big names missing out a few

1:10:33.889,1:10:40.239
big names nearly missing out because

1:10:36.920,1:10:43.099
you're then the 27 year old German

1:10:40.239,1:10:48.020
trains in Berlin coach my young coach

1:10:43.099,1:10:50.719
Marc and that's really nice but on a day

1:10:48.020,1:10:52.159
she's a very tidy very efficient diver

1:10:50.719,1:10:56.540
and that's what she's bringing to this

1:10:52.159,1:10:58.909
final yes in finished in 12th place last

1:10:56.540,1:11:03.500
year but she's got three bronze medals

1:10:58.909,1:11:05.960
in this event from 1112 and 2013 it was

1:11:03.500,1:11:08.719
a good dive it's a lower degree of

1:11:05.960,1:11:10.340
difficulty I was watching her toes as

1:11:08.719,1:11:13.040
she passed the born it was just about

1:11:10.340,1:11:17.030
safe enough any closer and she would

1:11:13.040,1:11:20.719
have touched solid score 60 point 2-0 to

1:11:17.030,1:11:22.499
reach the 200 mark after three rounds of

1:11:20.719,1:11:26.130
five

1:11:22.499,1:11:32.219
slightly disconsolate from crostino

1:11:26.130,1:11:33.840
arson she went from first to 11th and

1:11:32.219,1:11:36.989
that's not gonna keep anyone happy

1:11:33.840,1:11:38.909
so vas an arm stand ID for her arm stand

1:11:36.989,1:11:41.489
back to somersaults one and a half

1:11:38.909,1:11:44.550
twists and that gives her a degree of

1:11:41.489,1:11:47.579
difficulty of three point two so this is

1:11:44.550,1:11:49.440
the kind of dive if she gets the entry

1:11:47.579,1:11:57.269
that she was getting in the prelims that

1:11:49.440,1:12:00.090
could put a back in contention it's good

1:11:57.269,1:12:02.190
it's good but it's not gonna push her up

1:12:00.090,1:12:03.690
too far on the leaderboard there's a

1:12:02.190,1:12:05.510
better handstand this time in the

1:12:03.690,1:12:09.389
prelims she didn't get to that

1:12:05.510,1:12:11.909
completely straight position now she is

1:12:09.389,1:12:15.719
just twisting all the way down to the

1:12:11.909,1:12:19.229
pool but it's an entry it's gonna score

1:12:15.719,1:12:20.789
really well technique isn't that

1:12:19.229,1:12:24.360
brilliant off the platform not enough

1:12:20.789,1:12:26.940
jump and the twist took so long to get

1:12:24.360,1:12:29.670
into 70 point four oh then takes it to

1:12:26.940,1:12:36.599
170 6:05 so she will improve her

1:12:29.670,1:12:37.320
position from eleventh ninth just a

1:12:36.599,1:12:39.860
reminder

1:12:37.320,1:12:44.729
Georgia Ward leads for Great Britain on

1:12:39.860,1:12:50.210
212 oh five pro cock cook and her

1:12:44.729,1:12:50.210
compatriot Tonya couch can get past her

1:12:52.170,1:12:56.800
and we're diving like this the defense

1:12:54.969,1:12:59.830
of her title is starting to look very

1:12:56.800,1:13:05.580
very good indeed that's a great dive on

1:12:59.830,1:13:07.989
that back to an R what a jump spots just

1:13:05.580,1:13:13.270
collapses a little bit going through the

1:13:07.989,1:13:16.600
water here it's good reaches back she

1:13:13.270,1:13:22.260
knows needs only 58 points to go into

1:13:16.600,1:13:22.260
the lead she'll get that

1:13:22.890,1:13:29.660
and the four-time European ten meter

1:13:25.740,1:13:33.800
champion moves back in the top spot to

1:13:29.660,1:13:37.850
2175 so that's a nine point seven

1:13:33.800,1:13:41.400
advantage over Georgia Ward in second

1:13:37.850,1:13:44.910
21.7 advantage over Maria Cujo in third

1:13:41.400,1:13:46.710
and Tonya couch has got this tough

1:13:44.910,1:13:48.750
position the pressure keeps passing down

1:13:46.710,1:13:55.650
inward three and a half then for Tonya

1:13:48.750,1:14:00.030
at three point two and she will keep

1:13:55.650,1:14:01.350
pace with that dive 73 points to go and

1:14:00.030,1:14:03.720
laid on I'm not quite sure with that

1:14:01.350,1:14:07.680
entry she pulls the chin down on the end

1:14:03.720,1:14:10.560
and but that starts good finishes high

1:14:07.680,1:14:12.410
but just lost it on the entry neither

1:14:10.560,1:14:16.080
had the confidence to keep stretching

1:14:12.410,1:14:19.020
she pushes here and you see the arms are

1:14:16.080,1:14:20.120
out of line so the judges will mark her

1:14:19.020,1:14:23.880
down for that

1:14:20.120,1:14:26.490
so probably sub 70 but by how much you

1:14:23.880,1:14:28.710
are just under five points so Tonya

1:14:26.490,1:14:31.410
couch does move into second at 2:13

1:14:28.710,1:14:33.150
five-o just ahead of Georgia Ward but

1:14:31.410,1:14:37.590
it's the defending champion Procop cook

1:14:33.150,1:14:40.170
that leads back just in time for another

1:14:37.590,1:14:43.050
rep entry this time from Laura Meredith

1:14:40.170,1:14:45.270
the French number one after that arm

1:14:43.050,1:14:49.200
stand back to somersaults and one and a

1:14:45.270,1:14:52.230
half twists another lovely entry using

1:14:49.200,1:14:54.840
the bend knee to flick off a lot of the

1:14:52.230,1:14:57.480
ladies are just cleaning off it smile

1:14:54.840,1:15:00.780
like that technique gets a little bit of

1:14:57.480,1:15:03.120
extra rotation and a fast twist but it's

1:15:00.780,1:15:07.560
a the entry little splash that's given

1:15:03.120,1:15:10.230
under 73 points ok moves to 260 15 after

1:15:07.560,1:15:11.940
that 73 6-0 so a couple of good rounds

1:15:10.230,1:15:15.450
there from Laura Marano

1:15:11.940,1:15:17.430
and she's kinda back in business but

1:15:15.450,1:15:18.750
needs to keep it at the highest possible

1:15:17.430,1:15:19.950
level if she's gonna be in with a shout

1:15:18.750,1:15:23.370
of a place on the podium

1:15:19.950,1:15:25.620
now come on Genevieve seventeen-year-old

1:15:23.370,1:15:30.090
from Lithuania Reverse two and a half

1:15:25.620,1:15:33.000
somersaults needs an entry needs to get

1:15:30.090,1:15:35.610
some confidence back

1:15:33.000,1:15:37.590
and it's just not gonna happen fallout

1:15:35.610,1:15:39.270
her this evening and you sometimes get

1:15:37.590,1:15:40.740
competitions like this Chris it doesn't

1:15:39.270,1:15:43.530
matter what you do it doesn't work

1:15:40.740,1:15:45.120
sometimes when you've got experience if

1:15:43.530,1:15:46.710
you're spinning at a different rate in

1:15:45.120,1:15:48.840
the competition you know to make

1:15:46.710,1:15:50.880
adjustments and that's what's happened

1:15:48.840,1:15:52.980
here she's jumped a little higher than

1:15:50.880,1:15:55.140
normal she's spinning faster than normal

1:15:52.980,1:15:57.030
but she's done the same kick out that

1:15:55.140,1:15:59.280
she would do in practice and that is why

1:15:57.030,1:16:01.950
she's gone over the extra gentleman she

1:15:59.280,1:16:03.870
hasn't taken into account it still a

1:16:01.950,1:16:06.390
high school student back in the USA but

1:16:03.870,1:16:09.690
retained her Lithuanian passport when

1:16:06.390,1:16:12.900
she moved there at two years of age and

1:16:09.690,1:16:16.320
has to put this one down to experience

1:16:12.900,1:16:20.130
I'm afraid this evening Selene valuing

1:16:16.320,1:16:24.240
has died very well and seventh the best

1:16:20.130,1:16:26.460
that she can manage at the moment this

1:16:24.240,1:16:28.350
then her joint toughest dive arm stand

1:16:26.460,1:16:31.170
back to somersaults with one and a half

1:16:28.350,1:16:33.620
twists so like her back twister in the

1:16:31.170,1:16:36.480
first round it's worth three point two

1:16:33.620,1:16:40.010
in terms of degree of difficulty is this

1:16:36.480,1:16:40.010
the dive that puts her back in business

1:16:43.070,1:16:49.230
not quite I'm afraid again just going

1:16:46.080,1:16:52.620
over on the end judges will certainly

1:16:49.230,1:16:54.960
deduct for that yeah not only did she

1:16:52.620,1:16:57.410
lean but she had the bent knee flick

1:16:54.960,1:17:00.330
which just gave her a little too much

1:16:57.410,1:17:02.760
rotation when she pikes down she

1:17:00.330,1:17:05.340
couldn't stop it digs their head in as

1:17:02.760,1:17:08.060
well actually accelerated those legs

1:17:05.340,1:17:08.060
going over

1:17:09.679,1:17:16.969
fifty-two a doe it is a Miss if I'm

1:17:14.330,1:17:19.960
doing will not be able to recover from

1:17:16.969,1:17:25.540
that so that's her metal challenge done

1:17:19.960,1:17:28.760
hand across nicely today for Ukraine

1:17:25.540,1:17:31.070
again dive very solidly but in this kind

1:17:28.760,1:17:34.420
of company paint the position the best

1:17:31.070,1:17:34.420
that she can manage at the moment

1:17:34.989,1:17:42.969
unlikely to match her fifth place from

1:17:38.150,1:17:42.969
2015 which was a brilliant performance

1:17:49.690,1:17:54.620
no it's very strange start to that back

1:17:52.640,1:17:57.860
two and a half yeah she keeps her knees

1:17:54.620,1:18:00.860
bent so right here a legs are bent and

1:17:57.860,1:18:02.840
then she finally straightens up those

1:18:00.860,1:18:06.830
legs for the second part of the diet but

1:18:02.840,1:18:08.330
that's an untidy Pike there here doesn't

1:18:06.830,1:18:10.460
spot the water that looks to me more

1:18:08.330,1:18:12.440
like a guest rather than using your eyes

1:18:10.460,1:18:17.410
to see where to come around where to

1:18:12.440,1:18:17.410
come out and she's going right over

1:18:17.510,1:18:25.159
to 19900 that rolling score and that's a

1:18:22.519,1:18:29.840
Miss of 43 five-oh Laura Marano leads

1:18:25.159,1:18:33.710
for France then on to 61 5 George award

1:18:29.840,1:18:37.610
will be looking to go past her and by

1:18:33.710,1:18:39.320
some distance with this fourth round eye

1:18:37.610,1:18:41.179
forward three and a half somersaults in

1:18:39.320,1:18:44.829
the pike position then her lowest degree

1:18:41.179,1:18:44.829
of difficulty this needs to be perfect

1:18:45.400,1:18:50.469
and again just washes over at the end

1:18:48.289,1:18:53.989
I'll she'll be frustrated with that

1:18:50.469,1:18:59.150
that's a real shame she only needed 48

1:18:53.989,1:19:01.670
points to go in the lead why she's got

1:18:59.150,1:19:05.949
such a good takeoff here pause him well

1:19:01.670,1:19:05.949
there needed to be out already

1:19:07.239,1:19:14.280
yeah now shift now their entry she's

1:19:12.079,1:19:17.420
getting an extra 15 points

1:19:14.280,1:19:20.969
oh yeah coach Figueredo watching on and

1:19:17.420,1:19:22.710
57 gives her the lead at 260 905 but

1:19:20.969,1:19:25.860
it's not the kind of advancement that

1:19:22.710,1:19:27.929
she was looking for we've had his George

1:19:25.860,1:19:31.409
Awards miss then okay she'll probably

1:19:27.929,1:19:38.010
take that one big dive to come in the

1:19:31.409,1:19:42.270
final round for her for knowing me back

1:19:38.010,1:19:46.050
key so far this has not been her

1:19:42.270,1:19:48.150
European Championships fifth position at

1:19:46.050,1:19:51.059
the moment so outside the medals but

1:19:48.150,1:19:56.190
still has the degree of difficulty to

1:19:51.059,1:19:59.599
force away onto the podium you need 70

1:19:56.190,1:19:59.599
points to catch George award

1:20:04.560,1:20:09.250
and that just was one of those classic

1:20:07.030,1:20:11.290
arms stand dives where the diver just

1:20:09.250,1:20:13.660
falls straight off the platform and into

1:20:11.290,1:20:16.449
the water she needs to go back in the

1:20:13.660,1:20:18.190
gym to work on this to get the timing

1:20:16.449,1:20:21.660
she just hasn't got the timing and

1:20:18.190,1:20:21.660
that's why it looks so awkward

1:20:24.290,1:20:31.890
as a Miss for her you can see how low

1:20:28.260,1:20:33.810
she finishes to the water not a great

1:20:31.890,1:20:37.170
dive to watch not a great score to get

1:20:33.810,1:20:39.380
54 for 0 bank his challenge falters

1:20:37.170,1:20:39.380
again

1:20:43.909,1:20:50.540
and Katerina Petrova one miss too many

1:20:47.860,1:20:53.239
and she's down in tenth position but in

1:20:50.540,1:20:57.969
this kind of competition and in this

1:20:53.239,1:20:57.969
kind of company one miss is too many

1:20:58.600,1:21:05.449
slightly different arm stand position

1:21:01.610,1:21:07.310
here facing the port with her back for

1:21:05.449,1:21:15.590
this two somersaults single twist at

1:21:07.310,1:21:17.389
three point one unusual dive this what

1:21:15.590,1:21:18.739
both she and Timothy Nina have the same

1:21:17.389,1:21:19.639
technique for the push off and it's

1:21:18.739,1:21:22.190
really effective

1:21:19.639,1:21:25.520
yeah the hips go first and then the feet

1:21:22.190,1:21:28.010
flick so there's the hips and then the

1:21:25.520,1:21:32.540
flip then the single twist and look at

1:21:28.010,1:21:34.550
the water there's a good technique maybe

1:21:32.540,1:21:37.010
just bending the arms a little too much

1:21:34.550,1:21:40.699
you only have to help relax your arms

1:21:37.010,1:21:43.610
rather than bend them right down it's

1:21:40.699,1:21:46.370
actually quite complicated diet

1:21:43.610,1:21:49.850
and that's a good score sixty-eight to

1:21:46.370,1:21:52.630
zero takes it a to 4405 so partial

1:21:49.850,1:21:56.840
recovery once again from perchick over

1:21:52.630,1:21:58.700
now Chris you think Maria Cujo could be

1:21:56.840,1:22:01.610
the danger back two and half somersaults

1:21:58.700,1:22:04.540
from her in the pike position yeah she

1:22:01.610,1:22:07.670
only needs 69 points to take the lead

1:22:04.540,1:22:12.320
and she went she actually missed this

1:22:07.670,1:22:14.120
dive in the prelims and he got 56 she's

1:22:12.320,1:22:18.890
got to remember to come out in time not

1:22:14.120,1:22:21.590
let the dive go over Iceland over has

1:22:18.890,1:22:24.710
done it again say almost carbon copy of

1:22:21.590,1:22:26.300
the prelims you should be able to make

1:22:24.710,1:22:28.220
an adjustment in the prelims if you're

1:22:26.300,1:22:29.840
gonna go short you have the same sort of

1:22:28.220,1:22:33.380
pressure because you wanted to make the

1:22:29.840,1:22:36.560
top 12 you need to remember to come out

1:22:33.380,1:22:39.440
early looks at the water too late it's

1:22:36.560,1:22:41.830
by pasture and out too late so right

1:22:39.440,1:22:41.830
over

1:22:42.040,1:22:49.410
[Music]

1:22:44.480,1:22:51.300
4205 and that miss I'm afraid he's going

1:22:49.410,1:22:56.270
to put the lid on cujo's challenge and

1:22:51.300,1:22:59.670
less others miss around her for Vasan

1:22:56.270,1:23:03.960
same situation as Kershaw except her

1:22:59.670,1:23:06.210
miss occurred on the last dive service

1:23:03.960,1:23:07.650
and trying to repair the damage with

1:23:06.210,1:23:13.530
this forward three and a half

1:23:07.650,1:23:15.480
somersaults in the pipe position that's

1:23:13.530,1:23:18.510
more like the entries we saw from her in

1:23:15.480,1:23:20.940
the prelims there's amazing that she

1:23:18.510,1:23:22.650
could get down with no splash even with

1:23:20.940,1:23:24.900
the dive going over so it's going to

1:23:22.650,1:23:29.000
score well yes you attach the end of the

1:23:24.900,1:23:31.830
diving board pulling him well here again

1:23:29.000,1:23:33.450
the technique of holding down on the

1:23:31.830,1:23:36.930
lower part of the ledge rather than

1:23:33.450,1:23:38.570
round the back of the knees it doesn't

1:23:36.930,1:23:41.280
matter if you get an entry like that

1:23:38.570,1:23:44.310
good awareness good scoop under the

1:23:41.280,1:23:46.590
water to save that dive and that's a

1:23:44.310,1:23:49.110
good score sixty-seven five oh it's

1:23:46.590,1:23:51.810
worse and temporarily up to fifth

1:23:49.110,1:23:56.670
position with two divers still to come

1:23:51.810,1:23:58.620
in this round I'm stand back three

1:23:56.670,1:24:00.960
somersaults in the tuck position four

1:23:58.620,1:24:02.670
luleå prokop cook for the joint highest

1:24:00.960,1:24:05.700
degree of difficulty in the competition

1:24:02.670,1:24:07.350
at three point three this is the big

1:24:05.700,1:24:09.420
dive for her Chris if she gets this

1:24:07.350,1:24:11.700
right gold and defense of her title is

1:24:09.420,1:24:14.400
on it's only a seventy five point nine

1:24:11.700,1:24:17.300
in the prelims she only needs 48 points

1:24:14.400,1:24:17.300
to go ahead of Georgia

1:24:20.710,1:24:25.730
all right beautiful from procore Church

1:24:23.540,1:24:28.460
she has not missed a beat this evening

1:24:25.730,1:24:33.790
well as she gets 8 which is worth it's

1:24:28.460,1:24:36.620
going to be 75 again strong kick-out oh

1:24:33.790,1:24:39.920
this is even better than the prelims

1:24:36.620,1:24:42.830
look sharp kick reaches back tightens

1:24:39.920,1:24:44.750
her body quicksave under the water stops

1:24:42.830,1:24:47.030
the feet kicking over that's the way to

1:24:44.750,1:24:49.010
go through she's always known what she's

1:24:47.030,1:24:51.860
doing she saw that triple somersault for

1:24:49.010,1:24:54.199
about four meters up Chris node loved it

1:24:51.860,1:24:59.090
but more importantly the judges loved it

1:24:54.199,1:25:01.969
84 won five takes her over 300 305 900

1:24:59.090,1:25:04.520
leads she's just put 36 points between

1:25:01.969,1:25:07.280
her and Jorge award in second place and

1:25:04.520,1:25:10.730
she's done it again she's passed all the

1:25:07.280,1:25:14.420
pressure down the line to the 26 year

1:25:10.730,1:25:17.630
old Brit Tonya couch back twister them

1:25:14.420,1:25:24.590
for Tonya at 3.2 just to stay in touch

1:25:17.630,1:25:26.270
oh what a response from Tonya couch yeah

1:25:24.590,1:25:29.280
the pressure hasn't affected there Todd

1:25:26.270,1:25:33.210
is still making her sharp

1:25:29.280,1:25:36.000
she won't be able to catch leader 92

1:25:33.210,1:25:38.330
points ahead that's gonna still give her

1:25:36.000,1:25:42.450
a chance

1:25:38.330,1:25:46.500
mrs. Tanya and even Georgia will have a

1:25:42.450,1:25:48.720
chance on that final round Great Falls

1:25:46.500,1:25:51.180
dive couch looking to stay within

1:25:48.720,1:25:53.280
touching distance and she does 72 marks

1:25:51.180,1:25:56.310
takes it to two eight five five oh that

1:25:53.280,1:25:58.890
means she's just over 20 points behind

1:25:56.310,1:26:01.140
Lully apricot shook with one round of

1:25:58.890,1:26:02.910
diving in this ten meter final to go so

1:26:01.140,1:26:05.340
put a cop took the defending champion

1:26:02.910,1:26:07.920
leads and she's got a handy cushion

1:26:05.340,1:26:11.880
ahead of capture more the two Brits in

1:26:07.920,1:26:16.140
second and third one round then left to

1:26:11.880,1:26:19.610
come on one round of real drama I'm sure

1:26:16.140,1:26:19.610
in store for us here in London

1:26:24.540,1:26:29.500
well we teed this competition up at the

1:26:27.070,1:26:33.580
start of the evening as potential drama

1:26:29.500,1:26:35.590
and it's exactly what we've got last

1:26:33.580,1:26:38.200
round to dive set in the women's ten

1:26:35.590,1:26:41.170
meter final at this 2016 European

1:26:38.200,1:26:44.080
Championship so like Kalonji 18 year old

1:26:41.170,1:26:45.670
from Paris has given a really good

1:26:44.080,1:26:47.380
account of herself this to sign off

1:26:45.670,1:26:51.910
there no medal tonight for a light but

1:26:47.380,1:26:54.070
it's a really good performance and she's

1:26:51.910,1:26:57.730
been solid tonight she really has she

1:26:54.070,1:27:01.870
has a unique sound to her entries it's

1:26:57.730,1:27:06.220
not even quite a tearing sound it's just

1:27:01.870,1:27:10.660
strange isn't it but it's medicine

1:27:06.220,1:27:12.940
rising so clearly she's not experienced

1:27:10.660,1:27:15.520
as the other drivers but she looks quite

1:27:12.940,1:27:17.670
poetic with her dives anyway and then

1:27:15.520,1:27:19.570
you get this really strange silence

1:27:17.670,1:27:22.230
sound on the entry

1:27:19.570,1:27:28.780
[Music]

1:27:22.230,1:27:30.970
moves to two seven nine 304 Kalonji

1:27:28.780,1:27:37.990
and that's really good work from the 18

1:27:30.970,1:27:39.970
year old great experience compadre at

1:27:37.990,1:27:42.040
Laura Marano has already experienced a

1:27:39.970,1:27:47.260
silver medal at these championships back

1:27:42.040,1:27:50.110
in 2015 but for her today it just hasn't

1:27:47.260,1:27:52.480
quite happened so back and forth at the

1:27:50.110,1:27:54.190
moment meaning this back to and half

1:27:52.480,1:27:57.390
somersaults with one and a half twists

1:27:54.190,1:28:00.100
has to be the best that she can make it

1:27:57.390,1:28:01.930
and if she can get up into the high 70s

1:28:00.100,1:28:09.010
80s maybe there's a chance

1:28:01.930,1:28:10.960
oh no just very short yeah when she was

1:28:09.010,1:28:13.540
on the platform the arms didn't swing up

1:28:10.960,1:28:16.600
over her head she looked very rigid here

1:28:13.540,1:28:19.930
and then going forward into the pipe

1:28:16.600,1:28:22.720
after the twist it just too low to the

1:28:19.930,1:28:24.670
water yeah very slow on the somersault

1:28:22.720,1:28:27.100
she tried to stay into the plaque as

1:28:24.670,1:28:28.780
long as she could but couldn't get

1:28:27.100,1:28:31.030
around to the vertical position she was

1:28:28.780,1:28:33.990
nine points behind Georgia who was in

1:28:31.030,1:28:37.510
third place at the end of Round four

1:28:33.990,1:28:40.150
after her full five rounds of diving

1:28:37.510,1:28:42.760
she's only eight points ahead of bukata

1:28:40.150,1:28:44.980
who's had four rounds so that puts it

1:28:42.760,1:28:48.090
into context it's unlikely to be a medal

1:28:44.980,1:28:50.720
for Moreno this evening

1:28:48.090,1:28:53.640
Genevieve green angelahr then of

1:28:50.720,1:28:55.650
Lithuania the 17-year old still smiling

1:28:53.640,1:28:58.590
the crowd of responded really well to

1:28:55.650,1:29:00.090
she's had a torrid time tonight started

1:28:58.590,1:29:02.310
off in the first round poorly that's

1:29:00.090,1:29:06.840
knocked her confidence and just wants an

1:29:02.310,1:29:07.650
entry in this final dive and she's got

1:29:06.840,1:29:10.290
it at last

1:29:07.650,1:29:12.300
well down to Genevieve and genomic yeah

1:29:10.290,1:29:15.480
the high score she's had at this point

1:29:12.300,1:29:19.590
was 43 she's got a 33 and 19 and then

1:29:15.480,1:29:21.750
the 8 but finally this is a dive there's

1:29:19.590,1:29:22.260
worthy of the European Championship good

1:29:21.750,1:29:26.880
jump

1:29:22.260,1:29:28.860
lovely Pike there locks out it's a shame

1:29:26.880,1:29:31.230
it's a low degree of difficulty and

1:29:28.860,1:29:32.790
they'll go more than 43 points but they

1:29:31.230,1:29:35.070
can't take away from her is the fact

1:29:32.790,1:29:37.650
that she's finished 12th in a European

1:29:35.070,1:29:42.050
Championship and that's something

1:29:37.650,1:29:46.080
certainly to brag about so and genomic

1:29:42.050,1:29:49.670
signs off with a good one same vine

1:29:46.080,1:29:52.710
doing we'll want to be doing the same

1:29:49.670,1:29:55.440
best finish that she's had in this

1:29:52.710,1:29:59.040
competition was last year and that was a

1:29:55.440,1:30:03.450
9th place so a good dive here and she

1:29:59.040,1:30:07.230
could improve on that qualified in

1:30:03.450,1:30:10.470
Knights came 9th last year and she's in

1:30:07.230,1:30:13.640
nights at the moment back two and a half

1:30:10.470,1:30:13.640
then for Celine

1:30:16.430,1:30:21.420
it's a nice finish but she keeps

1:30:18.990,1:30:23.490
throwing up that plume of splash when

1:30:21.420,1:30:24.960
she goes through the water yeah that's

1:30:23.490,1:30:27.570
cool it's not because of the take-off

1:30:24.960,1:30:29.430
this is good the pike is good but she

1:30:27.570,1:30:32.010
just doesn't reach back enough with

1:30:29.430,1:30:33.870
their hands it's almost like a shoulders

1:30:32.010,1:30:36.390
are too tired its left and to get the

1:30:33.870,1:30:38.760
arms back there needs to be reaching

1:30:36.390,1:30:41.280
back there doesn't do that the arms are

1:30:38.760,1:30:47.070
in front of the ears and the body just

1:30:41.280,1:30:48.510
collapses a little bit 56 5 5 then for

1:30:47.070,1:30:50.280
van doing that and the clunk you heard

1:30:48.510,1:30:52.260
on the microphone then that is fico

1:30:50.280,1:30:54.060
commentator kris know basically

1:30:52.260,1:30:56.010
demonstrating everything he talks about

1:30:54.060,1:31:00.240
it's an animated commentary box I can

1:30:56.010,1:31:01.890
tell you I'm like the Italians are they

1:31:00.240,1:31:03.570
had a good week the Italians and there

1:31:01.890,1:31:06.060
might still get better as well with del

1:31:03.570,1:31:08.730
a pain can yato to go in the 3 metre

1:31:06.060,1:31:11.400
synchro later this week now back to this

1:31:08.730,1:31:13.950
competition that's nicely to sign off

1:31:11.400,1:31:16.370
for Ukraine she's had a side night this

1:31:13.950,1:31:16.370
evening

1:31:25.589,1:31:31.229
no bad takeoff did find that entry where

1:31:30.059,1:31:33.539
did that come from

1:31:31.229,1:31:35.249
who's like there's oil on me into the

1:31:33.539,1:31:37.050
diving board that she just slipped off

1:31:35.249,1:31:40.409
she didn't get any jump just slides

1:31:37.050,1:31:43.219
there kicks good though and the entry

1:31:40.409,1:31:43.219
spines will help

1:31:43.710,1:31:49.050
well she can get now and start better

1:31:46.920,1:31:52.230
the judges won't be marking her down

1:31:49.050,1:31:55.160
there'll be a 70 pointer the entry they

1:31:52.230,1:31:59.280
will get still some good scores

1:31:55.160,1:32:02.220
64 for zero for Hannah Cross nicely to

1:31:59.280,1:32:04.860
finish off and acknowledges the applause

1:32:02.220,1:32:06.810
from the crowd some of that applause

1:32:04.860,1:32:08.400
very definitely directed towards this

1:32:06.810,1:32:11.430
young one a Georgia Ward then another

1:32:08.400,1:32:14.040
big moment for her already had one big

1:32:11.430,1:32:16.860
moment in the team competition diving

1:32:14.040,1:32:18.900
for that bronze medal and this is a

1:32:16.860,1:32:20.550
chance of another medal right here in

1:32:18.900,1:32:24.120
word three and a half somersaults in the

1:32:20.550,1:32:33.570
tuck position at 3.2 to post a score for

1:32:24.120,1:32:37.440
a medal no it's a Miss I'm afraid for

1:32:33.570,1:32:44.130
Award I tell you what though she might

1:32:37.440,1:32:47.210
still go ahead of Moreno a good tuck

1:32:44.130,1:32:53.340
just a little slow hesitating coming out

1:32:47.210,1:32:56.219
to kick over everything's good at this

1:32:53.340,1:33:02.280
point but out too late

1:32:56.219,1:33:04.860
and hits and three 2505 she does get

1:33:02.280,1:33:10.080
past laura marano of france to lead for

1:33:04.860,1:33:17.190
the moment twenty five is still a good

1:33:10.080,1:33:19.170
snore bad key with her final dive she

1:33:17.190,1:33:21.780
has not performed well this evening but

1:33:19.170,1:33:22.440
unbelievably just standing fifth

1:33:21.780,1:33:25.770
position

1:33:22.440,1:33:27.690
is there something for her still to be

1:33:25.770,1:33:29.280
had from this competition three point to

1:33:27.690,1:33:34.100
the degree of difficulty for this back

1:33:29.280,1:33:34.100
twister if she hits it she can score big

1:33:37.940,1:33:43.800
and that's not going to do it

1:33:40.320,1:33:46.020
she made it 74 points to go ahead of

1:33:43.800,1:33:48.860
Georgia Ward's haven't any chance of a

1:33:46.020,1:33:52.610
medal doesn't get the jump leans back

1:33:48.860,1:33:52.610
I'm very sure

1:33:53.760,1:34:01.889
Peter Park wobbling around that's a poor

1:33:58.260,1:34:04.590
last eye for her just you've got to get

1:34:01.889,1:34:06.090
that jump up off the tower she just

1:34:04.590,1:34:09.570
hasn't had that she she hasn't had that

1:34:06.090,1:34:11.249
snap this evening 308 four zero so third

1:34:09.570,1:34:15.920
position at the moment George award of

1:34:11.249,1:34:18.479
Great Britain still leads on 325 oh five

1:34:15.920,1:34:21.690
with three or four challenges still in

1:34:18.479,1:34:23.610
the mixed and consolation peck on the

1:34:21.690,1:34:29.989
cheek there from mum for now Amy back

1:34:23.610,1:34:29.989
key Katarina Patrick over sixth position

1:34:31.820,1:34:38.880
she at least record a score to ask some

1:34:35.429,1:34:42.150
questions here she would have to go

1:34:38.880,1:34:47.670
nines to go ahead of George award to get

1:34:42.150,1:34:50.699
81 points oh wow is that back twister

1:34:47.670,1:34:54.510
worth nines Chris on finals night it's

1:34:50.699,1:35:00.300
not worth nines maybe an eighth the

1:34:54.510,1:35:03.360
jumps good very fast twists too much to

1:35:00.300,1:35:07.170
go any higher than the night technically

1:35:03.360,1:35:13.789
good yeah she doesn't get the final lock

1:35:07.170,1:35:16.650
out maybe 70s well judges agree with you

1:35:13.789,1:35:20.519
just the one eight in there seven and a

1:35:16.650,1:35:23.670
half's for 72 three 16:05 so perchick

1:35:20.519,1:35:27.889
over finishes up behind george award and

1:35:23.670,1:35:27.889
ward moving ever closer to a medal

1:35:28.130,1:35:37.380
hurry up that one miss in the last round

1:35:32.690,1:35:39.150
let's basically cost her everything back

1:35:37.380,1:35:40.650
twister then two-and-a-half somersaults

1:35:39.150,1:35:43.080
with one and a half twists in the pike

1:35:40.650,1:35:46.260
position at 3.2 but she too would have

1:35:43.080,1:35:49.650
to go near to the maximum she would need

1:35:46.260,1:35:52.500
nines and maybe one nine and a half to

1:35:49.650,1:35:56.820
get to 325 which is what George Awards

1:35:52.500,1:35:58.650
on now it doesn't get a jump finishes

1:35:56.820,1:36:02.400
blow the board on that first one half

1:35:58.650,1:36:05.430
twist doesn't finish extending the legs

1:36:02.400,1:36:09.360
on the jump opening the pike and ducks

1:36:05.430,1:36:13.380
ahead down on the entry award has seen

1:36:09.360,1:36:15.590
another challenger for a medal off Corzo

1:36:13.380,1:36:20.190
was one of the danger women in this draw

1:36:15.590,1:36:24.960
he's below 300 and that's below par way

1:36:20.190,1:36:26.120
below par for her so Maria Cujo signs

1:36:24.960,1:36:28.950
off

1:36:26.120,1:36:33.990
three more to come

1:36:28.950,1:36:35.700
and well lassen has got a find a

1:36:33.990,1:36:37.290
phenomenal score and mathematically it

1:36:35.700,1:36:39.810
may not even be possible well nines

1:36:37.290,1:36:41.880
Chris snowed is saying nines for us and

1:36:39.810,1:36:48.150
if she wants to get close to George

1:36:41.880,1:36:50.340
Awards score for a bronze medal it's a

1:36:48.150,1:36:53.250
good dive it's a really good effort but

1:36:50.340,1:36:55.770
again it's not gonna be enough now that

1:36:53.250,1:36:58.410
little movement on the end will keep it

1:36:55.770,1:37:03.270
down to seven laughs maybe a knight

1:36:58.410,1:37:05.970
again just too much moving over she

1:37:03.270,1:37:10.710
watching on the replay just legs a

1:37:05.970,1:37:12.240
little bit I think she's gone well you

1:37:10.710,1:37:15.300
can hear those scores in the background

1:37:12.240,1:37:17.730
you can multiply that against the 3.2

1:37:15.300,1:37:21.060
and what it means is that George award

1:37:17.730,1:37:24.060
is going to take a medal away from this

1:37:21.060,1:37:26.880
European Championship final the color

1:37:24.060,1:37:32.210
will be decided by the next two divers

1:37:26.880,1:37:35.030
so us and signs off with 310 scored and

1:37:32.210,1:37:38.310
rakaat Chuck takes a big deep breath

1:37:35.030,1:37:41.100
from her point of view this back twister

1:37:38.310,1:37:44.850
is all about shutting the door on the

1:37:41.100,1:37:51.540
rest so to move into top spot she

1:37:44.850,1:37:53.760
doesn't have to do too much she just has

1:37:51.540,1:37:55.770
to perform a fifth dive quite

1:37:53.760,1:37:58.950
beautifully and that's probably gold I

1:37:55.770,1:38:01.429
tell you what I reckon she's gonna break

1:37:58.950,1:38:07.490
the European record as three

1:38:01.429,1:38:09.860
73.3 that she set in 2013

1:38:07.490,1:38:11.360
that is a really good call Chris and she

1:38:09.860,1:38:13.670
thoroughly deserves it that's five

1:38:11.360,1:38:16.310
rounds of cracking diving from pro kata

1:38:13.670,1:38:19.990
she's gonna smash the record certainly

1:38:16.310,1:38:22.760
she's gonna get more than 68 points

1:38:19.990,1:38:25.520
apricot jerk looks like she's defending

1:38:22.760,1:38:30.290
her title to make it five goals and a

1:38:25.520,1:38:33.890
new European record at 385 nine Oh pro

1:38:30.290,1:38:36.560
Katja reigning supreme here in this Paul

1:38:33.890,1:38:37.640
now that would have got her a bronze

1:38:36.560,1:38:39.170
medal at the Olympic Games

1:38:37.640,1:38:42.170
Wow well that's what everybody's looking

1:38:39.170,1:38:45.320
for against the rest of the world in Rio

1:38:42.170,1:38:50.590
and pro culture will go there in great

1:38:45.320,1:38:53.780
form couch then still diving for a medal

1:38:50.590,1:38:56.240
and that'll do it

1:38:53.780,1:38:58.760
brilliant dive from Tonya couch and the

1:38:56.240,1:39:01.490
celebration under the water tells you

1:38:58.760,1:39:05.300
all you need to know she's done it she's

1:39:01.490,1:39:06.160
got her medal at last and what a way to

1:39:05.300,1:39:09.980
do it

1:39:06.160,1:39:13.550
she's got tens on this dive before not

1:39:09.980,1:39:15.349
quite a turn because it's a loss flashy

1:39:13.550,1:39:18.699
look how high she finishes she just

1:39:15.349,1:39:21.110
continues to float down from 7 meters

1:39:18.699,1:39:23.780
this is her favorite diet that's why

1:39:21.110,1:39:26.840
she's got it here in round number 5 it's

1:39:23.780,1:39:28.639
a reliable one was promised you we

1:39:26.840,1:39:30.880
promised you were good and to start the

1:39:28.639,1:39:33.739
evening we've got a new European record

1:39:30.880,1:39:37.130
we've got two medals for Great Britain

1:39:33.739,1:39:39.139
Tonya couch at the expense of her

1:39:37.130,1:39:40.579
compatriot George award claims the

1:39:39.139,1:39:43.219
silver but George award will be

1:39:40.579,1:39:46.159
delighted with her second medal at this

1:39:43.219,1:39:49.520
Europeans but hats off to Lully apricot

1:39:49.520,1:39:53.719
right up there with the rest of the

1:39:51.530,1:39:57.500
world and it's the defence of her title

1:39:53.719,1:39:59.300
