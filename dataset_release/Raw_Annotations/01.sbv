0:00:00.089,0:00:04.170
the final event of the diving pool is

0:00:01.920,0:00:06.690
the men's 10 metre platform competition

0:00:04.170,0:00:09.510
one of the blue-ribbon events of the

0:00:06.690,0:00:12.960
whole games a spectacular combination of

0:00:09.510,0:00:15.599
artistry athleticism and sheer courage

0:00:12.960,0:00:18.539
it's a long journey to the medals podium

0:00:15.599,0:00:21.449
though 32 divers are in the pool for

0:00:18.539,0:00:22.920
tonight's preliminary round only 18 will

0:00:21.449,0:00:25.800
survive to make it into tomorrow

0:00:22.920,0:00:27.869
morning's semi-final the top 12 from

0:00:25.800,0:00:30.689
there we'll go forward to tomorrow night

0:00:27.869,0:00:32.219
to compete for gold expect the

0:00:30.689,0:00:34.290
atmosphere to hit fever pitch tonight

0:00:32.219,0:00:36.899
because Great Britain's poster boy Tom

0:00:34.290,0:00:38.969
Daley begins his personal quest for

0:00:36.899,0:00:41.520
glory having missed out on a medal in

0:00:38.969,0:00:43.559
the 10 metre synchro competition and he

0:00:41.520,0:00:45.989
and Peter Waterfield finished just out

0:00:43.559,0:00:47.640
of the frame in fourth place the Brits

0:00:45.989,0:00:49.920
are in action tonight and they brought

0:00:47.640,0:00:52.230
their support as ever but the world's

0:00:49.920,0:00:54.059
best are all in the lineup here two

0:00:52.230,0:00:56.879
Olympic champions two world champions

0:00:54.059,0:00:59.010
the Chinese have dominated in a diving

0:00:56.879,0:01:02.280
pool again but Russia's Ilya Zakharov

0:00:59.010,0:01:03.390
who won at gold at 3 meters as we look

0:01:02.280,0:01:05.010
at Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield

0:01:03.390,0:01:05.519
they're they're the ones getting the

0:01:05.010,0:01:07.890
cheers

0:01:05.519,0:01:10.860
well that Russian has proved the Chinese

0:01:07.890,0:01:12.720
are not completely unbeatable indeed 10

0:01:10.860,0:01:15.509
meters it's supposed to be the Chinese

0:01:12.720,0:01:17.280
team's most vulnerable event mind you

0:01:15.509,0:01:20.430
there's only one gold in three of the

0:01:17.280,0:01:21.659
last five Olympic Games we'll explain

0:01:20.430,0:01:24.090
the scoring and some of the more

0:01:21.659,0:01:26.790
technical aspects as we go along but the

0:01:24.090,0:01:29.250
important thing here is just to enjoy a

0:01:26.790,0:01:31.020
great show Steve for Billy Otis

0:01:29.250,0:01:32.610
alongside me looking to do just that as

0:01:31.020,0:01:34.860
well Steve you smell a lot of these

0:01:32.610,0:01:37.409
games covering the gymnastics and many

0:01:34.860,0:01:39.270
many ways is this what these guys are

0:01:37.409,0:01:40.439
they're gymnasts well they are really

0:01:39.270,0:01:44.130
and that you're going to see a lot of

0:01:40.439,0:01:46.020
the skills from gymnastics transfer

0:01:44.130,0:01:48.090
across to the 10-meter platform they've

0:01:46.020,0:01:50.640
only got three seconds though to get it

0:01:48.090,0:01:53.880
down from platform to water or even a

0:01:50.640,0:01:55.950
little less than that and six dives each

0:01:53.880,0:01:57.509
in what is quite a lengthy session for

0:01:55.950,0:01:59.100
them and as you mentioned Roger it's a

0:01:57.509,0:02:01.320
little bit of a marathon effort to get

0:01:59.100,0:02:03.689
yourself from these preliminaries into

0:02:01.320,0:02:06.149
the final and so they don't want to

0:02:03.689,0:02:07.439
start poorly it's in that respect it's

0:02:06.149,0:02:10.500
also like the gymnastics you have a

0:02:07.439,0:02:12.090
major qualifying day which

0:02:10.500,0:02:14.700
allows you to progress to a number of

0:02:12.090,0:02:16.200
other events in this case it's the you

0:02:14.700,0:02:18.990
know platform on through to the

0:02:16.200,0:02:20.190
semi-final to the final and we wish them

0:02:18.990,0:02:21.960
all well and we wish them safe

0:02:20.190,0:02:23.580
competition because that is a long way

0:02:21.960,0:02:25.080
up and some of the competitors will tell

0:02:23.580,0:02:26.760
you themselves they don't know why they

0:02:25.080,0:02:29.160
do it and they very aware of the danger

0:02:26.760,0:02:31.890
but it also makes for spectacular sport

0:02:29.160,0:02:35.130
they hit the water at speeds in excess

0:02:31.890,0:02:36.810
of 30 miles per hour so get it wrong and

0:02:35.130,0:02:38.460
getting it wrong is the big pressure of

0:02:36.810,0:02:39.960
course Steve because again like the

0:02:38.460,0:02:43.230
gymnasts and wahla to these artistic

0:02:39.960,0:02:45.420
sports that you cannot afford to get a

0:02:43.230,0:02:48.960
dive wrong because it could be game over

0:02:45.420,0:02:50.190
and with your first dive there's always

0:02:48.960,0:02:52.050
that pressure and no matter how

0:02:50.190,0:02:54.510
experienced you might be and live

0:02:52.050,0:02:56.400
galperin will go up first at 27 year old

0:02:54.510,0:02:58.260
russian and he's seen it all done it all

0:02:56.400,0:03:00.840
been out for a spell with injuries like

0:02:58.260,0:03:02.760
many of them have but to be the very

0:03:00.840,0:03:06.060
first competitor up brings its own

0:03:02.760,0:03:08.520
pressure but it won't be unfamiliar to

0:03:06.060,0:03:09.870
most of these leads who come to this

0:03:08.520,0:03:12.870
level of competition only because

0:03:09.870,0:03:15.060
they're very very good 6 dives each

0:03:12.870,0:03:17.790
tonight each dive has an agreed degree

0:03:15.060,0:03:19.800
of difficulty 7 judges who mark each

0:03:17.790,0:03:21.420
dive out of 10 the highest and lowest

0:03:19.800,0:03:23.700
two marks are discounted then the

0:03:21.420,0:03:26.100
remaining total is multiplied by the

0:03:23.700,0:03:28.200
degree of difficulty or the tariff that

0:03:26.100,0:03:30.270
is given to each dive sounds complicated

0:03:28.200,0:03:31.800
the captions you'll see come out the

0:03:30.270,0:03:34.739
graphics they will make it very clear

0:03:31.800,0:03:36.989
which marks are counting so don't worry

0:03:34.739,0:03:38.820
too much about any technicalities just

0:03:36.989,0:03:42.600
enjoy the show as we've said because the

0:03:38.820,0:03:46.110
action here can be spectacular 11 of

0:03:42.600,0:03:47.850
these divers plus one more have already

0:03:46.110,0:03:49.260
been in action in the synchronized

0:03:47.850,0:03:51.209
swimming which at least gives them a

0:03:49.260,0:03:53.220
feel of the pool but for most of them

0:03:51.209,0:03:56.040
it's been a long long wait to get there

0:03:53.220,0:03:58.440
Olympic Games underway quite a warm

0:03:56.040,0:04:00.209
evening and we're sitting up towards the

0:03:58.440,0:04:04.320
top of the venue where the warm air is

0:04:00.209,0:04:05.459
settling and we certainly feeling it but

0:04:04.320,0:04:07.080
I wouldn't mind a dip in their pool

0:04:05.459,0:04:08.220
myself but I don't think they're gonna

0:04:07.080,0:04:10.560
let us down there Roger

0:04:08.220,0:04:12.330
unfortunately not you'll see this just a

0:04:10.560,0:04:14.820
little bit of a glaze across the top of

0:04:12.330,0:04:16.230
the pool they put a spray on top of it

0:04:14.820,0:04:18.540
because when the divers are coming down

0:04:16.230,0:04:21.090
it gets rid of that mirror effect and

0:04:18.540,0:04:22.350
they can actually judge the distance

0:04:21.090,0:04:23.880
they are from the water I mean it's

0:04:22.350,0:04:25.260
frightening to think all that it's going

0:04:23.880,0:04:27.240
through their mind they tend to pick a

0:04:25.260,0:04:29.820
spot on the the ceiling on the outside

0:04:27.240,0:04:32.190
to use as a rotation point to orientate

0:04:29.820,0:04:33.870
themselves around for those of us who

0:04:32.190,0:04:37.140
don't do this sport we don't know how

0:04:33.870,0:04:39.570
they do it really no thanks no a lot of

0:04:37.140,0:04:42.030
courage serious amount of training and

0:04:39.570,0:04:43.830
work in the gym and a bit of work

0:04:42.030,0:04:45.780
between the ears as well to convince

0:04:43.830,0:04:47.940
yourself through how it should be done

0:04:45.780,0:04:50.490
and that should it be done at all that

0:04:47.940,0:04:52.500
we've galperin first of all one of the

0:04:50.490,0:04:53.970
most experienced competitors in the

0:04:52.500,0:04:59.070
competition the dives will get more

0:04:53.970,0:05:00.660
difficult as they go along in good three

0:04:59.070,0:05:03.030
and a half somersault over the three

0:05:00.660,0:05:04.320
point two tariffs and always so pleased

0:05:03.030,0:05:08.100
to get that first one out of the way and

0:05:04.320,0:05:10.410
it looked like he did a very good job in

0:05:08.100,0:05:12.180
tight to the platform that's part of the

0:05:10.410,0:05:18.900
danger of course and hit the water nice

0:05:12.180,0:05:22.380
and vertically and the good scores

0:05:18.900,0:05:24.780
coming in for him than 88 to start with

0:05:22.380,0:05:29.270
and four scores rejected as Rogers

0:05:24.780,0:05:29.270
explained to you the top two and bottom

0:05:29.450,0:05:34.830
299 a half's are excellent stuff this is

0:05:32.370,0:05:38.400
Lin UA who's one of the two Chinese

0:05:34.830,0:05:40.950
divers he was the 2008 Olympic synchro

0:05:38.400,0:05:42.780
champion competing this time

0:05:40.950,0:05:46.460
individually in with three and a half

0:05:42.780,0:05:46.460
somersault tucked position

0:05:49.650,0:05:53.620
just managed to fold it in underneath

0:05:51.970,0:05:55.389
the water make that little somersault

0:05:53.620,0:06:01.509
beneath so try and get those shins

0:05:55.389,0:06:03.460
vertical a nice tight tuck position and

0:06:01.509,0:06:08.289
gets through those somersaults early so

0:06:03.460,0:06:13.210
we can spot the water plenty of nines

0:06:08.289,0:06:15.699
coming the way of linear and they try

0:06:13.210,0:06:17.500
and drag those bubbles down with them to

0:06:15.699,0:06:20.710
create the best possible entry and least

0:06:17.500,0:06:22.659
possible splash you'll see them on the

0:06:20.710,0:06:24.789
way down the the replays which I should

0:06:22.659,0:06:28.539
emphasize the judges don't see those

0:06:24.789,0:06:30.449
replays we do you do but the judges have

0:06:28.539,0:06:33.970
to get their judgment right in one go

0:06:30.449,0:06:36.580
Victor Ortega from Colombia his second

0:06:33.970,0:06:38.080
Olympic Games and he kicks off for the

0:06:36.580,0:06:41.099
back two and a half somersault one and a

0:06:38.080,0:06:41.099
half twist piked

0:06:44.510,0:06:49.040
we just rolled that one over with his

0:06:46.610,0:06:55.040
feet and that's a little error that the

0:06:49.040,0:06:57.110
judges never miss certainly seem to get

0:06:55.040,0:06:59.660
through the twisting okay spots the

0:06:57.110,0:07:04.370
water now and those feet just roll over

0:06:59.660,0:07:05.750
so no chance of nines there judges are

0:07:04.370,0:07:07.430
looking for that tightness in either the

0:07:05.750,0:07:09.860
tucked all the Pike's position just how

0:07:07.430,0:07:13.700
close you can get your torso to the

0:07:09.860,0:07:15.980
thighs and really bunched up there so

0:07:13.700,0:07:18.230
he's giving up a few points to the early

0:07:15.980,0:07:20.540
divers already but the chances to make

0:07:18.230,0:07:28.670
them up of course with this long first

0:07:20.540,0:07:30.140
session anton zakharov from ukraine next

0:07:28.670,0:07:32.600
to go not to be confused with Ilya

0:07:30.140,0:07:36.830
Zakharov from Russia who won the synchro

0:07:32.600,0:07:39.760
competition in with three and a half

0:07:36.830,0:07:39.760
somersault tucked

0:07:41.270,0:07:48.569
popular starting dive and it gives you a

0:07:43.439,0:07:52.769
chance at home to compare how well it's

0:07:48.569,0:07:55.199
performed closeness to the board is just

0:07:52.769,0:07:57.539
unnerving at times isn't it yeah you

0:07:55.199,0:08:01.259
know and I don't think he he was still a

0:07:57.539,0:08:04.009
little bent at the hips as he entered

0:08:01.259,0:08:06.289
the water so wasn't quite vertical

0:08:04.009,0:08:08.719
hadn't quite come out of it a little

0:08:06.289,0:08:10.580
concern there I think for how tidy was

0:08:08.719,0:08:18.749
to the platform

0:08:10.580,0:08:23.069
72 for Sakharov Timofey older chick from

0:08:18.749,0:08:25.699
Belarus 10th in the World Championships

0:08:23.069,0:08:28.469
in Shanghai in 2011 is his best

0:08:25.699,0:08:33.769
performance to date back to an a half

0:08:28.469,0:08:33.769
somersault won the half-twist point

0:08:39.729,0:08:47.300
maybe just slightly under rotating as he

0:08:42.619,0:08:49.939
hit the water as opposed to Ortega who

0:08:47.300,0:08:52.809
overcooked it a little bit of a loss of

0:08:49.939,0:08:56.119
leg form there as the ankles came apart

0:08:52.809,0:08:57.860
so it sounds to like the judges have

0:08:56.119,0:08:59.739
spotted what we have if the ankles just

0:08:57.860,0:09:08.439
couldn't quite lock themselves together

0:08:59.739,0:09:08.439
and actually came apart twice so 72

0:09:10.139,0:09:16.149
he owned Jewry from the Democratic

0:09:13.119,0:09:18.999
People's Republic of Korea just 16 years

0:09:16.149,0:09:22.230
of age there's a lot of teenagers in

0:09:18.999,0:09:22.230
this competition as well

0:09:27.089,0:09:31.290
for with three and a half somersaults

0:09:32.459,0:09:37.059
galperin sir 88 is still standing at the

0:09:35.199,0:09:40.889
moment but we're expecting the Chinese

0:09:37.059,0:09:46.899
competitors here to do a wonderful job

0:09:40.889,0:09:49.299
it's so graceful and you see that he's

0:09:46.899,0:09:57.279
absolutely ripped that entry is barely a

0:09:49.299,0:10:04.359
splash drags all the bubbles down with

0:09:57.279,0:10:08.739
him two eight seven eight and a half

0:10:04.359,0:10:14.100
there this is Jimmy Connor from

0:10:08.739,0:10:22.179
Australia 17 years of age from Melbourne

0:10:14.100,0:10:23.769
lives in Brisbane trains there he's just

0:10:22.179,0:10:26.410
rolled the feet over there he won't be

0:10:23.769,0:10:27.850
too pleased with that first effort he

0:10:26.410,0:10:29.319
was the youngest in the Australian team

0:10:27.850,0:10:32.860
at the Delhi Commonwealth Games with

0:10:29.319,0:10:37.119
just 15 come to the top quickly and

0:10:32.860,0:10:43.029
early perhaps his best opening dive and

0:10:37.119,0:10:43.389
as the sevens come in he's entitle to be

0:10:43.029,0:10:45.129
nervous

0:10:43.389,0:10:49.029
frightening Lee young some of these

0:10:45.129,0:10:51.129
competitors quite an age range right up

0:10:49.029,0:10:53.470
into the the early 30s and I Peter

0:10:51.129,0:10:54.819
Waterfield from Great Britain and the

0:10:53.470,0:10:57.579
more senior divers in the whole

0:10:54.819,0:11:02.049
competition down to 15 and 16 year old

0:10:57.579,0:11:06.009
young boys really Martin Wolfram he's

0:11:02.049,0:11:07.899
aged 20 from Germany arm stand back

0:11:06.009,0:11:10.749
double somersault two and a half twists

0:11:07.899,0:11:13.629
an ambitious opening dive he's armed

0:11:10.749,0:11:16.149
stand positions are really hearty in

0:11:13.629,0:11:19.629
mouth for all of us watching high

0:11:16.149,0:11:22.319
tariffs to start off with the 3.6 see if

0:11:19.629,0:11:22.319
he can cash in

0:11:23.869,0:11:29.220
now okay and consider the degree of

0:11:27.689,0:11:36.749
difficulty is going to help him but the

0:11:29.220,0:11:38.670
execution not perfect the lower tariff

0:11:36.749,0:11:40.439
dives have got to be executed absolutely

0:11:38.670,0:11:40.829
spot-on you a little bit more margin for

0:11:40.439,0:11:43.049
error

0:11:40.829,0:11:44.309
on the higher more difficult dives but

0:11:43.049,0:11:46.079
obviously they want to cash in don't

0:11:44.309,0:11:47.819
think yeah and a different sort of error

0:11:46.079,0:11:50.459
they wasn't quite square to the water

0:11:47.819,0:11:52.589
his feet were twisted an ankle certainly

0:11:50.459,0:11:54.480
together and that again should be an

0:11:52.589,0:12:00.600
error that the judges can catch a first

0:11:54.480,0:12:06.769
look a first an only look in Claire

0:12:00.600,0:12:06.769
Aggie era from Cuba second Olympic Games

0:12:06.829,0:12:16.350
aged 22 another forward three and a half

0:12:13.860,0:12:20.220
somersault well he crashed into the

0:12:16.350,0:12:24.509
water really that was hardly miserable

0:12:20.220,0:12:26.279
in the era as on the entry knees a

0:12:24.509,0:12:28.470
little bent in the pike position there's

0:12:26.279,0:12:34.379
a few problems here for him he wasn't

0:12:28.470,0:12:35.910
square and it is the errors that the

0:12:34.379,0:12:37.589
judges are looking for we we certainly

0:12:35.910,0:12:39.779
don't mean to sound negative about these

0:12:37.589,0:12:40.920
great divers though at the Olympics

0:12:39.779,0:12:42.839
because they're the world's best but

0:12:40.920,0:12:44.819
when we're trying to reflect that the

0:12:42.839,0:12:47.549
thoughts of the judges here and the 61

0:12:44.819,0:12:50.699
five is a that's the lowest so far so he

0:12:47.549,0:12:53.639
had a few problems next up is Alexander

0:12:50.699,0:12:56.509
Bondar from the Ukraine he was already

0:12:53.639,0:12:59.309
competed in the synchro competition with

0:12:56.509,0:13:01.019
Alexander course covers off finished

0:12:59.309,0:13:05.089
eighth in with three and a half

0:13:01.019,0:13:05.089
somersault to begin his routine

0:13:11.129,0:13:17.259
well very tidy should do well here bond

0:13:14.800,0:13:24.429
are not too many identifiable problems

0:13:17.259,0:13:26.139
to his opening dive some of the Eastern

0:13:24.429,0:13:28.569
European divers are a little bit more

0:13:26.139,0:13:29.619
powerfully built which does tend to give

0:13:28.569,0:13:32.199
a different impression they're almost

0:13:29.619,0:13:34.199
more muscular divers than some of the

0:13:32.199,0:13:36.459
Chinese divers who were so incredibly

0:13:34.199,0:13:39.220
slight and whippy through the air I

0:13:36.459,0:13:41.199
think yes and there there's less mass

0:13:39.220,0:13:45.100
entering the water gives the Chinese

0:13:41.199,0:13:48.220
divers a better entry quite often but

0:13:45.100,0:13:49.740
the powerful men can certainly get the

0:13:48.220,0:13:54.179
job done in a different way

0:13:49.740,0:13:54.179
Jihu Park from Korea

0:13:57.900,0:14:07.470
thank you sir just rolling over a little

0:14:00.450,0:14:10.140
for park out of Busan in Korea had a

0:14:07.470,0:14:17.640
successful Asian Games its third in the

0:14:10.140,0:14:23.250
synchro 3-meter springboard and 72

0:14:17.640,0:14:25.140
equals seventh best mark they take a

0:14:23.250,0:14:27.480
long time for these positions to really

0:14:25.140,0:14:30.150
make a huge amount of sense with 32

0:14:27.480,0:14:32.190
divers to to get through really a

0:14:30.150,0:14:35.010
question of them getting this evening

0:14:32.190,0:14:37.080
out the way making no mistakes getting a

0:14:35.010,0:14:38.940
feel for the competition and maybe at

0:14:37.080,0:14:40.800
the top end laying down the odd marker

0:14:38.940,0:14:45.200
if you're amongst those with high

0:14:40.800,0:14:50.520
aspirations Victor mini bias from Russia

0:14:45.200,0:14:54.140
sixth in the 10 metre synchro as well in

0:14:50.520,0:14:54.140
with three and a half somersault tucked

0:15:04.050,0:15:09.670
well he was there a long time and I

0:15:08.140,0:15:11.260
wonder if there were a few stray

0:15:09.670,0:15:16.510
thoughts entering his mind

0:15:11.260,0:15:19.030
and if the execution was solid until he

0:15:16.510,0:15:22.390
kicked out for the entry and it was just

0:15:19.030,0:15:25.930
caught a bit short so that large splash

0:15:22.390,0:15:27.430
is such a giveaway a little bit of a

0:15:25.930,0:15:29.020
split in the tuck position most of the

0:15:27.430,0:15:31.150
divers have that it doesn't this upset

0:15:29.020,0:15:34.660
the judges too much they really only see

0:15:31.150,0:15:38.110
that from sidon but many buy of has paid

0:15:34.660,0:15:39.610
a penalty for the entry for sure I get

0:15:38.110,0:15:42.040
the right push off as well to get

0:15:39.610,0:15:43.870
through the rotations in time to unwind

0:15:42.040,0:15:47.830
to give themselves the chance of the

0:15:43.870,0:15:50.590
clean entry there's no spring on that

0:15:47.830,0:15:52.120
obviously it's all comes from the their

0:15:50.590,0:15:56.740
own push off and their own technique

0:15:52.120,0:15:58.870
German Sanchez from Mexico silver

0:15:56.740,0:16:03.420
medalist of the 10 metre synchro Mexico

0:15:58.870,0:16:05.710
who had a decent games the diving pool

0:16:03.420,0:16:11.350
such a strong nation in this sport

0:16:05.710,0:16:14.530
Mexico or nice the crowd really

0:16:11.350,0:16:17.620
appreciated that entry there their

0:16:14.530,0:16:19.450
instant experts like like everyone at

0:16:17.620,0:16:22.090
home but you learn to pick a good dive

0:16:19.450,0:16:25.240
don't you in the the entry is such an

0:16:22.090,0:16:26.830
important impression to leave they call

0:16:25.240,0:16:27.730
it the RIP don't then you can hear that

0:16:26.830,0:16:31.300
different sound

0:16:27.730,0:16:33.400
he's only 47 K that seven stone six was

0:16:31.300,0:16:35.200
on the lightest going and really the

0:16:33.400,0:16:37.330
spin speed there in his rotations and

0:16:35.200,0:16:40.120
he's earnt the top mark so far galperin

0:16:37.330,0:16:42.640
the first diver was leading for quite a

0:16:40.120,0:16:46.240
time there with 88 but now eighty nine

0:16:42.640,0:16:47.980
point one for German Sanchez and his

0:16:46.240,0:16:49.690
strong performance in the synchro would

0:16:47.980,0:16:51.160
serve up his confidence and confidence

0:16:49.690,0:16:54.100
as in all sports but this in particular

0:16:51.160,0:16:56.410
is massive and you can understand why

0:16:54.100,0:16:59.670
from that formidable height Rowley

0:16:56.410,0:16:59.670
McCormick from Canada

0:17:02.210,0:17:07.040
again a very nice entry of from Riley

0:17:08.270,0:17:13.830
his second Olympics he didn't make the

0:17:10.920,0:17:15.750
final in Beijing finished 16th so his

0:17:13.830,0:17:18.090
first aim will be to not just get

0:17:15.750,0:17:19.770
through tonight but tomorrow morning and

0:17:18.090,0:17:23.520
being the father would be good for him

0:17:19.770,0:17:29.910
he'll turn 21 in a couple of weeks and

0:17:23.520,0:17:31.380
has made a very solid start here 73.5

0:17:29.910,0:17:33.630
leaves him in equals seventh position

0:17:31.380,0:17:35.610
and there are lots of interest about our

0:17:33.630,0:17:39.420
next competitor yep one of the stars of

0:17:35.610,0:17:46.010
the show the superstar from Beijing

0:17:39.420,0:17:48.660
Matthew Mitchum he is a big man is me

0:17:46.010,0:17:51.030
well he's a big star in Australia that's

0:17:48.660,0:17:52.890
for sure his face has been all over the

0:17:51.030,0:17:56.370
pre-olympic publicity because he's a

0:17:52.890,0:17:59.760
defending champion but I think even

0:17:56.370,0:18:01.260
Matthew and would admit that the entry

0:17:59.760,0:18:06.180
here wasn't quite what he was looking

0:18:01.260,0:18:12.420
for ever so tiny over rotation of the

0:18:06.180,0:18:14.450
feet first Australian male to win

0:18:12.420,0:18:17.940
Olympic gold medal in diving since in

0:18:14.450,0:18:21.150
1924 when he got it - four years ago in

0:18:17.940,0:18:23.370
Beijing in the most spectacular fashion

0:18:21.150,0:18:29.280
with one of the great dives of all time

0:18:23.370,0:18:31.880
in the last round - snatch victory loves

0:18:29.280,0:18:37.340
competing you can see that with a smile

0:18:31.880,0:18:37.340
Almond his mervich of Norway

0:18:38.600,0:18:43.270
[Applause]

0:18:40.980,0:18:46.840
opening back two and a half somersault

0:18:43.270,0:18:49.170
with one and a half twists and he got

0:18:46.840,0:18:52.510
through everything here pretty tightly

0:18:49.170,0:18:54.940
feet just came together a little tardily

0:18:52.510,0:18:58.450
but he's gonna pick up some nice marks

0:18:54.940,0:19:00.340
here he's mervich with an eighty one

0:18:58.450,0:19:01.600
point six anything in the 80s is going

0:19:00.340,0:19:06.490
to leave you in good stead for your

0:19:01.600,0:19:08.500
second dive and onward german sanchez

0:19:06.490,0:19:12.010
huge first score of eighty nine point

0:19:08.500,0:19:18.100
one francesco de Lomo

0:19:12.010,0:19:25.540
from italy this is third olympic games

0:19:18.100,0:19:27.010
so an experienced competitor all the two

0:19:25.540,0:19:30.250
and a half somersault with one twist

0:19:27.010,0:19:32.710
piped very nice bring lots of experience

0:19:30.250,0:19:38.140
to be in ninth and the platform back in

0:19:32.710,0:19:40.560
Athens Oh for didn't make the final in

0:19:38.140,0:19:40.560
Beijing

0:19:45.850,0:19:51.580
not too much wrong in for Francesco just

0:19:48.190,0:19:56.370
a confidence-building start 72.5 will

0:19:51.580,0:20:00.460
need to build on that varying degrees of

0:19:56.370,0:20:03.880
pedigree in the countries diving history

0:20:00.460,0:20:06.100
really divers like Christopher s Gilson

0:20:03.880,0:20:08.680
from Sweden don't have a massive

0:20:06.100,0:20:10.540
tradition in this sport and facilities

0:20:08.680,0:20:12.700
sometimes more limited back two and a

0:20:10.540,0:20:20.200
half somersault one and a half twist for

0:20:12.700,0:20:21.520
his opening dive in keeps one of the

0:20:20.200,0:20:24.100
divers is really looking to get into

0:20:21.520,0:20:27.700
that semi-final first as a benchmark of

0:20:24.100,0:20:31.180
progress and achievement it's not a nice

0:20:27.700,0:20:33.640
job here try and get through the twists

0:20:31.180,0:20:36.370
as early as possible square yourself up

0:20:33.640,0:20:38.770
for the entry entry and not too much

0:20:36.370,0:20:41.800
wrong there from Christopher SQL some 23

0:20:38.770,0:20:43.360
years old trains in Malmo it just

0:20:41.800,0:20:46.060
bothered me a little it he wasn't quite

0:20:43.360,0:20:48.190
square but a seventy six point eight

0:20:46.060,0:20:49.170
that's all right he's top ten at the

0:20:48.190,0:20:51.070
moment

0:20:49.170,0:20:53.370
thirty-two in the field of course at

0:20:51.070,0:20:58.900
this stage

0:20:53.370,0:21:03.690
Eric sane from Canada his first Olympic

0:20:58.900,0:21:05.920
Games had success as a synchro diver but

0:21:03.690,0:21:09.330
he's on his own with a back two and a

0:21:05.920,0:21:09.330
half somersault two and a half twist

0:21:12.270,0:21:17.560
and again quite a high tariff dive to

0:21:14.860,0:21:20.200
open up your program with years and he

0:21:17.560,0:21:22.690
didn't quite get through it there was a

0:21:20.200,0:21:25.120
big splash because he wasn't vertical a

0:21:22.690,0:21:27.250
little bend at the hips on entry this

0:21:25.120,0:21:29.530
will show us so much more clearly in a

0:21:27.250,0:21:31.810
slow-mo all his knees were bent there

0:21:29.530,0:21:33.460
there were there were a number of

0:21:31.810,0:21:42.370
problems there and the judges have hit

0:21:33.460,0:21:43.870
him hard was messy I'm sorry I want to

0:21:42.370,0:21:45.790
be more complimentary maybe put the

0:21:43.870,0:21:50.310
tough one in early maybe to get it out

0:21:45.790,0:21:55.780
of the way but 59 4 is not too special

0:21:50.310,0:22:04.930
not in your first Olympic dive Brian

0:21:55.780,0:22:06.730
Nixon low-mass from Malaysia arm stand

0:22:04.930,0:22:12.250
back double somersault one and a half

0:22:06.730,0:22:19.350
twist to start his program his third

0:22:12.250,0:22:21.850
Olympic Games very nice

0:22:19.350,0:22:24.520
created a good entry even if he wasn't

0:22:21.850,0:22:27.100
completely vertical so he's ticked a

0:22:24.520,0:22:28.900
couple of boxes and maybe left one

0:22:27.100,0:22:30.760
uncheck but he's a former world junior

0:22:28.900,0:22:33.750
champion and he created history for

0:22:30.760,0:22:36.520
Malaysia when he achieved that in 2004

0:22:33.750,0:22:41.880
and he's got to get some good marks here

0:22:36.520,0:22:47.490
and with a reasonable tariff he'll be ok

0:22:41.880,0:22:54.580
with an 81 6 so that's good enough for a

0:22:47.490,0:22:58.330
equal fourth position at the moment next

0:22:54.580,0:23:02.200
up is Yvonne Garcia from Mexico on a

0:22:58.330,0:23:04.540
half of the silver medal winning duo in

0:23:02.200,0:23:08.610
the 10 meters synchro with German

0:23:04.540,0:23:08.610
Sanchez just 18

0:23:10.959,0:23:15.879
opening up with a forward

0:23:12.589,0:23:15.879
four-and-a-half somersault

0:23:18.249,0:23:24.440
spin speed going on there that's a three

0:23:21.109,0:23:29.329
point seven tariff as well not afraid to

0:23:24.440,0:23:35.779
put the tough dives in early he's got a

0:23:29.329,0:23:37.269
four point one coming later they did

0:23:35.779,0:23:40.329
roll over

0:23:37.269,0:23:43.609
it's a lot of somersaults to get through

0:23:40.329,0:23:48.069
in time to spot the water and get

0:23:43.609,0:23:48.069
yourself vertical and square so but 81.4

0:23:49.149,0:23:54.679
seventh the united states have had a bit

0:23:53.119,0:23:57.619
of their diving revival in these games

0:23:54.679,0:23:59.419
with such a huge early tradition in the

0:23:57.619,0:24:01.699
olympic games coming from the states

0:23:59.419,0:24:03.919
Nick McCrory has a bronze to take home

0:24:01.699,0:24:06.919
in the ten metre synchro with David

0:24:03.919,0:24:12.009
Boudia who's to dive in a few minutes

0:24:06.919,0:24:12.009
but he gets a chance to open his program

0:24:13.599,0:24:17.919
in with three and a half somersaults

0:24:20.130,0:24:26.500
well well my zeroes flash gets a warm

0:24:24.159,0:24:28.450
round of applause here from the crowd

0:24:26.500,0:24:31.450
that's will be reasonably neutral until

0:24:28.450,0:24:33.760
the British divers come up he can show

0:24:31.450,0:24:36.909
that bronze medal to his uncle the

0:24:33.760,0:24:38.530
British swimmer who in 1976 picked up

0:24:36.909,0:24:41.590
bronze in the 800 freestyle Gordon

0:24:38.530,0:24:47.919
Downey course Nick McCrory representing

0:24:41.590,0:24:52.419
the USA at a seventy six point eight

0:24:47.919,0:24:54.280
more than respectable announcer just

0:24:52.419,0:24:56.110
asking the enthusiastic crowd to turn

0:24:54.280,0:25:00.220
off the flash guns in their camera

0:24:56.110,0:25:02.500
phones and phones their cameras they

0:25:00.220,0:25:04.179
brought to record the events for now

0:25:02.500,0:25:05.770
there is quite enough light in here and

0:25:04.179,0:25:09.390
you don't distract me

0:25:05.770,0:25:12.450
the divers chose a carer from Cuba

0:25:09.390,0:25:14.500
getting on with his dive very sharply

0:25:12.450,0:25:16.780
indeed forward three and a half

0:25:14.500,0:25:19.360
somersault a little too quickly perhaps

0:25:16.780,0:25:25.120
there's the feet just slipped over at

0:25:19.360,0:25:27.730
the end of this one will be penalized

0:25:25.120,0:25:33.640
for that with six and a half sand sevens

0:25:27.730,0:25:35.110
a shame a lot only other parts of that

0:25:33.640,0:25:37.179
dive were nice but that last impression

0:25:35.110,0:25:38.530
is just vital it a bit and was we

0:25:37.179,0:25:40.630
compared with gymnastics that's like

0:25:38.530,0:25:42.549
sticking the landing after a tough

0:25:40.630,0:25:44.860
routine if you don't get the entry right

0:25:42.549,0:25:47.130
the judges have just left with a bad

0:25:44.860,0:25:47.130
impression

0:25:47.909,0:25:53.830
Sebastian via next from Colombia back

0:25:51.760,0:25:56.770
two and a half somersault one and a half

0:25:53.830,0:26:02.080
twist that's a three point two degree of

0:25:56.770,0:26:06.669
difficulty or very nice

0:26:02.080,0:26:08.019
a bronze medal in the Pan Am Games and

0:26:06.669,0:26:10.659
the 10-meter platform last year in

0:26:08.019,0:26:15.399
Guadalajara that's a sports festival

0:26:10.659,0:26:18.820
that's of gaining in prestige and is

0:26:15.399,0:26:24.960
attracting eights and that's a top-ten

0:26:18.820,0:26:24.960
dive at the moment still plenty to come

0:26:28.800,0:26:35.300
make start one of the big hitters as we

0:26:32.520,0:26:37.050
just see those marks confirmed there

0:26:35.300,0:26:42.030
David Boudia

0:26:37.050,0:26:45.840
from the United States bronze in the 10

0:26:42.030,0:26:48.809
metre synchro find foot 9 a much bigger

0:26:45.840,0:26:51.510
build diver of some of the 5 4 5 5 s

0:26:48.809,0:26:53.610
that we've seen already arm stands back

0:26:51.510,0:26:57.750
double somersault two and a half twists

0:26:53.610,0:27:07.740
three point six and opening the show

0:26:57.750,0:27:09.179
with a big number okay and be glad it's

0:27:07.740,0:27:12.960
got a big tariff because there were a

0:27:09.179,0:27:15.450
couple of small problems there done well

0:27:12.960,0:27:17.580
this was a dive that had the chance to

0:27:15.450,0:27:19.140
be up there in the top three but you

0:27:17.580,0:27:24.360
just observed that the biggest splash

0:27:19.140,0:27:27.090
there he likes the difficult dives he

0:27:24.360,0:27:30.750
chose the highest degree of difficulty

0:27:27.090,0:27:33.570
in the finals in 2008 in this event and

0:27:30.750,0:27:37.020
finished 10th so he likes to challenge

0:27:33.570,0:27:39.390
himself obviously first u.s. diver have

0:27:37.020,0:27:46.140
scores 600 plus points under the current

0:27:39.390,0:27:48.570
scoring system 8 now here's the star

0:27:46.140,0:27:52.940
possibly the the favorite Kubo from

0:27:48.570,0:27:52.940
China the world champion

0:27:59.430,0:28:07.750
in would three-and-a-half somersault to

0:28:02.140,0:28:12.700
put down his first marker his teammate

0:28:07.750,0:28:17.280
Lin is sitting in third position always

0:28:12.700,0:28:19.900
very tidy or the judges like it

0:28:17.280,0:28:23.050
and so frightening ly close to the

0:28:19.900,0:28:26.380
platform very vertical position slightly

0:28:23.050,0:28:34.510
bigger splash than perhaps he likes but

0:28:26.380,0:28:36.310
in 2/3 some of the big hitters have

0:28:34.510,0:28:38.470
ended up down the bottom end of this in

0:28:36.310,0:28:40.150
the in the draw for the dive order

0:28:38.470,0:28:44.610
they'll be seeded after tonight of

0:28:40.150,0:28:49.150
course this is Sasha Klein from Germany

0:28:44.610,0:28:51.070
twice European champion at 10 meters in

0:28:49.150,0:28:58.690
with three and a half somersault to

0:28:51.070,0:29:02.350
begin I've seen a few of these dives in

0:28:58.690,0:29:03.900
this first series and I'm too much

0:29:02.350,0:29:11.290
better than this one from Sasha Klein

0:29:03.900,0:29:15.670
very tidy very clean on entry 26 years

0:29:11.290,0:29:17.830
of age very experienced 8 golds and two

0:29:15.670,0:29:20.140
silvers at European Championship level

0:29:17.830,0:29:24.160
but this of course is very much a level

0:29:20.140,0:29:28.030
up but good opening 81.6 a popular score

0:29:24.160,0:29:31.330
in this first series and four other four

0:29:28.030,0:29:34.270
divers that on that score podium cap

0:29:31.330,0:29:37.120
tour from belarus another one of the

0:29:34.270,0:29:39.360
bigger eastern european divers at 5 foot

0:29:37.120,0:29:39.360
9

0:29:40.519,0:29:44.690
he did have a head injury last year and

0:29:42.919,0:29:48.200
in June when he hit the platform while

0:29:44.690,0:29:55.239
training with his apartment Tim I found

0:29:48.200,0:29:57.379
water check but this is a beautiful dive

0:29:55.239,0:29:59.450
take some courage to come back but

0:29:57.379,0:30:02.119
where's the splash he couldn't make one

0:29:59.450,0:30:04.279
and there's 72 the difficulty just down

0:30:02.119,0:30:07.849
a little that's why he's not our partner

0:30:04.279,0:30:10.639
in the high 70s the crowd as you can

0:30:07.849,0:30:15.019
hear already cheering because up on the

0:30:10.639,0:30:17.089
board is a great home hero Tom Daley

0:30:15.019,0:30:19.789
from Great Britain one of the poster

0:30:17.089,0:30:24.619
boys of the whole London 2012 Olympic

0:30:19.789,0:30:28.029
Games still only 18 years of age his

0:30:24.619,0:30:31.279
second Olympics so much expectation on

0:30:28.029,0:30:33.229
Tom Daley back two and a half somersault

0:30:31.279,0:30:44.899
two and a half twists and that's a three

0:30:33.229,0:30:46.459
point six to start with you know I would

0:30:44.899,0:30:48.709
like him to have done better so that the

0:30:46.459,0:30:51.769
crowd had a bit more to influence the

0:30:48.709,0:30:56.209
judges with but you saw the splash over

0:30:51.769,0:30:59.749
it came he's so clean through the air

0:30:56.209,0:31:03.379
but just let it go at the end and the

0:30:59.749,0:31:05.119
splash won't convince the judges that

0:31:03.379,0:31:09.679
this was a jet and a diver was in

0:31:05.119,0:31:12.109
control finished fourth in the 10 metre

0:31:09.679,0:31:14.359
synchro doing brilliantly in the first

0:31:12.109,0:31:15.739
three dives and then they've got the

0:31:14.359,0:31:18.469
fourth one wrong when it cost them

0:31:15.739,0:31:20.779
dearly cost him a medal he just has to

0:31:18.469,0:31:22.909
settle down and make sure he qualifies

0:31:20.779,0:31:25.070
and look to build through his through

0:31:22.909,0:31:29.450
his campaign he's not gonna win it

0:31:25.070,0:31:31.219
tonight but you can lose it it's not a

0:31:29.450,0:31:33.349
disastrous start but it's not a

0:31:31.219,0:31:38.749
confidence building one either she

0:31:33.349,0:31:41.559
oughta be mean from Italy in with three

0:31:38.749,0:31:41.559
and a half somersault

0:31:42.299,0:31:48.700
yep well some youth perhaps exposed with

0:31:46.210,0:31:51.999
his opening dovey his hips a little bent

0:31:48.700,0:31:55.960
on entry and the splash the world

0:31:51.999,0:31:57.970
sizable he got through somersaults well

0:31:55.960,0:32:01.259
enough but didn't straighten out quickly

0:31:57.970,0:32:03.610
enough it's still only 17 he was

0:32:01.259,0:32:05.620
outstanding in the European Youth

0:32:03.610,0:32:08.080
Championships in Budapest when he was

0:32:05.620,0:32:09.220
only 14 years of age and straightaway

0:32:08.080,0:32:12.129
was pitched in to the World

0:32:09.220,0:32:15.610
Championships in Rome in 2009 so he's

0:32:12.129,0:32:19.659
grown up in competition really second

0:32:15.610,0:32:21.759
last diver in this first series who go

0:32:19.659,0:32:26.350
Parisi from Brazil his third Olympic

0:32:21.759,0:32:28.330
Games forward three and a half

0:32:26.350,0:32:30.999
somersault made of a clean sound the

0:32:28.330,0:32:34.269
sound is almost an indication as much as

0:32:30.999,0:32:38.080
a sight you'll get good marks here but

0:32:34.269,0:32:40.720
with a 3.0 tariff you can't expect to

0:32:38.080,0:32:45.999
collect to bigger score nice entry down

0:32:40.720,0:32:49.809
from hugo top 15 one to come another big

0:32:45.999,0:32:52.690
cheer it's the other british diver Peter

0:32:49.809,0:32:56.289
Waterfield Tom Daley synchro partner

0:32:52.690,0:32:59.769
he's the older of the two by far age 31

0:32:56.289,0:33:02.110
and a local boy born in Walthamstow

0:32:59.769,0:33:06.090
which is just a few miles away in East

0:33:02.110,0:33:08.110
London we'll got plenty of experience

0:33:06.090,0:33:10.919
water-filled is well known really for

0:33:08.110,0:33:10.919
aquatic supporters

0:33:13.080,0:33:18.480
he's opening dive is an arm stand back

0:33:15.940,0:33:30.900
triple somersault three point three

0:33:18.480,0:33:30.900
tucked position very nice good start

0:33:31.320,0:33:35.430
it's his fourth Olympic Games so he

0:33:33.570,0:33:38.250
knows what this level of competition is

0:33:35.430,0:33:41.040
all about kick-out to start that

0:33:38.250,0:33:43.170
handstand I must hold that handstand to

0:33:41.040,0:33:48.350
show that the judges you were in control

0:33:43.170,0:33:51.540
biggest splash he's not a small man

0:33:48.350,0:33:53.780
powerfully-built not tall

0:33:51.540,0:33:58.280
165 centimeters but

0:33:53.780,0:34:00.870
very compact isn't he and a 66 repeater

0:33:58.280,0:34:03.180
room to improve and he'll need to in

0:34:00.870,0:34:06.480
this hot field and that completes the

0:34:03.180,0:34:08.280
first series of dives it's a long

0:34:06.480,0:34:10.500
scoreboard to give you but right at the

0:34:08.280,0:34:13.530
top there German Sanchez cleared

0:34:10.500,0:34:18.060
galperin and the two Chinese divers Lin

0:34:13.530,0:34:20.520
UA and Kubo both right up there Vaughn

0:34:18.060,0:34:22.590
da Sasha Klein some experienced divers

0:34:20.520,0:34:25.230
now maybe one or two who might have been

0:34:22.590,0:34:31.100
hoping for more like Matthew Mitchum and

0:34:25.230,0:34:33.690
David Boudia and Nick McCrory but this

0:34:31.100,0:34:36.750
these differences in points can be

0:34:33.690,0:34:39.780
caught up fairly quickly Tom Daly on the

0:34:36.750,0:34:46.050
line they're in 18th position he will be

0:34:39.780,0:34:47.910
believing he can only get better they'll

0:34:46.050,0:34:49.350
feel a lot better though from having got

0:34:47.910,0:34:53.010
into the competition got that first

0:34:49.350,0:34:55.020
nervous dive out of the way and start to

0:34:53.010,0:34:57.180
settle into their their routines as

0:34:55.020,0:34:58.830
we've said thirty two divers means it's

0:34:57.180,0:35:01.560
sort of a long evening when you're in a

0:34:58.830,0:35:02.910
final with just 12 then you're you're in

0:35:01.560,0:35:05.130
the water quickly and the whole

0:35:02.910,0:35:06.480
competition gets a lot more momentum

0:35:05.130,0:35:08.700
though the organization here is

0:35:06.480,0:35:09.900
excellent how swiftly they get them

0:35:08.700,0:35:12.530
standing at different levels of the

0:35:09.900,0:35:16.470
board and ready to go and keep the

0:35:12.530,0:35:19.800
entertainment going just under half an

0:35:16.470,0:35:23.040
hour for the first 32 dive so we can

0:35:19.800,0:35:24.530
expect half an hour per per dive per

0:35:23.040,0:35:27.060
series if you like

0:35:24.530,0:35:32.300
Alperin gets ready for exams down I

0:35:27.060,0:35:38.040
understand reverse triple age 27 born in

0:35:32.300,0:35:42.720
Moscow five foot nine terrible injury

0:35:38.040,0:35:44.460
problems we've had eight operations on

0:35:42.720,0:35:48.030
his back and knee and didn't compete in

0:35:44.460,0:35:50.640
2010 and 2011 it broke his leg as well

0:35:48.030,0:35:52.680
back in 2006 this is a dangerous sport

0:35:50.640,0:35:54.120
yeah and no wonder he thought about

0:35:52.680,0:35:55.620
their flagging it all away but his

0:35:54.120,0:35:59.040
family convinced him he should keep

0:35:55.620,0:36:02.760
going and he's had a very good second

0:35:59.040,0:36:03.900
dive here to confirm his position near

0:36:02.760,0:36:08.210
the top of the standings

0:36:03.900,0:36:11.130
- good dies from glib galperin

0:36:08.210,0:36:14.160
maybe these older more experienced

0:36:11.130,0:36:17.580
divers can bring that extra measure of

0:36:14.160,0:36:21.270
composure to their performance that's

0:36:17.580,0:36:23.790
the first dive man in the 90s Lin you

0:36:21.270,0:36:27.540
eight verse three and a half somersault

0:36:23.790,0:36:31.050
oh he's a little short on the entry

0:36:27.540,0:36:37.160
they're beautiful through the year as

0:36:31.050,0:36:41.660
always is that top Chinese divers see he

0:36:37.160,0:36:41.660
just didn't kick out early enough and

0:36:41.690,0:36:46.770
he's not vertical at all although

0:36:44.520,0:36:48.810
somehow he manages to make such a small

0:36:46.770,0:36:53.160
splash that's great control underneath

0:36:48.810,0:36:58.050
the water to pull that bubble down with

0:36:53.160,0:36:59.580
him like many of the divers here they

0:36:58.050,0:37:02.250
did take the chance to get a feel of the

0:36:59.580,0:37:04.320
pool by competing in a world cup event

0:37:02.250,0:37:06.600
which was held here at the Aquatic

0:37:04.320,0:37:10.980
Centre in February where he finished

0:37:06.600,0:37:12.420
sixth victor tiger somebody who really

0:37:10.980,0:37:15.360
likes to get on with it once he gets up

0:37:12.420,0:37:18.920
on that board he hears he'll help move

0:37:15.360,0:37:22.490
the competition along and his own way

0:37:18.920,0:37:22.490
forward three and a half

0:37:25.350,0:37:32.140
again really the only problem here that

0:37:27.810,0:37:42.070
the divers mostly have is ripping that

0:37:32.140,0:37:45.580
entry 67 and a half for Victor Anton

0:37:42.070,0:37:51.940
zakharov World Championships silver and

0:37:45.580,0:37:55.030
bronze in the synchro events 26 year old

0:37:51.940,0:38:01.120
with his second dive back three and a

0:37:55.030,0:38:04.800
half somersault very good control the

0:38:01.120,0:38:11.560
entry beautifully some strength earrings

0:38:04.800,0:38:13.770
Christie's team got a bit of ground to

0:38:11.560,0:38:19.870
make up really from his opening dive

0:38:13.770,0:38:20.800
very tight there chest and thighs

0:38:19.870,0:38:22.510
together

0:38:20.800,0:38:24.460
some of them grip all the way round the

0:38:22.510,0:38:26.140
back of their their legs they wanted to

0:38:24.460,0:38:27.640
them just like to hold it more to the

0:38:26.140,0:38:30.160
side but you can't really pull it in

0:38:27.640,0:38:31.690
can't you yes no good shot there under

0:38:30.160,0:38:33.640
the water the way they spread their arms

0:38:31.690,0:38:36.760
out that helps to pull the air down with

0:38:33.640,0:38:44.380
them the bubbles and then create a

0:38:36.760,0:38:44.980
better entry Timofey hold a cheek stand

0:38:44.380,0:38:47.680
back

0:38:44.980,0:38:50.650
triple somersault tucks three point

0:38:47.680,0:38:55.170
three the difficulty here which is as

0:38:50.650,0:38:55.170
high as his tariffs of dives go

0:38:58.510,0:39:03.700
Odia that was

0:39:01.720,0:39:10.420
that wasn't so special and the crowd

0:39:03.700,0:39:11.940
quite muted with their applause these

0:39:10.420,0:39:15.609
dives do give an impression without

0:39:11.940,0:39:17.200
actually analyzed them into elements all

0:39:15.609,0:39:19.210
the way down which the judges are doing

0:39:17.200,0:39:20.830
so the crowd the good crowd here very

0:39:19.210,0:39:23.920
quickly getting a feel for what's gonna

0:39:20.830,0:39:26.200
go down well by the size of the splash

0:39:23.920,0:39:27.700
although nothing there was the giveaway

0:39:26.200,0:39:29.140
for the crowd and the fours four and a

0:39:27.700,0:39:34.930
half sets that's tough for their chick

0:39:29.140,0:39:37.300
to come back from four more dives though

0:39:34.930,0:39:41.980
it can be done it's just you make it

0:39:37.300,0:39:43.450
hard for yourself put pressure on all

0:39:41.980,0:39:45.040
these divers have to qualify for this

0:39:43.450,0:39:46.630
competition either through the world

0:39:45.040,0:39:49.630
championships last year or being

0:39:46.630,0:39:54.520
Continental champion this is re here on

0:39:49.630,0:39:56.200
jus or having dived at the World Cup so

0:39:54.520,0:40:03.760
they will all earn the right to be here

0:39:56.200,0:40:05.859
very tidy through the year the second

0:40:03.760,0:40:09.490
jump off the platform is the toes lift

0:40:05.859,0:40:13.270
and then came on again and splash not

0:40:09.490,0:40:15.220
quite right the feet they've got to pull

0:40:13.270,0:40:17.260
out of that rotation and the speed they

0:40:15.220,0:40:18.970
generate then and that's where the the

0:40:17.260,0:40:20.470
core strength and those stomach muscles

0:40:18.970,0:40:22.480
really come into play where they've got

0:40:20.470,0:40:28.210
to basically put the brakes on in midair

0:40:22.480,0:40:29.560
mmm James Conner made a nervous start I

0:40:28.210,0:40:34.510
think it's fair to say with an opening

0:40:29.560,0:40:36.580
66 he was another one who was injured

0:40:34.510,0:40:39.190
back in 2010 and trained for a long time

0:40:36.580,0:40:40.780
with back pain 18 months it went on

0:40:39.190,0:40:43.750
eventually he had to give himself a rest

0:40:40.780,0:40:46.800
but he's back now back three and a half

0:40:43.750,0:40:46.800
somersault tucked

0:40:55.920,0:41:01.440
very nice a big improvement on his first

0:40:59.170,0:41:09.609
day particularly with the entry from

0:41:01.440,0:41:12.940
17-year old looks like he might have a

0:41:09.609,0:41:15.190
couple of risky issues as well after all

0:41:12.940,0:41:19.869
these divers learn to cope with injury

0:41:15.190,0:41:21.279
and compete with it if they can this is

0:41:19.869,0:41:23.559
really going to lift his school and saw

0:41:21.279,0:41:24.609
that the Tuck is quite split but does

0:41:23.559,0:41:30.279
allow them to go through the air a bit

0:41:24.609,0:41:34.930
more quickly seventy nine point two that

0:41:30.279,0:41:36.369
to picked up a few barks there tell by

0:41:34.930,0:41:39.700
his body language he feels a bit more

0:41:36.369,0:41:44.969
encouraged there Martin Wolfram from

0:41:39.700,0:41:44.969
Germany 20 year old

0:41:53.160,0:42:00.940
now 77.4 was his opening dive you're

0:41:59.230,0:42:04.510
starting to get a feel for what are the

0:42:00.940,0:42:06.870
kind of marks we can see helping the

0:42:04.510,0:42:11.650
divers progressed in the next round

0:42:06.870,0:42:13.780
dickish splash semi final will be

0:42:11.650,0:42:15.520
progress for him he competed at the

0:42:13.780,0:42:17.650
World Championships last year that was

0:42:15.520,0:42:20.380
his first really big international

0:42:17.650,0:42:23.220
competition finished 20th so he's

0:42:20.380,0:42:25.840
getting the top 18 here that would be a

0:42:23.220,0:42:29.800
good games for him and then you never

0:42:25.840,0:42:33.670
know young Claire

0:42:29.800,0:42:35.680
Aguilar of Cuba this is the the inward

0:42:33.670,0:42:38.190
three and a half we saw a lot of in the

0:42:35.680,0:42:38.190
first series

0:42:49.560,0:42:57.390
Oh beautiful agreed hey he only had a 61

0:42:55.380,0:42:59.580
and a half with his first dive and he

0:42:57.390,0:43:03.590
kept that in so tied to the platform and

0:42:59.580,0:43:03.590
just take your breath away watch here oh

0:43:04.040,0:43:08.700
but it allows him to get that more

0:43:07.200,0:43:10.290
vertical position he's not pushing out

0:43:08.700,0:43:11.460
too far away from the platform him

0:43:10.290,0:43:14.040
you're brave enough to keep it in that

0:43:11.460,0:43:17.000
close you can get more vertical and he

0:43:14.040,0:43:19.200
has taken some reward for his risk

0:43:17.000,0:43:21.540
it's a highly mouth moment there when

0:43:19.200,0:43:23.820
you look at those replays and it all

0:43:21.540,0:43:25.890
happened so quickly the replays really

0:43:23.820,0:43:29.160
give you the chance to appreciate the

0:43:25.890,0:43:30.810
sheer courage of these of these divers

0:43:29.160,0:43:33.840
they know what they're doing but even so

0:43:30.810,0:43:37.110
it's a 25 point improvement on with his

0:43:33.840,0:43:45.690
second dive agree Alexandre Banda now

0:43:37.110,0:43:47.130
from Ukraine flying himself into that

0:43:45.690,0:43:49.320
dive you do tend to get the Eastern

0:43:47.130,0:43:53.250
Europeans to really attack it in that

0:43:49.320,0:43:55.110
almost aggressive way he's jumping way

0:43:53.250,0:43:56.400
out into the pool here and that just

0:43:55.110,0:43:58.260
makes it a little tougher to get that

0:43:56.400,0:44:00.300
vertical position at a nice contrast

0:43:58.260,0:44:02.850
really to the previous diver with what

0:44:00.300,0:44:05.430
we're talking about getting into the

0:44:02.850,0:44:07.110
water at the right angle four and a half

0:44:05.430,0:44:08.760
somersaults he's got to generate there

0:44:07.110,0:44:10.860
he's got to get the the height and the

0:44:08.760,0:44:13.710
speed going has linked and then put

0:44:10.860,0:44:15.240
those brakes on 83 to five though with

0:44:13.710,0:44:25.770
that difficulty of three seven that

0:44:15.240,0:44:28.920
really helps Jihu Park from career in

0:44:25.770,0:44:31.130
with three and a half somersault he's

0:44:28.920,0:44:35.330
got work to do to try and make the cut

0:44:31.130,0:44:35.330
18 remember to go through

0:44:36.850,0:44:42.550
quick yeah and little under-rotated at

0:44:40.090,0:44:44.470
the finish to create that big splash but

0:44:42.550,0:44:47.260
again a little gasp from the crowd as

0:44:44.470,0:44:50.080
you see how tidy is to the board there I

0:44:47.260,0:44:51.640
think that he's here might have touched

0:44:50.080,0:44:57.580
the platform but fortunately not his

0:44:51.640,0:45:02.650
head they're all fine

0:44:57.580,0:45:12.790
kicks it out but over does it and that's

0:45:02.650,0:45:19.090
the giveaway splash 467 to make 10 mini

0:45:12.790,0:45:25.690
buyers also a three meter

0:45:19.090,0:45:29.020
diver as well sick from the 10 meter

0:45:25.690,0:45:35.230
synchro though already so he's got a

0:45:29.020,0:45:38.200
feel of the occasion very good this is

0:45:35.230,0:45:41.410
his toughest dive where 3.7 terror of

0:45:38.200,0:45:46.360
them he's got a couple of three sixes in

0:45:41.410,0:45:48.580
there as well fairly savage cut after

0:45:46.360,0:45:52.770
this after the preliminaries they almost

0:45:48.580,0:45:52.770
cut the field in half from 32 to 18

0:45:56.590,0:46:01.720
camera that slides down the pole and

0:45:58.630,0:46:04.080
gives you that look and some sense of

0:46:01.720,0:46:04.080
the pace

0:46:04.970,0:46:10.069
maybe six nine five so into the top five

0:46:08.329,0:46:13.460
for the moment but plenty of dives to

0:46:10.069,0:46:15.470
come in this second lot next up German

0:46:13.460,0:46:17.630
Sanchez the synchro silver medalist

0:46:15.470,0:46:25.310
likes this pool he was here in February

0:46:17.630,0:46:27.589
and got a silver there as well for the

0:46:25.310,0:46:31.550
two and a half somersault three twists

0:46:27.589,0:46:35.510
there was plenty of difficulty involved

0:46:31.550,0:46:40.130
with the three point eight tariff and

0:46:35.510,0:46:42.310
opened up of course with an 89 won he

0:46:40.130,0:46:47.450
helped me at the top of the standings to

0:46:42.310,0:46:53.150
the feet rolling over he's not going to

0:46:47.450,0:46:55.849
replicate that difficulty will help an

0:46:53.150,0:46:59.119
awful lot took control during that dive

0:46:55.849,0:47:01.150
and he just couldn't manage to quite

0:46:59.119,0:47:05.750
hold the right entry position there

0:47:01.150,0:47:10.280
maybe one seven still there about in

0:47:05.750,0:47:13.940
good shape to progress Riley McCormick

0:47:10.280,0:47:18.650
from Canada down in 19th place so he's

0:47:13.940,0:47:20.480
just below the cut needs to keep

0:47:18.650,0:47:26.480
improving back two and a half somersault

0:47:20.480,0:47:31.060
two and a half twists three point six

0:47:26.480,0:47:31.060
this one so he can make up ground here

0:47:33.530,0:47:37.200
[Applause]

0:47:35.020,0:47:41.700
few Canadians in the crowd perhaps

0:47:37.200,0:47:41.700
letting the judges know they approve a

0:47:43.260,0:47:47.770
little bit of loss of leg form at the

0:47:46.150,0:47:49.080
top of that dive the ankles should have

0:47:47.770,0:47:52.660
come together a bit quicker than that

0:47:49.080,0:47:55.870
and just a moderate sized splash here

0:47:52.660,0:47:58.090
his ankles are all over the place so he

0:47:55.870,0:48:00.550
didn't really capitalize on the

0:47:58.090,0:48:02.200
difficulty there 79 - though more than

0:48:00.550,0:48:08.170
respectable assistance

0:48:02.200,0:48:13.140
it could have been more coach being put

0:48:08.170,0:48:16.630
in his place Matthew Mitchum the

0:48:13.140,0:48:18.580
defending champion he feels that the

0:48:16.630,0:48:20.460
injuries he's had in recent years has

0:48:18.580,0:48:23.530
made him one of the underdogs here

0:48:20.460,0:48:30.510
tonight turned he is quite happy with

0:48:23.530,0:48:32.980
that back three and a half somersault

0:48:30.510,0:48:35.020
that should have improved his position

0:48:32.980,0:48:37.570
you think and three point three the

0:48:35.020,0:48:39.400
tariff I don't think we've seen this

0:48:37.570,0:48:42.100
dive yet from anyone else

0:48:39.400,0:48:44.800
and it's almost a blind kick out isn't

0:48:42.100,0:48:49.020
it you gotta try and reach that vertical

0:48:44.800,0:48:49.020
position with a little less to go by

0:48:50.100,0:49:00.100
it's the defending Olympic champion of

0:48:52.660,0:49:02.490
course so much expected of him and 74 to

0:49:00.100,0:49:02.490
5

0:49:04.869,0:49:10.280
his mervich didn't muck around Roger

0:49:07.369,0:49:12.339
right into it it's very noticeable have

0:49:10.280,0:49:14.599
someone to really compose themselves and

0:49:12.339,0:49:16.039
while we're watching the replays and

0:49:14.599,0:49:17.960
getting those results of course the

0:49:16.039,0:49:19.490
officials quickly get them moving up

0:49:17.960,0:49:24.260
there and ready to go and some of them

0:49:19.490,0:49:27.260
really are ready to go very nice entry

0:49:24.260,0:49:29.119
from gives mervich trains in sweden

0:49:27.260,0:49:31.480
there's no 10 metre platform facility in

0:49:29.119,0:49:31.480
Norway

0:49:33.160,0:49:38.839
[Music]

0:49:34.960,0:49:39.740
he's a bit of a trailblazer for Norway

0:49:38.839,0:49:42.890
they're in the diving

0:49:39.740,0:49:46.539
unlike francesco de Lomo italy have had

0:49:42.890,0:49:51.500
their stars in the past his second dive

0:49:46.539,0:49:54.140
forward three and a half somersault well

0:49:51.500,0:49:56.270
another impressive entry and just a

0:49:54.140,0:49:57.859
sense that the standard is now starting

0:49:56.270,0:50:01.670
to lift midway through this second

0:49:57.859,0:50:04.609
series that knows not quite on the knees

0:50:01.670,0:50:08.299
but the real impression is with the

0:50:04.609,0:50:09.859
entry and it was our beauty and so eight

0:50:08.299,0:50:11.630
eight now there's a couple of nines in

0:50:09.859,0:50:16.700
there as well they might get rejected

0:50:11.630,0:50:19.359
but they will in fact overall though did

0:50:16.700,0:50:19.359
he help the effort

0:50:20.700,0:50:26.920
seventy-six ninth lost the two nines of

0:50:25.060,0:50:29.020
course in the scoring system as you can

0:50:26.920,0:50:34.450
see them being crossed out there now

0:50:29.020,0:50:37.900
Christopher s Kilson from Sweden in with

0:50:34.450,0:50:40.150
three and a half a somersault 13th in

0:50:37.900,0:50:43.710
round one so it'll be reasonably

0:50:40.150,0:50:43.710
encouraged by his opening dive

0:50:49.910,0:50:53.300
right entry

0:50:53.700,0:51:05.760
a second look here very tight tuck

0:51:01.410,0:51:08.310
position spots the water not quite 100%

0:51:05.760,0:51:11.390
vertical but so you need a second look

0:51:08.310,0:51:13.620
to see that it's all about the entry

0:51:11.390,0:51:15.530
he's competed at the last two World

0:51:13.620,0:51:18.240
Championships and never gone out of the

0:51:15.530,0:51:20.340
qualifying stage so he's giving himself

0:51:18.240,0:51:24.440
a bit of a chance here perhaps seventy

0:51:20.340,0:51:26.660
six eight he's in equal seventh position

0:51:24.440,0:51:29.520
moving up from 13th

0:51:26.660,0:51:30.180
now Eric Sain did not get off to a great

0:51:29.520,0:51:32.670
start

0:51:30.180,0:51:34.980
he was right down the bottom of the

0:51:32.670,0:51:37.860
pecking order in 30th inward three and a

0:51:34.980,0:51:42.440
half somersaults and he needs to get

0:51:37.860,0:51:42.440
this a lot more impressively

0:51:48.409,0:51:52.829
well maybe it was better but it needed

0:51:51.509,0:51:59.729
to be better than that

0:51:52.829,0:52:02.429
if I can put it as simply as that these

0:51:59.729,0:52:05.219
divers he was taken along to the pool by

0:52:02.429,0:52:07.289
mum or dad and they have a swim gym

0:52:05.219,0:52:08.819
program in Canada that he turned up at

0:52:07.289,0:52:12.959
one day and thought he rather liked it

0:52:08.819,0:52:15.029
and his diving career took off as Steve

0:52:12.959,0:52:16.859
said a lot of these divers progressed

0:52:15.029,0:52:20.309
from gymnastics or trampolining one or

0:52:16.859,0:52:21.809
two have had injuries and think rather

0:52:20.309,0:52:23.909
mistakenly this might be a slightly

0:52:21.809,0:52:27.449
can't be a softer option can it's a

0:52:23.909,0:52:33.079
different option we'll say 62 for

0:52:27.449,0:52:33.079
therefore Eric same move on to us

0:52:33.919,0:52:40.650
forward four and a half somersault tucks

0:52:36.419,0:52:42.179
there 3.7 the tariff he's named in part

0:52:40.650,0:52:43.459
after one of your great footballers

0:52:42.179,0:52:45.929
there Bryan Robson

0:52:43.459,0:52:49.679
so he's dead must be a huge football fan

0:52:45.929,0:52:51.479
Nick in Malaysia Bryan Robson wouldn't

0:52:49.679,0:52:52.739
have held back I can tell you that he'd

0:52:51.479,0:52:54.929
have been diving he really would have

0:52:52.739,0:52:56.400
given it the full face of the bat and

0:52:54.929,0:52:58.140
the trouble for this Brian was that he

0:52:56.400,0:52:59.640
wasn't it didn't quite straighten out

0:52:58.140,0:53:03.019
the legs below the hips here and he's

0:52:59.640,0:53:03.019
come in a bit of an angle

0:53:04.459,0:53:10.890
Malaysia never won an Olympic gold medal

0:53:07.650,0:53:13.469
before these games so it'd be a great

0:53:10.890,0:53:15.509
incentive but might still be in the

0:53:13.469,0:53:17.640
dreams perhaps he's second I'll just

0:53:15.509,0:53:23.989
letting him down a little as we move

0:53:17.640,0:53:26.819
swiftly on even Garcia up in ninth place

0:53:23.989,0:53:31.199
right on the edge of that board back

0:53:26.819,0:53:33.089
three and a half somersault that in

0:53:31.199,0:53:35.449
itself a real test of nerve for most

0:53:33.089,0:53:40.229
people

0:53:35.449,0:53:41.489
all very good but they do have to take

0:53:40.229,0:53:43.469
their time in that position and make

0:53:41.489,0:53:47.039
sure they've got the composure right on

0:53:43.469,0:53:49.049
the edge of the board they're no spring

0:53:47.039,0:53:51.989
to be had out of concrete so they really

0:53:49.049,0:53:53.759
need the power out of the legs and he

0:53:51.989,0:53:57.119
has controlled that entry beautifully

0:53:53.759,0:54:00.179
fancier and he's getting it a sprinkling

0:53:57.119,0:54:03.779
of nines for this dive which will really

0:54:00.179,0:54:06.059
move him up the standings third it's a

0:54:03.779,0:54:07.739
great camera angle that Top Shot looking

0:54:06.059,0:54:10.019
right down and really gives you an idea

0:54:07.739,0:54:11.809
of the view from the top there which is

0:54:10.019,0:54:14.869
formidable

0:54:11.809,0:54:17.880
Nick McCrory from the United States

0:54:14.869,0:54:18.949
armed stands back double somersault one

0:54:17.880,0:54:24.829
and a half twist

0:54:18.949,0:54:27.269
he's 13th equal this in itself for a

0:54:24.829,0:54:34.559
test getting right to the edge of that

0:54:27.269,0:54:36.769
board basically three stories up in the

0:54:34.559,0:54:36.769
air

0:54:49.750,0:54:54.650
agonizing wench at the top was was I

0:54:52.550,0:54:56.630
just thought is he in control here as he

0:54:54.650,0:54:58.520
got all his thoughts together but the

0:54:56.630,0:55:00.080
execution was fine he did kick out a

0:54:58.520,0:55:01.730
little horizontally and I was wondering

0:55:00.080,0:55:03.860
if he was going to get through all that

0:55:01.730,0:55:06.500
he had to but he reached a beautiful

0:55:03.860,0:55:10.340
position for the entry and it was well

0:55:06.500,0:55:13.550
in control the nerve at the top of that

0:55:10.340,0:55:16.430
board - just hold on hold on until you

0:55:13.550,0:55:18.920
know you're absolutely right we know how

0:55:16.430,0:55:20.450
much they practice but even so in this

0:55:18.920,0:55:22.820
atmosphere with this pressure and

0:55:20.450,0:55:25.270
expectation you really have got to

0:55:22.820,0:55:27.590
admire their skill in their sheer nerve

0:55:25.270,0:55:29.090
putting a towel down quite a few of them

0:55:27.590,0:55:35.570
there just to get that a little bit of

0:55:29.090,0:55:38.150
extra grip and feel Jose Guerra of Cuba

0:55:35.570,0:55:40.160
back three and a half somersault had a

0:55:38.150,0:55:47.360
poor first dive needs this to be good oh

0:55:40.160,0:55:49.640
it's not our dear well your heart goes

0:55:47.360,0:55:52.430
out wasn't it yeah and he's head drops

0:55:49.640,0:55:58.700
he knows all too well that this went

0:55:52.430,0:56:03.200
seriously wrong picked out too early and

0:55:58.700,0:56:05.300
he's almost hit horizontally I did

0:56:03.200,0:56:10.220
complete the dive if you do complete the

0:56:05.300,0:56:12.650
dive he will get a a score like if you

0:56:10.220,0:56:14.690
just sort of opted out half through then

0:56:12.650,0:56:17.720
it will be deemed to be incomplete and

0:56:14.690,0:56:19.340
that is a zero but to be fair the crowd

0:56:17.720,0:56:24.740
were really supportive there I thought

0:56:19.340,0:56:27.350
and sympathetic Sebastian Villar now

0:56:24.740,0:56:28.700
from Colombia the crowd realized that

0:56:27.350,0:56:32.360
what these men are doing they could

0:56:28.700,0:56:35.740
never do so there's that respect in with

0:56:32.360,0:56:35.740
three and a half somersault piked

0:56:36.920,0:56:43.589
man you could start with a 78 for and

0:56:41.520,0:56:46.920
I'll get full value here with some

0:56:43.589,0:56:49.309
problems on the entry like he's formed

0:56:46.920,0:56:56.099
through the air wonderful position their

0:56:49.309,0:56:59.750
spots the water then twists and must be

0:56:56.099,0:56:59.750
square on as well as vertical

0:57:00.970,0:57:06.460
he wasn't quite either 71-75 then

0:57:08.619,0:57:16.119
next up the synchro bronze medalist from

0:57:11.949,0:57:18.359
last week David Boudia who does confess

0:57:16.119,0:57:20.949
that he's been to see sports

0:57:18.359,0:57:25.329
psychologists because doesn't have a

0:57:20.949,0:57:26.859
great deal of confidence with Heights

0:57:25.329,0:57:28.150
which is a bit unfortunate when you're

0:57:26.859,0:57:30.339
standing on the edge of a 10 meter board

0:57:28.150,0:57:36.009
but he's got an in with three and a half

0:57:30.339,0:57:38.890
somersault now I think he's got the

0:57:36.009,0:57:46.209
problem sorted but I'd I'd need the same

0:57:38.890,0:57:48.369
I think he attacked that voted me one of

0:57:46.209,0:57:50.999
the number of divers to score in the 80s

0:57:48.369,0:57:50.999
with his first

0:57:52.230,0:58:02.400
not quite

0:57:54.480,0:58:03.630
so prodigious with his second hands a

0:58:02.400,0:58:05.579
flat as the end of the water they're not

0:58:03.630,0:58:07.320
pointed and that helps create a hole -

0:58:05.579,0:58:11.579
for the body to follow into the water

0:58:07.320,0:58:17.130
with 73 6-4 the diet

0:58:11.579,0:58:22.099
next up the favorite chuubo 25 perfect

0:58:17.130,0:58:27.109
tens when he got a historic 609 20 the

0:58:22.099,0:58:27.109
diving World Series in Beijing last year

0:58:27.800,0:58:36.839
like triple somersault my goodness what

0:58:31.829,0:58:40.950
an entry how does he do it he does it

0:58:36.839,0:58:42.540
with a bow and there was no splash it

0:58:40.950,0:58:47.250
could have been a pea entering the water

0:58:42.540,0:58:52.140
and the judges loved it was a 10 in

0:58:47.250,0:58:54.000
there look at that entry position well a

0:58:52.140,0:58:57.150
couple of those 10th well at the two

0:58:54.000,0:58:59.910
tens unfortunately for him could cast

0:58:57.150,0:59:07.740
aside but it is a very high score to

0:58:59.910,0:59:10.770
boat what an impression to leave 99.75

0:59:07.740,0:59:13.500
they really are poker faced throughout

0:59:10.770,0:59:15.270
their program the Chinese divers they

0:59:13.500,0:59:18.030
really don't like to let their emotions

0:59:15.270,0:59:19.710
come through so controlled all the way

0:59:18.030,0:59:21.540
through the evening and it's a long

0:59:19.710,0:59:23.400
evening for them Sasha Klein now from

0:59:21.540,0:59:26.060
Germany forward four and a half

0:59:23.400,0:59:26.060
somersault

0:59:26.950,0:59:31.329
well he got away with a good entry there

0:59:28.720,0:59:36.700
having not really established a vertical

0:59:31.329,0:59:39.970
position you might feel he's in that

0:59:36.700,0:59:43.269
group outside the big guns challenging

0:59:39.970,0:59:43.569
perhaps for medal honors the next 24

0:59:43.269,0:59:49.150
hours

0:59:43.569,0:59:52.390
passes don't even some ourselves to get

0:59:49.150,0:59:54.730
through good entry just hips slightly

0:59:52.390,1:00:01.660
bent there but 88.8 done you're not

0:59:54.730,1:00:03.789
gonna argue with that kind of mark Klein

1:00:01.660,1:00:09.309
into fourth position at the moment early

1:00:03.789,1:00:12.970
in the prelims Bodine capped or now from

1:00:09.309,1:00:14.890
Belarus with work to do in with three

1:00:12.970,1:00:20.369
and a half somersault with which to make

1:00:14.890,1:00:20.369
some progress three-point to the tariff

1:00:20.970,1:00:25.690
when if TN one of these inward dives

1:00:23.470,1:00:27.490
that has the crowd a little concerned

1:00:25.690,1:00:35.769
about how close he was to the platform

1:00:27.490,1:00:37.670
us to judge it to yourself here makes a

1:00:35.769,1:00:41.909
beautiful entry though

1:00:37.670,1:00:41.909
[Applause]

1:00:43.210,1:00:47.840
while we wait for those very solid marks

1:00:46.369,1:00:50.990
indeed the crown are already getting

1:00:47.840,1:00:54.290
excited because it's Great Britain's Tom

1:00:50.990,1:00:59.200
Daley on the board next and he and

1:00:54.290,1:01:02.119
Jessica Ellis were the two pre-games

1:00:59.200,1:01:04.910
faces that you saw absolutely everywhere

1:01:02.119,1:01:08.180
in the country Jessica's got her gold

1:01:04.910,1:01:11.290
which doubles the pressure on Tom in

1:01:08.180,1:01:15.099
with three and a half somersault tucked

1:01:11.290,1:01:15.099
not really settled yet

1:01:16.720,1:01:21.280
that's better

1:01:18.140,1:01:23.599
only a 73 eight for his first dive it

1:01:21.280,1:01:26.180
can't let the field get away from him

1:01:23.599,1:01:29.869
here almost a third of the way through

1:01:26.180,1:01:33.710
the competition need something in the

1:01:29.869,1:01:35.570
high 70s if he can muster it and he's

1:01:33.710,1:01:38.270
been a star ever since he was 14 years

1:01:35.570,1:01:40.190
of age in Beijing the youngest

1:01:38.270,1:01:42.340
competitor in the team outside of

1:01:40.190,1:01:46.130
swimming Britain's second youngest ever

1:01:42.340,1:01:49.609
olympian world champion of course in

1:01:46.130,1:01:54.560
Rome in 2009 at 15 and it's been one

1:01:49.609,1:01:55.040
long marathon of expectation but he's

1:01:54.560,1:01:57.470
getting there

1:01:55.040,1:02:02.320
and the high 70s is what he has achieved

1:01:57.470,1:02:06.230
so improvement will help aundrea

1:02:02.320,1:02:09.290
Cherubini from italy arm stand back

1:02:06.230,1:02:11.740
triple somersault for the 17 year old

1:02:09.290,1:02:11.740
from Rome

1:02:18.130,1:02:23.920
what I didn't want to hold it too long

1:02:20.060,1:02:27.100
he was ready well that's an entry that

1:02:23.920,1:02:36.910
true bow would be plead pleased with it

1:02:27.100,1:02:36.910
barely a ripple pulled it in nicely

1:02:37.300,1:02:41.720
judges not too impressed I just wonder

1:02:39.770,1:02:43.580
whether he wasn't in that controlled

1:02:41.720,1:02:44.750
handstand position for long enough for

1:02:43.580,1:02:47.570
the judges to be happy

1:02:44.750,1:02:51.470
bit too anxious to get on with it

1:02:47.570,1:02:56.690
basically must give the impression of

1:02:51.470,1:02:58.880
control and time they have to have

1:02:56.690,1:03:02.680
control it's just not going to happen

1:02:58.880,1:03:05.060
otherwise we'll go Parisi from Brazil

1:03:02.680,1:03:07.970
gives you a sense of how far up it is

1:03:05.060,1:03:10.250
doesn't at that low angle in with three

1:03:07.970,1:03:13.400
and a half somersaulting never got

1:03:10.250,1:03:17.930
beyond the preliminary round in two

1:03:13.400,1:03:20.350
Olympic Games before a little bit heavy

1:03:17.930,1:03:20.350
perhaps

1:03:22.380,1:03:31.470
and the one diver left in this second

1:03:27.330,1:03:34.590
series and is an Englishman big splash

1:03:31.470,1:03:44.730
there doesn't help but you go Parisi

1:03:34.590,1:03:46.970
scores spots the ward up it's not quite

1:03:44.730,1:03:46.970
there

1:03:47.150,1:03:53.520
again the crowd are willing on the final

1:03:51.300,1:03:55.820
diver of 32 Peter Waterfield from Great

1:03:53.520,1:03:58.200
Britain who's had his injury problems

1:03:55.820,1:04:00.150
with a virus before the last World

1:03:58.200,1:04:04.620
Championships he's had shoulder injuries

1:04:00.150,1:04:06.720
a neck injury more recently but the 31

1:04:04.620,1:04:08.610
year old is still here and competing and

1:04:06.720,1:04:13.680
ready to do an inward three and a half

1:04:08.610,1:04:17.430
somersault well the crowd reaction told

1:04:13.680,1:04:19.650
you most things about the entry well he

1:04:17.430,1:04:23.340
only had a 66 with his first time and

1:04:19.650,1:04:25.800
needed improvement not a problem and the

1:04:23.340,1:04:31.290
problem is what his head here as the

1:04:25.800,1:04:38.120
legs go way over he's just got through

1:04:31.290,1:04:38.120
it too quickly it's over rotated

1:04:40.059,1:04:47.099
but a silver in Athens in 2004 with Leon

1:04:43.989,1:04:49.930
Taylor and the 10-meter synchronized I

1:04:47.099,1:04:51.579
was nearly at the bottom of the field

1:04:49.930,1:04:55.180
with that second dive unfortunately for

1:04:51.579,1:04:55.930
water-filled at 31st so there is a big

1:04:55.180,1:04:59.439
mountain to climb

1:04:55.930,1:05:01.509
Kubo ascending to his a customary

1:04:59.439,1:05:04.839
position there at the league lib

1:05:01.509,1:05:07.239
galperin german sanchez sasha klein even

1:05:04.839,1:05:11.829
Navarro the Mexicans continuing to do

1:05:07.239,1:05:14.650
well David Boudia has pulled up a little

1:05:11.829,1:05:16.839
bit as well Tom Daley up to 15th he

1:05:14.650,1:05:19.089
might have to come out of the pack as it

1:05:16.839,1:05:22.569
were to try to get into a good position

1:05:19.089,1:05:25.180
rather like running a 10k out there on

1:05:22.569,1:05:27.279
the track not too far away where you get

1:05:25.180,1:05:29.829
through those qualifying rounds in shape

1:05:27.279,1:05:33.699
and look to build that's certainly what

1:05:29.829,1:05:35.949
the crowd in this fantastic 17,000

1:05:33.699,1:05:38.079
seater Aquatic Centre will be hoping

1:05:35.949,1:05:40.239
down there on that caption these are the

1:05:38.079,1:05:41.799
ones who are really are just wanting to

1:05:40.239,1:05:44.469
be back here in the morning and to make

1:05:41.799,1:05:46.390
their olympic games more than a six dive

1:05:44.469,1:05:48.579
wonder Peter Waterfield there the other

1:05:46.390,1:05:50.979
home favorite with a huge amount of work

1:05:48.579,1:05:53.469
to do Matthew Mitchum also on the bubble

1:05:50.979,1:05:55.269
sitting in the 16th position so he can't

1:05:53.469,1:05:56.019
afford to have things go wrong but

1:05:55.269,1:05:58.749
clipped galperin

1:05:56.019,1:06:00.189
it's made a very good start - excellent

1:05:58.749,1:06:03.969
dives that would probably be the worst

1:06:00.189,1:06:05.829
of his three galperin was first after

1:06:03.969,1:06:07.779
the first rotation second after the

1:06:05.829,1:06:11.199
second forward three and a half

1:06:07.779,1:06:15.929
somersault there for the Olympic Games

1:06:11.199,1:06:15.929
bronze medalist in Beijing

1:06:20.329,1:06:29.329
you'd make the syncro team just a 66 for

1:06:25.969,1:06:33.739
his third drive that's disappointing one

1:06:29.329,1:06:36.829
for alprin interestingly enough neither

1:06:33.739,1:06:38.839
of China's gold medal-winning 10 metre

1:06:36.829,1:06:40.459
synchro team actually made the

1:06:38.839,1:06:41.419
individual competition which is just

1:06:40.459,1:06:46.909
astonishing

1:06:41.419,1:06:48.609
lynnie way oh goodness me back there and

1:06:46.909,1:06:50.779
a half somersault there and he's

1:06:48.609,1:06:52.609
starting to show his pedigree I think

1:06:50.779,1:06:55.989
and now we're seeing why they come to

1:06:52.609,1:06:55.989
this event as favourites

1:06:57.850,1:07:05.680
what a position he adopts what an entry

1:07:00.730,1:07:08.080
he achieves and what splash slicing into

1:07:05.680,1:07:12.400
the water there look how tight he is

1:07:08.080,1:07:18.040
there really hugging those legs enormous

1:07:12.400,1:07:19.660
flexibility don't just slim look at the

1:07:18.040,1:07:22.210
power and the muscle definition on his

1:07:19.660,1:07:24.670
thighs and the push-up and the the

1:07:22.210,1:07:29.340
stomach muscle strength to pull out of

1:07:24.670,1:07:29.340
those dives there's a 100 point dive

1:07:33.060,1:07:43.630
Victor Ortega from Colombia previously

1:07:39.850,1:07:46.600
competed at the Olympics in the synchro

1:07:43.630,1:07:49.080
event arm stand back triple somersault

1:07:46.600,1:07:49.080
tucked

1:07:49.330,1:07:57.670
you know respectable 25th after the

1:07:53.710,1:07:59.880
second dive so he's fighting to be back

1:07:57.670,1:08:04.320
tomorrow morning

1:07:59.880,1:08:04.320
nice didn't really control the entry

1:08:07.800,1:08:14.630
it's got three more dives consolidate

1:08:12.300,1:08:14.630
his position

1:08:19.940,1:08:26.279
Anton zakharov just missed out in a

1:08:24.089,1:08:28.520
synchro medal back in 2004 at the

1:08:26.279,1:08:31.290
Olympic Games

1:08:28.520,1:08:35.040
while those high-speed forward four and

1:08:31.290,1:08:38.670
a half somersaults tucked with a 3.7

1:08:35.040,1:08:40.259
tariff if you nail it well it always

1:08:38.670,1:08:42.180
looked like he did have it in control

1:08:40.259,1:08:45.240
not to horizontal with his takeoff from

1:08:42.180,1:08:50.250
the platform their ankles just slightly

1:08:45.240,1:08:52.170
apart made a good job of the entry some

1:08:50.250,1:08:55.680
from column a some from column B as we

1:08:52.170,1:09:00.150
separate he's got his little support

1:08:55.680,1:09:02.100
crew here certainly tell the Ukrainians

1:09:00.150,1:09:04.529
and have very distinctive KITT they wear

1:09:02.100,1:09:07.589
spot them a mile off with anything in

1:09:04.529,1:09:09.799
the eighties you'll take and he's had 72

1:09:07.589,1:09:13.589
and 88 and on 83

1:09:09.799,1:09:16.500
Timofey weld a chick he was right down

1:09:13.589,1:09:18.450
in 30th position forward three and a

1:09:16.500,1:09:21.420
half somersaults was the intention there

1:09:18.450,1:09:24.540
he's come up short hasn't he never got

1:09:21.420,1:09:26.790
through it just struggling to reach he's

1:09:24.540,1:09:29.810
best in this competition and might be

1:09:26.790,1:09:29.810
struggling to explain why

1:09:31.719,1:09:38.020
see his head well away from the knees

1:09:34.029,1:09:39.489
compared to our two Chinese stars just a

1:09:38.020,1:09:40.180
different position he can still make

1:09:39.489,1:09:46.540
that work

1:09:40.180,1:09:50.319
but he didn't on that occasion she own

1:09:46.540,1:09:52.120
Jewry we're on that ten meter board from

1:09:50.319,1:09:56.650
the Democratic People's Republic of

1:09:52.120,1:10:00.580
Korea just sixteen years of age on stand

1:09:56.650,1:10:03.670
back triple somersault now how quickly

1:10:00.580,1:10:07.420
will he be into the dive from his whole

1:10:03.670,1:10:12.310
position up very quickly always not got

1:10:07.420,1:10:15.910
it there or we can do it again but there

1:10:12.310,1:10:19.500
is a there's a time on this and more

1:10:15.910,1:10:19.500
than anything else this is a major test

1:10:20.489,1:10:26.949
good luck well he had to hurry that to

1:10:25.570,1:10:29.530
get into the position again and a

1:10:26.949,1:10:31.630
reminder of just how big that part of

1:10:29.530,1:10:32.830
the dive is a test and not just to be

1:10:31.630,1:10:35.920
taken for granted what they're doing

1:10:32.830,1:10:37.239
before they even set off so he had to

1:10:35.920,1:10:41.860
rush it in the end and under some

1:10:37.239,1:10:46.630
pressure he's flopped over over-rotated

1:10:41.860,1:10:49.170
big splash will be a difficult dive to

1:10:46.630,1:10:49.170
come back from

1:10:50.050,1:10:55.360
the feeling of panic when he lose that

1:10:52.900,1:10:57.969
then when it is all about composure at

1:10:55.360,1:11:02.620
the top of that board must be absolutely

1:10:57.969,1:11:07.270
unimaginable so he's really been

1:11:02.620,1:11:09.960
punished there the score of 18 that is

1:11:07.270,1:11:14.290
that's crippling that is that's a waffle

1:11:09.960,1:11:16.930
Jimmy Connor 17-year old Australian in

1:11:14.290,1:11:21.160
with three and a half somersaults back

1:11:16.930,1:11:23.500
in 24th needs to put on a bit of a show

1:11:21.160,1:11:23.830
here if he's going to be back in the

1:11:23.500,1:11:25.540
morning

1:11:23.830,1:11:30.930
well he could be having a late night

1:11:25.540,1:11:30.930
tonight not at 17

1:11:41.889,1:11:51.070
taking a long time to get said well I

1:11:48.670,1:11:53.290
was concerned for him because he seemed

1:11:51.070,1:11:54.310
to be there an age convincing himself

1:11:53.290,1:11:58.000
when to go

1:11:54.310,1:11:59.980
and yet he's done a good job here it

1:11:58.000,1:12:01.960
must be almost like getting the yips you

1:11:59.980,1:12:05.850
know had golfers and even they call it

1:12:01.960,1:12:05.850
dart itis in darts when you can't let go

1:12:08.580,1:12:15.190
he's got it right in the end

1:12:10.750,1:12:16.690
well played there's some concession to

1:12:15.190,1:12:23.050
his youth you one of the younger divers

1:12:16.690,1:12:24.670
at 17 at a seventy six point eight so

1:12:23.050,1:12:27.090
one in the mid-60s and two in the high

1:12:24.670,1:12:32.860
70s he's hanging around there

1:12:27.090,1:12:34.600
Martin Wolfram from Germany he was here

1:12:32.860,1:12:37.480
in February in the World Cup finished

1:12:34.600,1:12:42.280
ninth at this height reversed three and

1:12:37.480,1:12:47.080
a half somersault oh good job and he was

1:12:42.280,1:12:51.159
19th after the second dive so me too is

1:12:47.080,1:12:54.340
right on that cut and just needed to be

1:12:51.159,1:12:58.480
as good as it turned out to be this is a

1:12:54.340,1:13:00.219
wonderful entry Martin Wolfram and has

1:12:58.480,1:13:02.400
really surged up the standings with this

1:13:00.219,1:13:02.400
one

1:13:08.480,1:13:12.380
not sure how much of that lack of a

1:13:10.610,1:13:14.030
square position the judges will see they

1:13:12.380,1:13:16.340
haven't punished him forward really with

1:13:14.030,1:13:20.600
an 87 45 some nines in the Earth's

1:13:16.340,1:13:23.510
that's a great effort yang Claire Aquila

1:13:20.600,1:13:24.550
from Cuba back three and a half

1:13:23.510,1:13:30.050
somersault

1:13:24.550,1:13:32.719
he's down 20 second position so it's

1:13:30.050,1:13:34.730
within range the difficulty here is

1:13:32.719,1:13:46.160
three point six for the back three and a

1:13:34.730,1:13:48.080
half somersault well didn't quite get

1:13:46.160,1:13:49.940
there and this was his highest tariff

1:13:48.080,1:13:51.969
dive or he's got another one coming for

1:13:49.940,1:13:54.949
his last that's also three point six

1:13:51.969,1:13:58.250
these are the ones you really need to

1:13:54.949,1:13:59.510
make most use of he got to the

1:13:58.250,1:14:01.390
semi-final in last year's World

1:13:59.510,1:14:04.330
Championship so he would have probably

1:14:01.390,1:14:08.920
come to London expecting at least to

1:14:04.330,1:14:08.920
come back for a second round of dives

1:14:09.130,1:14:16.250
but this is the world's best it's going

1:14:11.929,1:14:19.660
to be difficult big splash on injury

1:14:16.250,1:14:23.290
there four and a sixty four point eight

1:14:19.660,1:14:23.290
that won't help him

1:14:24.489,1:14:31.940
Ukrainian Alexander Banda 18 year old

1:14:28.670,1:14:35.090
from Lugansk with a stand back double

1:14:31.940,1:14:37.489
somersault two and a half twists and

1:14:35.090,1:14:44.679
he's up in sixth place needs to just get

1:14:37.489,1:14:44.679
that arm stand straight he's there

1:14:47.880,1:14:51.270
it's to live

1:14:54.199,1:15:02.539
no it has to take something out of the

1:14:59.420,1:15:07.309
shoulders being in that position that

1:15:02.539,1:15:08.869
long seem to be almost too keen to get

1:15:07.309,1:15:10.249
into the twist before he'd really got

1:15:08.869,1:15:12.289
himself away from the board

1:15:10.249,1:15:14.570
yeah and he was bent at the hips bad

1:15:12.289,1:15:17.479
position entering the water the ankles

1:15:14.570,1:15:21.889
came apart also so there was some leg

1:15:17.479,1:15:23.479
form issues throughout the dive only

1:15:21.889,1:15:25.760
came together at the end but the the

1:15:23.479,1:15:28.280
entry was not too special so a fifty

1:15:25.760,1:15:33.709
seventy six and vonda is gonna plummet

1:15:28.280,1:15:37.269
down the rankings when all said and done

1:15:33.709,1:15:41.979
after the third consistency that's the

1:15:37.269,1:15:47.079
the big test across six dives

1:15:41.979,1:15:51.130
Jihu Park from Korea twenty-year-old

1:15:47.079,1:15:51.130
back three and a half somersault

1:15:51.460,1:15:59.500
and has ever done that one as well he

1:15:55.360,1:16:04.600
he's struggling really Park not his

1:15:59.500,1:16:07.720
night must be so hard to put the

1:16:04.600,1:16:09.520
previous dive behind you and and start

1:16:07.720,1:16:12.010
from scratch every time it's a bit like

1:16:09.520,1:16:13.840
a bit like a golfer stepping up on the

1:16:12.010,1:16:16.720
tee again after a double bogey and

1:16:13.840,1:16:18.430
needing to clear all the negatives out

1:16:16.720,1:16:20.530
and starting again with each dive he

1:16:18.430,1:16:22.630
just never got into a really tight tuck

1:16:20.530,1:16:24.550
position even the split tuck would have

1:16:22.630,1:16:27.460
helped him get through those rotations

1:16:24.550,1:16:30.090
more quickly so some technique issues

1:16:27.460,1:16:30.090
there for Park

1:16:31.980,1:16:42.870
Victoire mini bive synchro partner of

1:16:39.850,1:16:42.870
idiot Zack it off

1:16:47.399,1:16:53.070
reverse three and a half somersault

1:16:49.449,1:16:53.070
another long wait at the top there

1:16:56.490,1:17:01.630
well very nice 11th after two dives I

1:17:00.040,1:17:05.350
don't think he's gonna give up any

1:17:01.630,1:17:07.090
ground with that one you know half an

1:17:05.350,1:17:08.590
arm movement at the top there we looked

1:17:07.090,1:17:14.920
as though he wasn't quite sure and then

1:17:08.590,1:17:16.930
he was all very positive judges are

1:17:14.920,1:17:20.440
fairly happy with it the the feet just

1:17:16.930,1:17:27.610
rolled over at the very end but very

1:17:20.440,1:17:31.180
positive entry after a rough start a 67

1:17:27.610,1:17:36.280
with his first dive 86 9 5 his second

1:17:31.180,1:17:37.650
and then 82.5 for his third so starting

1:17:36.280,1:17:41.230
to produce it

1:17:37.650,1:17:43.450
next up it's 20 year old German Sanchez

1:17:41.230,1:17:46.060
from Guadalajara in Mexico who's having

1:17:43.450,1:17:49.690
an excellent games silver medal from the

1:17:46.060,1:17:52.360
synchro already in his kit and third

1:17:49.690,1:17:56.140
after two dives and now with an arm

1:17:52.360,1:17:57.730
stand back triple somersault how long

1:17:56.140,1:18:03.900
will it take him to get into that key

1:17:57.730,1:18:03.900
position legs wide in closing

1:18:08.930,1:18:12.960
well he looked more confident that at

1:18:11.490,1:18:19.560
the top than he did at the bottom where

1:18:12.960,1:18:21.150
the entry was less than ideal he's got a

1:18:19.560,1:18:28.100
little bit of room to play with having

1:18:21.150,1:18:28.100
come into this series well-positioned

1:18:31.400,1:18:39.120
former Cunha world silver medalist at 10

1:18:34.590,1:18:41.870
meters that was only in 2010 so they are

1:18:39.120,1:18:45.000
so young these competitors many of them

1:18:41.870,1:18:46.110
follows a professional footballer so you

1:18:45.000,1:18:49.470
should know a little bit about diving

1:18:46.110,1:18:52.020
there's one or two footballers a little

1:18:49.470,1:18:53.160
bit that's unkind but it's well worked

1:18:52.020,1:18:56.010
in there nice segue

1:18:53.160,1:18:58.070
seventy seventy five point nine for his

1:18:56.010,1:19:06.030
third as we move under Riley McCormick

1:18:58.070,1:19:16.670
from Canada kings in with

1:19:06.030,1:19:19.560
three-and-a-half somersault lovely at

1:19:16.670,1:19:26.850
McCormick they'll be proud of that one I

1:19:19.560,1:19:31.770
think especially the entry this is a

1:19:26.850,1:19:33.930
zero splash dive if you like just pulls

1:19:31.770,1:19:37.080
that water down with him the air that

1:19:33.930,1:19:39.030
he's created the arms separate it's a

1:19:37.080,1:19:42.120
bit of a technique to this to ripping

1:19:39.030,1:19:43.500
the entry and give him nine out of ten

1:19:42.120,1:19:45.750
for the entry not that they separate

1:19:43.500,1:19:49.710
them but you know sitting up here

1:19:45.750,1:19:52.130
weekend and an 80 from Arizona State

1:19:49.710,1:19:56.280
University combining his diving with his

1:19:52.130,1:19:59.520
studies in the United States he wants

1:19:56.280,1:20:01.350
our job career in broadcasting Matthew

1:19:59.520,1:20:03.240
Mitchum I think he needs to make a

1:20:01.350,1:20:04.950
statement now amateur manie's he's just

1:20:03.240,1:20:08.070
had a pedestrian couple of first two

1:20:04.950,1:20:12.500
dives him with three and a half

1:20:08.070,1:20:12.500
somersault for the defending champion

1:20:13.150,1:20:18.650
that's better well the evidence shows

1:20:17.240,1:20:23.150
that he knows how to pull out the big

1:20:18.650,1:20:24.650
one on the big occasion but he has left

1:20:23.150,1:20:29.900
himself a little bit more work than he

1:20:24.650,1:20:32.540
would have expected very good entry and

1:20:29.900,1:20:34.700
he's going to pull some eights and a

1:20:32.540,1:20:38.410
very split tuck position but then pulls

1:20:34.700,1:20:38.410
it back together again for the entry

1:20:38.890,1:20:44.300
competed in the 3-meter springboard at

1:20:41.240,1:20:47.570
the last Olympics didn't qualify for the

1:20:44.300,1:20:49.940
final but now concentrating and it's got

1:20:47.570,1:20:51.350
a mark in the 80s - let's move him up

1:20:49.940,1:20:55.760
the rankings we'll see when everyone's

1:20:51.350,1:20:59.990
finished three armand gives Mavic from

1:20:55.760,1:21:03.250
norway back three and a half somersault

1:20:59.990,1:21:03.250
he's 12

1:21:10.180,1:21:15.610
competed it to one meter and the world

1:21:13.330,1:21:19.630
championships one meter of course not an

1:21:15.610,1:21:21.670
Olympic event his problem there was that

1:21:19.630,1:21:24.610
even in the tuck position his feet

1:21:21.670,1:21:25.810
weren't aligned and the judges Sidon

1:21:24.610,1:21:28.540
would have been able to see that as

1:21:25.810,1:21:31.350
perhaps you did too that's an unusual

1:21:28.540,1:21:31.350
error really

1:21:34.120,1:21:45.490
in the 6435 for his mervich looks to be

1:21:42.700,1:21:46.870
good camaraderie around the pool we love

1:21:45.490,1:21:48.970
seeing that at the Olympics even at the

1:21:46.870,1:21:52.330
very top level at the athletes my

1:21:48.970,1:21:53.830
friends we've seen plenty of that in all

1:21:52.330,1:21:57.160
the sports across the games which has

1:21:53.830,1:21:59.530
been great Francesco del mo because it's

1:21:57.160,1:22:02.050
a long Lee a lonely place rather at the

1:21:59.530,1:22:08.860
top of that board in with three and a

1:22:02.050,1:22:10.690
half somersault very good Francesco come

1:22:08.860,1:22:11.920
up smiling he sometimes get a sense of

1:22:10.690,1:22:13.330
how the diver feels about and how

1:22:11.920,1:22:14.770
quickly they come to the surface well

1:22:13.330,1:22:16.270
here's some of this applause I thought

1:22:14.770,1:22:21.370
that went alright what's the crowd thing

1:22:16.270,1:22:25.570
well they liked it he was a European

1:22:21.370,1:22:29.170
silver medalist back in 2004 so he's had

1:22:25.570,1:22:34.980
a good length career to know how to deal

1:22:29.170,1:22:34.980
with these occasions eighty one six

1:22:37.290,1:22:46.240
Christopher s Kilson from Sweden who's

1:22:42.180,1:22:48.790
doing too badly 12th equal after three

1:22:46.240,1:22:51.360
dives and now an arm stand back triple

1:22:48.790,1:22:51.360
somersault

1:22:56.170,1:23:00.429
while he executed the dive okay but he

1:22:58.780,1:23:04.390
didn't look convincing in the handstand

1:23:00.429,1:23:06.070
he once he reached a position where he

1:23:04.390,1:23:08.699
felt confident he did move but he hadn't

1:23:06.070,1:23:08.699
held it for long

1:23:11.500,1:23:15.489
judges aren't too unhappy with him he

1:23:13.510,1:23:20.100
was pretty vertical for the entry even

1:23:15.489,1:23:20.100
if it wasn't a low splash affair

1:23:25.900,1:23:32.890
and a seventy two point six

1:23:30.370,1:23:34.360
these boys that are sort of on the

1:23:32.890,1:23:35.320
bubble that brings its own pressure when

1:23:34.360,1:23:37.230
you get about halfway through the

1:23:35.320,1:23:40.260
competition you realize that you can't

1:23:37.230,1:23:42.790
muck up a dive

1:23:40.260,1:23:45.730
Eric Sain said it was a dream come true

1:23:42.790,1:23:47.200
just to be at the Olympics and admitted

1:23:45.730,1:23:49.240
that he'd said his stall out to get to

1:23:47.200,1:23:52.150
the final was his ambition but he's got

1:23:49.240,1:23:54.190
some work to do I'm staying back double

1:23:52.150,1:24:00.880
somersault two and a half twist he's

1:23:54.190,1:24:02.860
back in 29th oh dear that was short he

1:24:00.880,1:24:05.500
almost fell off the platform he's had a

1:24:02.860,1:24:08.590
couple of poor dives only three

1:24:05.500,1:24:10.000
competitors below him and this wonder

1:24:08.590,1:24:15.250
what's going on here for Eric he's a

1:24:10.000,1:24:17.890
better driver than this well you'll look

1:24:15.250,1:24:19.330
at that as I'm sure he will and realize

1:24:17.890,1:24:23.140
that he can do better

1:24:19.330,1:24:26.530
Canadian champion at the individual and

1:24:23.140,1:24:29.950
the synchro events picked up medals

1:24:26.530,1:24:33.070
pan-american games Commonwealth Games

1:24:29.950,1:24:37.780
but this is a big step up in the Olympic

1:24:33.070,1:24:44.800
Games and 55.8 for Eric he's going to be

1:24:37.780,1:24:50.080
disheartened by that Brian Lomas from

1:24:44.800,1:24:52.480
Malaysia trains in China with facilities

1:24:50.080,1:24:55.540
you won't be surprised to discover our

1:24:52.480,1:24:56.170
top quality back three and a half

1:24:55.540,1:25:03.370
somersault

1:24:56.170,1:25:07.990
oh well that's seriously overcooking it

1:25:03.370,1:25:12.070
a fairly straightforward dive it's a

1:25:07.990,1:25:14.080
shame for him the crowd reaction told

1:25:12.070,1:25:16.270
you everything there let alone what the

1:25:14.080,1:25:19.950
judges would make of it just tumbling

1:25:16.270,1:25:19.950
into it like a chimney being demolished

1:25:20.520,1:25:26.770
yeah that's a 29.7 such a low score that

1:25:25.180,1:25:30.820
it could be hard to recover from with

1:25:26.770,1:25:33.550
three dives to come and he too is better

1:25:30.820,1:25:36.700
than that if you look at his past record

1:25:33.550,1:25:40.870
now the Mexicans are on a bit of a

1:25:36.700,1:25:47.910
charge in this diving competition even

1:25:40.870,1:25:53.560
Garcia v the synchro silver medallist

1:25:47.910,1:25:56.260
Pan American double champion seventh of

1:25:53.560,1:25:58.380
the world's last year this is

1:25:56.260,1:26:03.220
competition that he's familiar with

1:25:58.380,1:26:05.950
standard he can match still only 18 so

1:26:03.220,1:26:07.150
he is obviously progressing in his

1:26:05.950,1:26:10.390
career the inward four and a half

1:26:07.150,1:26:13.890
somersault tucked four point one the

1:26:10.390,1:26:13.890
tariff here a big one

1:26:19.910,1:26:26.820
well okay when you've got that big

1:26:25.290,1:26:28.380
tariff you really are looking to play

1:26:26.820,1:26:30.840
your Joker as they say and get the

1:26:28.380,1:26:32.910
almost the double points let's look for

1:26:30.840,1:26:36.350
the problems he had by the time he

1:26:32.910,1:26:38.730
reached the water here that the legs

1:26:36.350,1:26:41.700
weren't where he wanted them to be they

1:26:38.730,1:26:44.210
were they weren't straight from the hips

1:26:41.700,1:26:47.960
and they weren't together at the ankles

1:26:44.210,1:26:51.620
and the judges will get him for that

1:26:47.960,1:26:51.620
just a slight twist

1:26:52.080,1:26:56.020
seventy seven point nine now and the the

1:26:54.580,1:27:02.800
difficulty certainly helps boost the

1:26:56.020,1:27:06.760
score on to Nick McCrory from Durham

1:27:02.800,1:27:08.620
North Carolina studying maths at Duke

1:27:06.760,1:27:10.060
University so he'll be able to work out

1:27:08.620,1:27:11.950
his own scores quick and the judges

1:27:10.060,1:27:15.550
perhaps or do have a little bit of

1:27:11.950,1:27:19.590
computer aid be quick forward four and a

1:27:15.550,1:27:21.850
half somersault worth three point seven

1:27:19.590,1:27:25.150
different ways to take the photo these

1:27:21.850,1:27:27.220
days they hit the tablet out and just

1:27:25.150,1:27:29.670
watch the entry here he made a good job

1:27:27.220,1:27:32.050
with the zero almost zero splash but

1:27:29.670,1:27:35.400
flies to a vertical position that

1:27:32.050,1:27:37.660
certainly helped but I think the judges

1:27:35.400,1:27:40.470
would see that he hadn't achieved a

1:27:37.660,1:27:40.470
vertical position

1:27:48.210,1:27:59.170
Koza Guerra from Cuba bringing up the

1:27:55.659,1:28:00.760
rear at the moment it's worth pausing to

1:27:59.170,1:28:02.560
look at that great score that linear

1:28:00.760,1:28:04.659
he's now fifteen points clear of the

1:28:02.560,1:28:08.170
field we haven't finished this third

1:28:04.659,1:28:12.760
series but hundred points will help you

1:28:08.170,1:28:19.949
every time all very nice

1:28:12.760,1:28:21.909
Oh Jose Guerra oh please the Cubans

1:28:19.949,1:28:25.090
we've got a silver at the World

1:28:21.909,1:28:28.690
Championships at 10 meters back in 2005

1:28:25.090,1:28:30.760
so suddenly finding rats Allah form well

1:28:28.690,1:28:32.530
he was nowhere uh after the second

1:28:30.760,1:28:35.349
series he had a disastrous second dive

1:28:32.530,1:28:39.790
he's put that well out of his mind to

1:28:35.349,1:28:42.130
produce a stellar effort maybe a bit of

1:28:39.790,1:28:43.900
encouragement there not just for Jose

1:28:42.130,1:28:45.340
but also for every other diver who's

1:28:43.900,1:28:48.099
starting to think that he might have

1:28:45.340,1:28:50.320
missed the boat that was brilliant as a

1:28:48.099,1:28:57.520
city it's his fourth Olympic Games he

1:28:50.320,1:28:59.520
has got diving pedigree that's live and

1:28:57.520,1:29:05.400
they crown up as well

1:28:59.520,1:29:07.780
Sebastian via now he's seventeenth

1:29:05.400,1:29:09.790
cannot afford to drop his standards with

1:29:07.780,1:29:14.020
an arm stand back triple somersault all

1:29:09.790,1:29:16.300
but he has and that's well short of the

1:29:14.020,1:29:21.670
vertical scanning back through Guerra's

1:29:16.300,1:29:26.699
dives at 3:58 2192 a model of

1:29:21.670,1:29:26.699
inconsistency proves he's a fighter

1:29:29.639,1:29:39.179
well that's a shame just an ADA it's the

1:29:35.199,1:29:41.250
best in be agony for the coaches and the

1:29:39.179,1:29:45.840
family and everybody else here

1:29:41.250,1:29:48.000
supporting fair old tricks from Colombia

1:29:45.840,1:29:51.610
David Boudia

1:29:48.000,1:29:53.300
tense so far not as far as it is from

1:29:51.610,1:30:01.610
Australia Roger

1:29:53.300,1:30:04.520
very true very true very nice it was

1:30:01.610,1:30:06.860
like a second splash if you will he

1:30:04.520,1:30:09.860
didn't quite control the air under the

1:30:06.860,1:30:15.860
water there it was a funny one those

1:30:09.860,1:30:17.630
four and a half somersaults tucked there

1:30:15.860,1:30:20.060
was a lot of tumbling momentum to try

1:30:17.630,1:30:26.120
and bring under control at the end for

1:30:20.060,1:30:28.810
the entry they're pulling him forward

1:30:26.120,1:30:31.100
it's the best American platform diver

1:30:28.810,1:30:34.940
among the men since the great Greg

1:30:31.100,1:30:38.120
Louganis one of the iconic names from

1:30:34.940,1:30:39.680
diving in the past when America

1:30:38.120,1:30:41.990
absolutely dominated at this event

1:30:39.680,1:30:44.300
before China decided to enter and

1:30:41.990,1:30:45.830
spoiled their party a little bit well he

1:30:44.300,1:30:48.040
inspired many to take up the sport

1:30:45.830,1:30:50.570
didn't he's such a master of it

1:30:48.040,1:30:52.640
springboard and platform and that famous

1:30:50.570,1:30:56.410
crack on the board which we do not want

1:30:52.640,1:30:59.420
to see repeated to bow now the star oh

1:30:56.410,1:31:02.410
and again he sets a very high standard

1:30:59.420,1:31:05.660
nice and tidy into the platform

1:31:02.410,1:31:08.420
the crowd is being treated here there's

1:31:05.660,1:31:12.020
some world-class diving particularly

1:31:08.420,1:31:13.970
from the two Chinese just 19 years of

1:31:12.020,1:31:18.590
age he's the son of a factory worker

1:31:13.970,1:31:20.090
from C chuan uncle was a gymnast and the

1:31:18.590,1:31:23.630
big marks are coming out for the big

1:31:20.090,1:31:25.520
dives now throw out the two nines and

1:31:23.630,1:31:34.010
the ten and you just left with nine and

1:31:25.520,1:31:39.560
a half's butcher boat and a 90 405 and

1:31:34.010,1:31:42.950
now he leads linear China one two no

1:31:39.560,1:31:45.770
shock there Sascha Klein though wanting

1:31:42.950,1:31:48.050
to make the statement in this

1:31:45.770,1:31:50.540
preliminary round that he is a genuine

1:31:48.050,1:31:52.640
medal contender we'll worry about the

1:31:50.540,1:31:55.370
color of that medal afterwards an arm

1:31:52.640,1:32:00.670
stand back triple somersault were three

1:31:55.370,1:32:00.670
point five for the German diver

1:32:02.440,1:32:07.130
excellent job good effort with that one

1:32:04.610,1:32:08.570
Sascha Klein he's not gonna give up too

1:32:07.130,1:32:11.540
much ground without I would he wouldn't

1:32:08.570,1:32:16.070
think having come into his third dive in

1:32:11.540,1:32:18.800
fourth position he's a soldier serves in

1:32:16.070,1:32:20.450
the army who obviously are very

1:32:18.800,1:32:28.250
accommodating and give him plenty of

1:32:20.450,1:32:30.860
training time I would imagine looks

1:32:28.250,1:32:35.960
happy with it and a 9275 why wouldn't

1:32:30.860,1:32:38.540
you be Maxie's best dive sofa 81 88 and

1:32:35.960,1:32:40.580
92 I think you might be on the bookies

1:32:38.540,1:32:43.610
blackboard that one I think that special

1:32:40.580,1:32:44.450
client could be somebody who is in

1:32:43.610,1:32:46.190
contention

1:32:44.450,1:32:49.220
although the way the Chinese are

1:32:46.190,1:32:51.530
starting to emerge that will have just

1:32:49.220,1:32:58.550
to be all competing for third place I'd

1:32:51.530,1:33:00.350
even capped off now I'd look to be

1:32:58.550,1:33:01.910
struggling in his departure from the

1:33:00.350,1:33:04.760
platform but he knew what he was doing

1:33:01.910,1:33:08.740
got through it forward double somersault

1:33:04.760,1:33:08.740
with a twist after that arm stand

1:33:10.570,1:33:16.270
not even allowed to enjoy his dive again

1:33:14.710,1:33:22.120
and wait for the scores because you know

1:33:16.270,1:33:25.300
who is on next it's got two mates in

1:33:22.120,1:33:29.950
there though but him kept or or a score

1:33:25.300,1:33:33.280
of 74 for and 16th this needs to keep

1:33:29.950,1:33:35.560
impressing Tom Daly who was given the

1:33:33.280,1:33:39.730
honor of making the first dive in this

1:33:35.560,1:33:42.490
pool when it was officially opened July

1:33:39.730,1:33:44.770
last year with exactly one day one year

1:33:42.490,1:33:47.980
to go to the day to the opening of the

1:33:44.770,1:33:53.650
games arm stand back triple somersault

1:33:47.980,1:33:56.500
he's back in 15th remaining you 18 to

1:33:53.650,1:33:59.700
move on to the semi so it's gonna keep

1:33:56.500,1:33:59.700
some good dives coming

1:34:07.070,1:34:11.269
he's recovered that well he had a moment

1:34:09.449,1:34:15.650
of unsteadiness in the handstand

1:34:11.269,1:34:18.150
collected himself and executed well

1:34:15.650,1:34:19.469
crowds absolutely loved him he's had

1:34:18.150,1:34:21.869
problems as a youngster

1:34:19.469,1:34:24.210
obviously the terribly sad story of his

1:34:21.869,1:34:26.130
father dying he was such a an influence

1:34:24.210,1:34:29.539
obviously in a massive active supporter

1:34:26.130,1:34:34.050
he was bullied at school for a while and

1:34:29.539,1:34:37.800
such a nice chap as well he's such a

1:34:34.050,1:34:41.730
nice dive in there and I think an eighty

1:34:37.800,1:34:44.309
nine to five and Tom Daly starting to

1:34:41.730,1:34:46.610
find the confidence needed to just move

1:34:44.309,1:34:48.690
on to the next part of the competition

1:34:46.610,1:34:50.309
doing a bit of a gesture nice they're

1:34:48.690,1:34:51.929
just withdrawing into himself and

1:34:50.309,1:34:54.809
keeping that composure in between dives

1:34:51.929,1:34:57.690
and they pull a long wait I'm doing a

1:34:54.809,1:35:04.079
tiara beany back three and a half

1:34:57.690,1:35:06.090
somersault he's way down in 28th he

1:35:04.079,1:35:07.800
still might be down there too after over

1:35:06.090,1:35:12.539
rotating there and making a bit of a

1:35:07.800,1:35:14.309
mess at the entry at 17 these teenage

1:35:12.539,1:35:18.329
divers have a lot of chance to come

1:35:14.309,1:35:19.769
again and continue to progress I think

1:35:18.329,1:35:21.179
you have to taste this level of

1:35:19.769,1:35:23.849
competition and the pressure that comes

1:35:21.179,1:35:25.710
with it to deal with it and then make

1:35:23.849,1:35:27.269
the most of it next time it's it's a

1:35:25.710,1:35:33.349
rear Olympian who steps up the first

1:35:27.269,1:35:35.249
time and nails it especially at that age

1:35:33.349,1:35:36.869
you're used to seeing that with the

1:35:35.249,1:35:39.030
gymnastics where also they start

1:35:36.869,1:35:41.130
fronting Lee Jung know they do but not

1:35:39.030,1:35:44.369
as young as they used to they've made a

1:35:41.130,1:35:46.800
few restrictions to age and the women

1:35:44.369,1:35:53.690
have to be turning 16 the year of the

1:35:46.800,1:35:53.690
Olympic competition Parisi from Brazil

1:35:54.380,1:36:00.290
he's not having the best of days either

1:35:56.489,1:36:00.290
that back three and a half somersault

1:36:02.870,1:36:10.110
and he by contrast

1:36:05.250,1:36:11.940
Hugo is 28 he just never quite got there

1:36:10.110,1:36:14.190
when he had quite an angle and made

1:36:11.940,1:36:16.830
quite a splash but not in a good way

1:36:14.190,1:36:20.630
they've done that dive so many times but

1:36:16.830,1:36:24.659
it's all about delivering it on the day

1:36:20.630,1:36:27.150
Peter Waterfield from Great Britain who

1:36:24.659,1:36:29.940
it's having a very disappointing evening

1:36:27.150,1:36:38.820
so far but the terrific crowd here

1:36:29.940,1:36:43.290
predictably right behind him forward

1:36:38.820,1:36:45.469
four and a half somersault well this is

1:36:43.290,1:36:48.420
his big dive it's the three point seven

1:36:45.469,1:36:50.580
difficulty and he's about to make up but

1:36:48.420,1:36:52.110
a serious amount of ground here the

1:36:50.580,1:36:58.260
crowd doing their best to influence the

1:36:52.110,1:37:01.889
judges he was competing back in 1997 a

1:36:58.260,1:37:04.110
world championship level so he does know

1:37:01.889,1:37:06.600
how to put these things behind him well

1:37:04.110,1:37:08.520
that was a wonderful dive that's a view

1:37:06.600,1:37:12.060
as he goes past the judges has got to

1:37:08.520,1:37:13.620
get those feet together they can't

1:37:12.060,1:37:16.290
afford to blink the judges Ken you know

1:37:13.620,1:37:17.820
it's there's actually two panels worked

1:37:16.290,1:37:19.770
through this long session to make sure

1:37:17.820,1:37:23.310
that the job's done with fresh eyes

1:37:19.770,1:37:24.110
ninety four three five that's well done

1:37:23.310,1:37:27.929
him

1:37:24.110,1:37:29.550
that'll help he looks as though he's

1:37:27.929,1:37:32.280
pleased with that quite rightly so

1:37:29.550,1:37:38.040
showing his fighting qualities let's

1:37:32.280,1:37:39.170
check on that leaderboard then halfway

1:37:38.040,1:37:42.210
through the competition

1:37:39.170,1:37:46.020
Qubo leading from the front but Sasha

1:37:42.210,1:37:50.520
climbed from Germany up there in second

1:37:46.020,1:37:54.030
place Lynn you a German Sanchez galperin

1:37:50.520,1:37:57.630
the second Mexican even Garcia Tom Daley

1:37:54.030,1:38:00.270
progressing up to ninth and just after

1:37:57.630,1:38:01.739
hear the next caption will give you

1:38:00.270,1:38:03.840
where the cut is these are the people

1:38:01.739,1:38:06.120
who are really under the pressure at the

1:38:03.840,1:38:07.440
moment it's not those at the top it cap

1:38:06.120,1:38:10.170
to a bondage

1:38:07.440,1:38:12.660
Connor Victor Ortega there all around

1:38:10.170,1:38:14.699
that cattle 18 that is their objective

1:38:12.660,1:38:17.070
and it is tight around there

1:38:14.699,1:38:17.850
half a dozen points will make all the

1:38:17.070,1:38:19.920
difference

1:38:17.850,1:38:23.460
see Peter Waterfield made up some ground

1:38:19.920,1:38:25.110
with that third dive but still 17 away

1:38:23.460,1:38:26.850
from that little group on the bubble so

1:38:25.110,1:38:32.460
he has got to have a couple more good

1:38:26.850,1:38:35.989
dives but it can be done I only made

1:38:32.460,1:38:35.989
three or four ahead of you to stumble

1:38:38.989,1:38:43.949
again they're keeping very well tightly

1:38:41.580,1:38:45.719
to schedule here the one of the features

1:38:43.949,1:38:47.840
when you go from event to event not just

1:38:45.719,1:38:50.190
in the diving Paul is the the

1:38:47.840,1:38:53.100
competition organization how quickly

1:38:50.190,1:38:55.949
they get every sport ready and the whole

1:38:53.100,1:38:59.280
thing is like clockwork really to a very

1:38:55.949,1:39:03.780
strict time schedule so back to the top

1:38:59.280,1:39:06.330
of the order we go lib galperin from

1:39:03.780,1:39:10.800
russia double world champion and Olympic

1:39:06.330,1:39:13.710
bronze medalist lovely dive to start the

1:39:10.800,1:39:15.810
fourth and he's never been out of the

1:39:13.710,1:39:18.270
top five in the competition this evening

1:39:15.810,1:39:20.940
and I think he might just stay there

1:39:18.270,1:39:25.050
that was well-executed confidently done

1:39:20.940,1:39:26.850
this man as we've discussed is come back

1:39:25.050,1:39:29.460
from a series of terrible injuries and a

1:39:26.850,1:39:32.280
host of operations and still performing

1:39:29.460,1:39:36.840
at the top comes from a sporting family

1:39:32.280,1:39:38.760
his father works in diving for the

1:39:36.840,1:39:40.620
Russian Ministry of sport and his mother

1:39:38.760,1:39:42.870
there's a master of sport in gymnastics

1:39:40.620,1:39:46.050
so he's got it from both sides there

1:39:42.870,1:39:47.760
plenty of guidance a couple in the 80s

1:39:46.050,1:39:52.160
and 91 and they're just that their dive

1:39:47.760,1:39:56.300
of 66 for Easter but let's enjoy linear

1:39:52.160,1:39:56.300
four and a half somersault

1:39:57.079,1:40:03.989
speed of that well he can certainly

1:40:00.299,1:40:07.439
somersault he didn't quite pull it up in

1:40:03.989,1:40:11.519
quite the right way as flipped over the

1:40:07.439,1:40:14.909
feet here at that split tuck position to

1:40:11.519,1:40:20.129
get through the splash means that he

1:40:14.909,1:40:23.939
won't be getting nines actually broke

1:40:20.129,1:40:27.329
the 600 barrier four points in the 2010

1:40:23.939,1:40:31.079
national championships in China 603

1:40:27.329,1:40:33.239
point four five an astonishing total and

1:40:31.079,1:40:37.019
he's rattling up they are a 92 they're

1:40:33.239,1:40:42.599
there they're just so consistent used to

1:40:37.019,1:40:49.709
average 100 per dive rageous yeah Victor

1:40:42.599,1:40:50.939
Ortega from Colombia xx you was in with

1:40:49.709,1:40:55.639
a shout inward three and a half

1:40:50.939,1:40:55.639
somersault that needs to make progress

1:40:56.269,1:41:00.899
it's planning to be a lawyer when he

1:40:58.649,1:41:05.539
finishes competing and give something

1:41:00.899,1:41:05.539
back to the sport she's lovely to hear

1:41:06.349,1:41:10.010
hope he's not done yet

1:41:10.399,1:41:13.739
interesting the height there off the

1:41:12.299,1:41:16.679
board he got trying to get through those

1:41:13.739,1:41:21.749
somersaults almost before they go back

1:41:16.679,1:41:25.679
down at a lovely position just a

1:41:21.749,1:41:28.039
slightly larger splash and a 73 6-4

1:41:25.679,1:41:28.039
tiger

1:41:31.730,1:41:38.600
went on zakharov had more success at

1:41:35.350,1:41:44.150
synchro competition than when in the

1:41:38.600,1:41:46.550
individual dives reverse four-and-a-half

1:41:44.150,1:41:48.590
somersault it's just a little arched on

1:41:46.550,1:41:52.790
entry there Raji's won't get the full

1:41:48.590,1:41:54.110
value for it it's looking very solid to

1:41:52.790,1:41:58.610
be back again tomorrow morning though

1:41:54.110,1:42:01.970
unless he has a disaster later on fairly

1:41:58.610,1:42:07.100
tight into the platform it's really

1:42:01.970,1:42:09.950
reaching to try and pull that entry he's

1:42:07.100,1:42:13.640
been competing at a world championship

1:42:09.950,1:42:16.910
level since 2001 he's only 26 which

1:42:13.640,1:42:18.620
gives you an idea for the 16 and 17 year

1:42:16.910,1:42:20.720
olds that we're seeing just how their

1:42:18.620,1:42:24.760
career can develop over the long term

1:42:20.720,1:42:24.760
and they could be back for 2-3 Olympics

1:42:26.500,1:42:35.140
Timofey audio check of Belarus in with

1:42:32.300,1:42:37.340
three and a half somersault thirty first

1:42:35.140,1:42:40.210
personal pride perhaps his main

1:42:37.340,1:42:40.210
motivation here

1:42:45.300,1:42:52.920
that's a better one he's had a couple of

1:42:48.040,1:42:52.920
indifferent dives for the air chick

1:42:55.450,1:43:02.990
pride might indeed have motivated him

1:42:58.880,1:43:05.210
here he's just managed to put the poor

1:43:02.990,1:43:08.150
dives to one side come up with a better

1:43:05.210,1:43:10.370
one if not quite the splash he would

1:43:08.150,1:43:11.930
have liked that divers don't see the

1:43:10.370,1:43:16.570
splash but I'm sure they get a sense of

1:43:11.930,1:43:16.570
it and a sixty eight eight for him

1:43:26.860,1:43:37.960
now hyungjoo Democratic People's

1:43:30.820,1:43:39.730
Republic of Korea he's a 16 year old the

1:43:37.960,1:43:43.690
back three-and-a-half somersault this is

1:43:39.730,1:43:48.280
a competition for real experience one

1:43:43.690,1:43:51.370
suspects from Pyongyang he's just

1:43:48.280,1:43:53.890
finding that I can't bring his best

1:43:51.370,1:43:56.560
dives to this I wonder if we will have

1:43:53.890,1:44:00.640
see better from him when another Olympic

1:43:56.560,1:44:05.170
cycle rolls past but that's a very poor

1:44:00.640,1:44:07.630
entry at this level only five foot one

1:44:05.170,1:44:10.600
he must be one of the smallest divers in

1:44:07.630,1:44:18.250
the competition but rather deflating

1:44:10.600,1:44:23.140
marks there now Jimmy Conner the 17 year

1:44:18.250,1:44:26.560
old he's just at 19 I'm standing back

1:44:23.140,1:44:28.750
double somersault one and a half twists

1:44:26.560,1:44:31.560
from Melbourne but he lives in Brisbane

1:44:28.750,1:44:34.780
trains there splits the family up her

1:44:31.560,1:44:40.810
dad lives in Melbourne mum lives with

1:44:34.780,1:44:42.250
him sacrifices that families make all

1:44:40.810,1:44:48.070
sorts of ways to get to the handstand

1:44:42.250,1:44:50.610
and this is James he's there it's the

1:44:48.070,1:44:50.610
important thing

1:44:50.750,1:44:59.730
and he just over-rotated on the entry

1:44:53.970,1:45:01.770
there it's a big strain on a young lad

1:44:59.730,1:45:03.630
not just competing here but as we

1:45:01.770,1:45:06.810
mentioned there you know when the family

1:45:03.630,1:45:09.450
has to split up to back him and the it's

1:45:06.810,1:45:12.270
what city the whole family invests in

1:45:09.450,1:45:13.380
that sporting future is a nice errific

1:45:12.270,1:45:15.989
pressure on a young lad

1:45:13.380,1:45:18.239
yes brisbane some sixteen hundred

1:45:15.989,1:45:21.120
kilometres from melbourne it's it's no

1:45:18.239,1:45:22.590
overnight trip i can tell you to get the

1:45:21.120,1:45:32.160
family back together a sixty-four

1:45:22.590,1:45:36.150
therefore james martin wolfram from

1:45:32.160,1:45:38.250
dresden in germany tenth back

1:45:36.150,1:45:50.660
three-and-a-half somersault having a

1:45:38.250,1:45:50.660
pretty good evening so far nearly

1:45:52.220,1:45:55.320
and see what went wrong here was made me

1:45:54.720,1:45:57.990
again

1:45:55.320,1:46:02.330
the most obvious error and in quite a

1:45:57.990,1:46:04.890
nice position here nose to the knees

1:46:02.330,1:46:08.120
didn't straighten it out in time for an

1:46:04.890,1:46:08.120
impressive entry

1:46:14.639,1:46:19.030
you'd be fairly pleased so far though

1:46:16.869,1:46:21.729
he's sitting comfortably in the frame

1:46:19.030,1:46:24.190
and just has to keep it steady and get

1:46:21.729,1:46:26.139
on with his work really yeah three point

1:46:24.190,1:46:30.719
six difficulty helped him out there to

1:46:26.139,1:46:36.010
achieve an 84 six should be alright

1:46:30.719,1:46:38.729
young Claire I get up from Cuba started

1:46:36.010,1:46:41.199
diving when he's just six years of age

1:46:38.729,1:46:49.090
I'm staying back double somersault one

1:46:41.199,1:46:53.590
and a half twist back downing twenty

1:46:49.090,1:46:56.820
seconds so he needs to point out a solid

1:46:53.590,1:46:56.820
score here to keep in touch

1:47:00.250,1:47:04.630
certainly got through the twist nice and

1:47:02.620,1:47:09.370
early but a little bit of an angle on

1:47:04.630,1:47:10.780
the entry just a touch short see how the

1:47:09.370,1:47:13.060
hands have got to move they tend to put

1:47:10.780,1:47:14.350
one behind there the back of the head

1:47:13.060,1:47:16.210
and one down the side and they're

1:47:14.350,1:47:19.150
straight away then changing hand

1:47:16.210,1:47:22.110
position as they as they dive unravels

1:47:19.150,1:47:24.100
they're 70 point four four angry they're

1:47:22.110,1:47:25.780
awful lot to think about him what

1:47:24.100,1:47:29.170
amounts to about one point eight seconds

1:47:25.780,1:47:31.270
the dive takes a lot of moving parts to

1:47:29.170,1:47:35.790
get aligned at the last moment for the

1:47:31.270,1:47:42.910
entry bond or from Ukraine

1:47:35.790,1:47:46.360
eighteen-year-old back three and a half

1:47:42.910,1:47:50.470
somersault there and they say teeth he

1:47:46.360,1:47:53.860
has just nailed one there aleksander

1:47:50.470,1:47:55.930
bond or he's he's gonna be happy with it

1:47:53.860,1:47:58.270
school here surely because he has ripped

1:47:55.930,1:48:03.820
a wonderful entry and the nines are

1:47:58.270,1:48:05.350
coming for bond or that should really

1:48:03.820,1:48:07.870
have taken him away from that position

1:48:05.350,1:48:09.520
right on the edge of the cut at eighteen

1:48:07.870,1:48:13.420
that's just a bit too uncomfortable

1:48:09.520,1:48:14.890
going into the closing rounds don't

1:48:13.420,1:48:18.460
think of Ukraine as a place where they

1:48:14.890,1:48:20.590
play billiards but he does good hobby

1:48:18.460,1:48:23.700
away from diving everyone needs a

1:48:20.590,1:48:28.300
distraction from their main focus they

1:48:23.700,1:48:30.090
find other things to do get crazy with

1:48:28.300,1:48:33.970
only one focus

1:48:30.090,1:48:35.740
Chiho Park from Korea twenty-fourth

1:48:33.970,1:48:40.210
reverse two-and-a-half somersault just

1:48:35.740,1:48:41.680
2.9 the tariff here it's not going to

1:48:40.210,1:48:43.360
get him a huge amount of marks will

1:48:41.680,1:48:46.180
you've got a low tariff dive you've got

1:48:43.360,1:48:49.770
to get as much technical standard as

1:48:46.180,1:48:49.770
possible together decent score

1:48:52.409,1:48:57.610
competitors from north and south of the

1:48:55.810,1:48:59.980
border in Korea just finding this level

1:48:57.610,1:49:04.349
of competition beyond them it would seem

1:48:59.980,1:49:04.349
in these preliminaries

1:49:13.670,1:49:23.900
so Parker 37 7 so I don't think we will

1:49:18.650,1:49:27.590
see him in action in the morning Victor

1:49:23.900,1:49:31.100
mini PI F arm stand back double

1:49:27.590,1:49:35.420
somersault two and a half twists in 11th

1:49:31.100,1:49:41.960
position 3.6 the degree of difficulty

1:49:35.420,1:49:45.010
here European silver medalist in his

1:49:41.960,1:49:45.010
first Olympic Games

1:49:53.480,1:49:58.800
getting that long hold at the top it was

1:49:56.880,1:50:01.590
an impressive rise to handstand

1:49:58.800,1:50:04.679
initially held it for quite a long time

1:50:01.590,1:50:09.139
and didn't execute the back end of the

1:50:04.679,1:50:12.690
dive through the twist spots the water

1:50:09.139,1:50:13.920
and I think that really the entry is the

1:50:12.690,1:50:15.389
only thing he's going to get penalized

1:50:13.920,1:50:17.639
for because the rest of the dive looked

1:50:15.389,1:50:22.560
very tired a nice leg form good position

1:50:17.639,1:50:32.989
and just can't keep the splashdown 77

1:50:22.560,1:50:36.600
for Alvin Mexicans again who have a

1:50:32.989,1:50:39.840
strong diving tradition having a more

1:50:36.600,1:50:45.510
than respectable Games to silver and a

1:50:39.840,1:50:49.260
bronze so far in these games and German

1:50:45.510,1:50:51.960
Sanchez is fourth so far in this proven

1:50:49.260,1:50:55.489
Eric competition to have tough dive this

1:50:51.960,1:50:59.600
one Roger in with four a half somersault

1:50:55.489,1:50:59.600
how close to the board he gets

1:51:06.409,1:51:11.579
but to push out and then dive having you

1:51:09.389,1:51:13.619
and get through those somersaults so

1:51:11.579,1:51:18.090
quickly you just gotta rip them around

1:51:13.619,1:51:19.940
to have any chance to get there's no

1:51:18.090,1:51:23.760
running jump at these four and a half

1:51:19.940,1:51:27.719
somersaults so that's why it attracts

1:51:23.760,1:51:29.760
the four point one he's through at least

1:51:27.719,1:51:33.929
two before he comes back down level with

1:51:29.760,1:51:35.820
that ten meter board and a ninety eight

1:51:33.929,1:51:42.630
point four without big difficulty

1:51:35.820,1:51:45.929
working off those scores of eight he's

1:51:42.630,1:51:49.020
comfortably back tomorrow and with force

1:51:45.929,1:51:52.079
overnight perhaps of just how much

1:51:49.020,1:51:54.389
potential he can bring to bear come the

1:51:52.079,1:51:56.130
end of the day Riley McCormack getting

1:51:54.389,1:52:00.300
up into an arm stand back triple

1:51:56.130,1:52:07.230
somersault for three point three ranked

1:52:00.300,1:52:09.599
13 the Canadian he's just over-rotated a

1:52:07.230,1:52:13.880
little on the entry who is up to the

1:52:09.599,1:52:13.880
handstand the arm stand very confidently

1:52:17.750,1:52:29.100
competed in Beijing when he was just 16

1:52:21.710,1:52:31.320
finished 16th that's 10 meters he will

1:52:29.100,1:52:36.780
be looking to build on that back for

1:52:31.320,1:52:38.850
years later at 69 3 the McCormick is

1:52:36.780,1:52:43.800
allow us to his for dive so far so

1:52:38.850,1:52:45.389
ranging from that up to 80 now what are

1:52:43.800,1:52:49.159
we gonna get from Matthew Mitchum the

1:52:45.389,1:52:51.389
defending champion Eminem they call him

1:52:49.159,1:52:52.409
well he's a bit like a box of chocolates

1:52:51.389,1:52:54.420
you're not sure what you're gonna get

1:52:52.409,1:52:57.090
he's been a little bit inconsistent at

1:52:54.420,1:52:58.650
least in this competition reversed three

1:52:57.090,1:53:01.250
and a half somersault with a three point

1:52:58.650,1:53:01.250
three Terrace

1:53:02.330,1:53:08.429
well the splash will tell you a bit and

1:53:06.840,1:53:11.580
he doesn't want to pop his head up too

1:53:08.429,1:53:14.370
early he won't be too thrilled with the

1:53:11.580,1:53:16.739
execution here he started as a

1:53:14.370,1:53:19.139
trampoline list as well competing at

1:53:16.739,1:53:20.400
World Junior Championship level and

1:53:19.139,1:53:23.880
nearly got to an Olympics in

1:53:20.400,1:53:27.830
trampolining which has become quite a

1:53:23.880,1:53:27.830
popular sport in Australia

1:53:28.560,1:53:33.880
he's certainly putting some pressure on

1:53:30.790,1:53:35.410
himself to make tomorrow morning it's

1:53:33.880,1:53:39.600
got to be more there there's obviously a

1:53:35.410,1:53:42.640
lot more there can he dig it out though

1:53:39.600,1:53:44.860
you know returning Olympic champions has

1:53:42.640,1:53:46.239
found it so hard to replicate all the

1:53:44.860,1:53:51.790
distractions that happen in the

1:53:46.239,1:53:59.800
intervening years Armond gives me Vic

1:53:51.790,1:54:01.600
from Norway the 21 year old a traverse

1:53:59.800,1:54:05.469
two and a half somersault only had a two

1:54:01.600,1:54:07.870
point sound seven tariffs so it demands

1:54:05.469,1:54:10.750
a high level of execution and he didn't

1:54:07.870,1:54:13.180
have it Roger there's a major splash at

1:54:10.750,1:54:15.430
the end of this kicked it out quite

1:54:13.180,1:54:20.140
elegantly but then the toes weren't

1:54:15.430,1:54:23.310
pointed the angle wasn't right and he's

1:54:20.140,1:54:23.310
being marked down

1:54:27.070,1:54:33.639
it was very good until it wasn't very

1:54:31.570,1:54:40.780
few Norwegians making it to this level

1:54:33.639,1:54:44.920
of competition francesco de Lomo from

1:54:40.780,1:54:48.159
italy 15 back three and a half

1:54:44.920,1:54:50.110
somersault can't afford to get anything

1:54:48.159,1:54:53.760
radically wrong just needs to keep it

1:54:50.110,1:54:53.760
solid to make sure he's back tomorrow

1:54:56.130,1:55:01.239
yeah what a bit of water there and he

1:54:59.349,1:55:04.239
was up so quickly didn't really manage

1:55:01.239,1:55:07.300
to pull the dive down into the water and

1:55:04.239,1:55:09.159
minimize the splash he he's got two

1:55:07.300,1:55:13.060
dives of this difficulty three point

1:55:09.159,1:55:19.270
three and he's coming at such an angle

1:55:13.060,1:55:22.170
he's popped up straight away and not

1:55:19.270,1:55:22.170
made the most of this

1:55:27.370,1:55:32.950
just couldn't pull the air in after him

1:55:29.350,1:55:34.960
and a41 2:5 for francesco that will not

1:55:32.950,1:55:39.070
help because he's in that area between

1:55:34.960,1:55:43.330
sort of 15 and 20 top 18 to progress

1:55:39.070,1:55:43.990
remember Christopher s Gilson from

1:55:43.330,1:55:46.900
Sweden

1:55:43.990,1:55:50.590
23 year old back three and a half

1:55:46.900,1:55:53.980
somersault he's 16th just making the cut

1:55:50.590,1:55:59.740
at the moment three point three the

1:55:53.980,1:56:02.440
tariff here oh yeah

1:55:59.740,1:56:03.850
and the crowd gasps and we'll just leave

1:56:02.440,1:56:06.550
that one to the judges because you saw

1:56:03.850,1:56:09.730
as well as we did he would have seen

1:56:06.550,1:56:11.350
that a diver before him duomo in a

1:56:09.730,1:56:15.010
similar position in terms of rankings

1:56:11.350,1:56:16.690
make a mistake and he had a chance to

1:56:15.010,1:56:20.860
capitalize just made him move up that

1:56:16.690,1:56:26.440
one more spot but if anything he's put

1:56:20.860,1:56:28.180
in a worst dive 39 6s Gilson so tough

1:56:26.440,1:56:30.220
for pressure but you that's what the

1:56:28.180,1:56:34.300
sport is you just have to deliver it on

1:56:30.220,1:56:35.830
the day I won't go a goal down and pull

1:56:34.300,1:56:37.290
it back in the second half it's just not

1:56:35.830,1:56:43.210
that sort of an event

1:56:37.290,1:56:45.130
Eric st. from Canada that's better

1:56:43.210,1:56:46.990
he's had a fairly wretched night until

1:56:45.130,1:56:51.810
now forward three and a half somersault

1:56:46.990,1:56:54.190
there with a 3.0 degree of difficulty

1:56:51.810,1:56:56.680
well this was the dive he could manage

1:56:54.190,1:56:58.990
he's control and really a little bit

1:56:56.680,1:56:59.620
bent in that Pike position it has to be

1:56:58.990,1:57:06.420
acknowledged

1:56:59.620,1:57:09.130
entry a lot better some very successful

1:57:06.420,1:57:10.510
synchro divers do find it a different

1:57:09.130,1:57:13.180
proposition where they can up there on

1:57:10.510,1:57:16.030
their own and it's all about the

1:57:13.180,1:57:18.250
execution and there's no backup scores

1:57:16.030,1:57:21.370
for the synchronization which counts

1:57:18.250,1:57:24.490
very heavily in the team event as they

1:57:21.370,1:57:26.910
call it now our friend Brian Lomas from

1:57:24.490,1:57:26.910
Malaysia

1:57:28.289,1:57:32.269
reverse three-and-a-half somersault

1:57:34.729,1:57:39.829
that's better he's had a slightly

1:57:37.169,1:57:42.569
erratic evening himself and some of the

1:57:39.829,1:57:44.609
Malaysian support for him I'm sure he's

1:57:42.569,1:57:47.689
a bit of a legend back home the nation

1:57:44.609,1:57:50.329
doesn't turn out an enormous number of

1:57:47.689,1:57:52.859
athletes on the world stage

1:57:50.329,1:57:54.599
insert Olympic Games carried the flag

1:57:52.859,1:57:56.179
for Malaysia in the opening ceremony

1:57:54.599,1:57:58.139
back in 2004

1:57:56.179,1:58:03.149
well I believe he was the youngest

1:57:58.139,1:58:09.089
smallest and lightest at participant I'm

1:58:03.149,1:58:18.329
sure he managed the flag okay and a

1:58:09.089,1:58:22.289
seventy four to five back up now towards

1:58:18.329,1:58:26.579
the top of the rankings with the Mexican

1:58:22.289,1:58:30.479
even Garcia armed stand back double

1:58:26.579,1:58:32.819
somersault two and a half twists three

1:58:30.479,1:58:35.519
point six the multiplier here and he's

1:58:32.819,1:58:38.219
in a decent position six after round

1:58:35.519,1:58:41.879
three and you sense real confidence in

1:58:38.219,1:58:44.189
the Mexican camp legs spread wide before

1:58:41.879,1:58:46.669
close together to get that hold position

1:58:44.189,1:58:46.669
just right

1:58:50.550,1:58:56.230
yeah well reasonably tidy

1:58:54.420,1:58:59.590
three-point-six the degree of difficulty

1:58:56.230,1:59:01.750
so it will be boosted by that but there

1:58:59.590,1:59:04.450
were just a question mark about whether

1:59:01.750,1:59:06.430
he got through all the twists in time to

1:59:04.450,1:59:08.320
straighten up and achieve that vertical

1:59:06.430,1:59:11.050
position and he was a little hinged at

1:59:08.320,1:59:15.370
the hips is it giving the camera away

1:59:11.050,1:59:20.880
with a taupe that is an angle isn't it

1:59:15.370,1:59:24.340
we've got them all covered here 81

1:59:20.880,1:59:28.620
arriving 91 different recognized

1:59:24.340,1:59:28.620
platform dives you can pick from

1:59:28.800,1:59:36.600
everyone a a challenge some greater than

1:59:33.640,1:59:36.600
others to say the least

1:59:36.840,1:59:44.130
Nick McCrory's up next from the United

1:59:39.550,1:59:48.270
States a synchro bronze medalist

1:59:44.130,1:59:48.270
reversed three and a half somersault

1:59:52.720,1:59:58.250
well ranked 12th coming into this dive

1:59:56.390,2:00:00.170
number four and I don't think you'll be

1:59:58.250,2:00:02.150
giving up ground there there was a very

2:00:00.170,2:00:05.540
decent effort a little bit of a splash

2:00:02.150,2:00:08.240
on entry but reaching for the sky

2:00:05.540,2:00:10.880
tucking in tight getting through them as

2:00:08.240,2:00:13.670
well reaching for the water pretty good

2:00:10.880,2:00:15.620
position but the smaller splash you'll

2:00:13.670,2:00:16.160
see but a very solid job done with his

2:00:15.620,2:00:17.960
dive

2:00:16.160,2:00:19.580
I'm sure he will have set himself the

2:00:17.960,2:00:23.960
target of reaching the final tomorrow

2:00:19.580,2:00:28.340
evening he's finished six for the world

2:00:23.960,2:00:30.410
championships last year 70 9.2 his

2:00:28.340,2:00:33.050
chances not damaged by that anything

2:00:30.410,2:00:38.050
around the 80 keeps you just bubbling

2:00:33.050,2:00:42.140
along and heading for more competition

2:00:38.050,2:00:44.270
quasi Guerra his fourth dives an arm

2:00:42.140,2:00:47.410
stand reverse triple somersault he's

2:00:44.270,2:00:50.990
back down in 30th position

2:00:47.410,2:00:58.120
Huber's greatest ever diver and he's the

2:00:50.990,2:01:01.630
oldest diver in the competition oh well

2:00:58.120,2:01:03.920
let's ease three-point-four tariffs he

2:01:01.630,2:01:08.200
just be about to make a bit of a

2:01:03.920,2:01:11.030
statement here at 33 years of age

2:01:08.200,2:01:14.480
she's fourth Olympics competed in five

2:01:11.030,2:01:17.210
World Championships so he knows what

2:01:14.480,2:01:22.040
it's all about and suddenly pulling out

2:01:17.210,2:01:24.260
that level I wonder he's really not it's

2:01:22.040,2:01:27.020
got a little bit of competition to come

2:01:24.260,2:01:31.280
and if he can replicate that why not

2:01:27.020,2:01:33.670
ninety-five point two races up to 17th

2:01:31.280,2:01:35.870
but with them what a few divers to come

2:01:33.670,2:01:36.910
well will you produce so down over that

2:01:35.870,2:01:39.070
standard you're going to be absolutely

2:01:36.910,2:01:44.350
devastated if you don't make the cut

2:01:39.070,2:01:44.350
Sebastian via in Colombia

2:01:47.840,2:01:55.260
well he's gonna struggle to make the cut

2:01:51.320,2:02:00.050
25th coming in to this fourth dive and

2:01:55.260,2:02:04.410
the feet just roll over not not badly so

2:02:00.050,2:02:08.000
max of seven coming to us via the PA and

2:02:04.410,2:02:11.660
perhaps you can hear them too the

2:02:08.000,2:02:23.550
calculation is done and he's at other

2:02:11.660,2:02:27.410
77.7 next up David Boudia from the

2:02:23.550,2:02:30.120
United States 16 national titles a

2:02:27.410,2:02:35.610
distinguished career reverse three and a

2:02:30.120,2:02:38.160
half somersault well now he was eight

2:02:35.610,2:02:41.040
coming into this dive some consternation

2:02:38.160,2:02:45.870
there it's the vertical position was

2:02:41.040,2:02:47.520
certainly was not achieved through the

2:02:45.870,2:02:50.210
tucks early he's looking for the water

2:02:47.520,2:02:50.210
now and

2:02:55.910,2:03:09.230
and one fake just rolled over big splash

2:02:58.790,2:03:12.380
their head drops 44 5 5 that'll send him

2:03:09.230,2:03:15.740
into the trouble area I think you'll be

2:03:12.380,2:03:18.380
alright now comes the man setting all

2:03:15.740,2:03:20.840
the standards to bow the 19 year old

2:03:18.380,2:03:25.570
with a back three and a half somersault

2:03:20.840,2:03:25.570
piked let's just enjoy it

2:03:30.239,2:03:41.520
oh and enjoy it we do he's averaging 90

2:03:36.870,2:03:43.710
for his first three dives really gets

2:03:41.520,2:03:46.680
some power off the platform straight

2:03:43.710,2:03:48.390
into such a tight position pulls it

2:03:46.680,2:03:50.190
around saves it a little he seemed to be

2:03:48.390,2:03:53.400
a bit short coming to the water but then

2:03:50.190,2:03:55.320
he's got this ability to minimize the

2:03:53.400,2:04:00.000
splash and rip an entry even without

2:03:55.320,2:04:04.790
perfect position Finas world diver of

2:04:00.000,2:04:06.690
the year last year that's solid again

2:04:04.790,2:04:09.090
even when they don't reach the absolute

2:04:06.690,2:04:12.120
heights they never let their standards

2:04:09.090,2:04:14.730
drop 86.4 he's had two of those and two

2:04:12.120,2:04:18.890
dives in the 90s it just churned them

2:04:14.730,2:04:21.870
out nothing Sasha Klein from Germany has

2:04:18.890,2:04:28.010
had a good evening so far this is a back

2:04:21.870,2:04:28.010
three-and-a-half somersault very nice

2:04:29.659,2:04:35.540
in the pike position so it just presents

2:04:33.770,2:04:40.070
a different look for the judges to

2:04:35.540,2:04:42.260
consider here piked obviously when they

2:04:40.070,2:04:43.940
grab it behind the knees legs straight

2:04:42.260,2:04:50.389
out as opposed to be tucked when they're

2:04:43.940,2:04:56.690
up there in the ball five foot eight

2:04:50.389,2:04:59.060
there's a more powerful type of guy very

2:04:56.690,2:05:00.739
strongly through his dive they're not

2:04:59.060,2:05:02.570
only one eight two so he's had two

2:05:00.739,2:05:07.520
schools in the 90s with dives three and

2:05:02.570,2:05:12.980
four buddy

2:05:07.520,2:05:16.580
clap to 17th back two and a half

2:05:12.980,2:05:18.980
somersault one the half twist three

2:05:16.580,2:05:23.620
point two the Terry fair can't afford to

2:05:18.980,2:05:26.540
drop too far back it's a steady effort

2:05:23.620,2:05:32.540
such a distraction to him preceding a

2:05:26.540,2:05:39.580
British diver not disrespectful just

2:05:32.540,2:05:39.580
excited and seventh year for kept or

2:05:40.510,2:05:47.239
could have been a bit tighter in their

2:05:43.330,2:05:51.440
thighs to chest you'll still be

2:05:47.239,2:05:53.929
loitering around the bubble we think up

2:05:51.440,2:05:56.150
to it rather 10 meters platform is one

2:05:53.929,2:05:59.449
of the hot tickets three Olympic Games

2:05:56.150,2:06:02.480
and they were all pretty hot and they've

2:05:59.449,2:06:04.610
all turned out to see Tom Daley who won

2:06:02.480,2:06:08.690
the national under-18 title when he was

2:06:04.610,2:06:12.310
only ten forward for a half somersault

2:06:08.690,2:06:12.310
tucks three point seven

2:06:16.630,2:06:21.590
well the crowd liked it a little more

2:06:18.950,2:06:26.030
than the judges will I think he he was a

2:06:21.590,2:06:28.850
little at an angle on entry saved it

2:06:26.030,2:06:31.040
quite well in terms of the splash but

2:06:28.850,2:06:35.090
just check how vertical he was at the

2:06:31.040,2:06:37.370
moment he hit the water and he wasn't

2:06:35.090,2:06:41.020
quite there and the feet were just a

2:06:37.370,2:06:41.020
little split as well

2:06:47.360,2:06:54.750
well the nation loves him I think and an

2:06:52.710,2:07:03.590
eighty three to five for Tom that he's

2:06:54.750,2:07:06.719
certainly on that form for the semies on

2:07:03.590,2:07:10.340
Keala beanie twenty-eighth now has a

2:07:06.719,2:07:12.719
reverse three and a half somersault

2:07:10.340,2:07:15.450
three point three the tariff for the

2:07:12.719,2:07:19.219
Italian just towards the bottom of the

2:07:15.450,2:07:19.219
field so it needs something special here

2:07:20.719,2:07:26.190
just not as tight not as convincing not

2:07:24.510,2:07:29.040
taking up as good a position for the

2:07:26.190,2:07:33.570
last moment of the dive some of the more

2:07:29.040,2:07:35.760
experienced men toes need to be pointed

2:07:33.570,2:07:37.950
here they kind of got there towards the

2:07:35.760,2:07:44.130
end but they're just just some form

2:07:37.950,2:07:46.469
errors that the judges identify here and

2:07:44.130,2:07:49.710
he's not fully straightening for the

2:07:46.469,2:07:52.739
last moment and fifty four for five for

2:07:49.710,2:07:58.710
Andrea you'll stay in the bottom half

2:07:52.739,2:08:05.160
doesn't next up it's who got a Parisi

2:07:58.710,2:08:07.310
from Brazil there's olympic games for

2:08:05.160,2:08:07.310
him

2:08:08.770,2:08:16.070
semi-finals would represent progress but

2:08:11.560,2:08:18.380
back in 29th this arm stand back double

2:08:16.070,2:08:22.690
somersault two and a half twists needs

2:08:18.380,2:08:22.690
to be absolutely on the money

2:08:29.280,2:08:34.380
well looked to have a good position here

2:08:32.520,2:08:41.010
in the arm stand pushed away with good

2:08:34.380,2:08:42.690
strength twist four okay not too much

2:08:41.010,2:08:45.360
wrong with that dive except her for the

2:08:42.690,2:08:48.890
finish not leaving that good impression

2:08:45.360,2:08:48.890
for the judges but seventy five six

2:08:49.220,2:08:55.440
Peter Waterfield was the Commonwealth

2:08:52.740,2:08:57.990
Games gold medalist in Manchester said

2:08:55.440,2:09:00.230
the home cloud inspired him and he needs

2:08:57.990,2:09:02.850
a bit of that from these supporters now

2:09:00.230,2:09:09.480
to keep up the progress because the last

2:09:02.850,2:09:11.550
dive was a belter pulled out of 90 this

2:09:09.480,2:09:16.400
is a back three and a half somersault

2:09:11.550,2:09:16.400
tucks just the three point three terrace

2:09:20.720,2:09:26.970
well again one of those dives where the

2:09:23.880,2:09:28.440
athlete saves the entry even though they

2:09:26.970,2:09:29.820
weren't quite vertical and with a three

2:09:28.440,2:09:31.620
point three instead of a three point

2:09:29.820,2:09:33.480
seven difficulty which was the case of

2:09:31.620,2:09:36.300
his previous driver who can't hope to

2:09:33.480,2:09:42.450
score around 90 he didn't get to the

2:09:36.300,2:09:45.360
vertical minimal splash but not optimal

2:09:42.450,2:09:47.600
position he's still arching on his way

2:09:45.360,2:09:47.600
in

2:09:47.760,2:09:53.300
it's gonna give the crowd a difficult

2:09:49.680,2:09:53.300
evening because he's flirting with

2:09:53.750,2:09:59.280
qualification 18 remember we're looking

2:09:56.220,2:10:03.810
for from this evening who will be back

2:09:59.280,2:10:05.610
here at 10 o'clock in the morning a long

2:10:03.810,2:10:08.070
wait for this competition at the Olympic

2:10:05.610,2:10:11.190
Games right to the end before getting

2:10:08.070,2:10:14.580
underway and here is the standings after

2:10:11.190,2:10:18.540
four of six dives chuubo Sasha Klein

2:10:14.580,2:10:21.330
really impressive Lynn you a german

2:10:18.540,2:10:24.120
sanchez galperin to mexican divers Tom

2:10:21.330,2:10:27.960
Daley up to seventh now gradually

2:10:24.120,2:10:29.790
working his way up the field doing a bit

2:10:27.960,2:10:35.160
of a mo farah mainly working his way up

2:10:29.790,2:10:36.270
the field now this is the important cuts

2:10:35.160,2:10:38.310
David Boudia

2:10:36.270,2:10:39.989
more uncomfortable than he will have

2:10:38.310,2:10:41.520
flight young Jimmy Conner just

2:10:39.989,2:10:43.380
scrambling the right side of the line

2:10:41.520,2:10:45.660
but only were less than three points

2:10:43.380,2:10:48.870
ahead of you and Claire Aguilar and

2:10:45.660,2:10:50.310
Peter Waterfield is pulling up there and

2:10:48.870,2:10:52.200
trying to claw back the ground he lost

2:10:50.310,2:10:55.200
with those opening dives it's pretty

2:10:52.200,2:10:56.910
much halved the deficit he had after the

2:10:55.200,2:10:59.430
previous round he was some 18 to 20

2:10:56.910,2:11:01.950
points adrift of the cutoff and now he's

2:10:59.430,2:11:05.040
only nine behind so you know he's got

2:11:01.950,2:11:06.660
two dives left and can be done that's

2:11:05.040,2:11:10.700
for sure he's doing it the hard way

2:11:06.660,2:11:13.730
though I'm necessary pressure you think

2:11:10.700,2:11:18.330
they've galperin kicking us off again oh

2:11:13.730,2:11:20.400
dear he's just switched off well we said

2:11:18.330,2:11:23.340
it's a long night I caught one the diver

2:11:20.400,2:11:29.960
having a bit of a yawn in the recovery

2:11:23.340,2:11:33.330
pool a moment ago and this is just

2:11:29.960,2:11:38.220
terrible entries at completely the wrong

2:11:33.330,2:11:40.710
entry angle and a 3465 for galperin he

2:11:38.220,2:11:44.060
doesn't score that too often it was

2:11:40.710,2:11:46.410
ranked fifth so he stopped slack but

2:11:44.060,2:11:49.290
what device doing that tomorrow if he

2:11:46.410,2:11:51.710
makes the cut successfully enough Lynn

2:11:49.290,2:11:51.710
you a

2:11:53.770,2:11:58.090
from China arm stand back double

2:11:56.260,2:12:01.690
somersault two and a half twists worth

2:11:58.090,2:12:05.830
three point six and he is in third place

2:12:01.690,2:12:08.890
after four dives his dives of seventy

2:12:05.830,2:12:16.660
eighty ninety and a hundred in that

2:12:08.890,2:12:19.540
region from Guangdong province five foot

2:12:16.660,2:12:22.690
four eight zone five pretty perfect size

2:12:19.540,2:12:25.150
and shape map for a diver and again he's

2:12:22.690,2:12:27.670
done a nice job of retrieving the dive

2:12:25.150,2:12:30.340
at the end here the ankles lost each

2:12:27.670,2:12:32.470
other at the top but he found the water

2:12:30.340,2:12:36.010
well and didn't make much of a splash

2:12:32.470,2:12:40.300
and the judges want to give him high

2:12:36.010,2:12:46.030
AIT's just corkscrewing his way through

2:12:40.300,2:12:50.950
the air and into the water and a ninety

2:12:46.030,2:12:54.700
one point eight well a three point seven

2:12:50.950,2:13:00.340
difficulty certainly assists Victor

2:12:54.700,2:13:07.330
Ortega 16 right side of the line for the

2:13:00.340,2:13:13.060
Colombian and he should stay there too

2:13:07.330,2:13:14.710
that's a lovely dive from Ortega taken

2:13:13.060,2:13:16.380
swing when he was just three years of

2:13:14.710,2:13:18.820
age by his parents because he was

2:13:16.380,2:13:22.840
struggling with that and with asthma and

2:13:18.820,2:13:24.550
they felt the exercise would do him a

2:13:22.840,2:13:28.020
lot of good so another example they have

2:13:24.550,2:13:32.260
just how much a sporting lifestyle can

2:13:28.020,2:13:35.910
help your overall health providing you

2:13:32.260,2:13:35.910
can dive off a ten meter board of course

2:13:39.060,2:13:48.720
and Victor Tiger an 84 1/5 keeps himself

2:13:43.290,2:13:51.310
very much in contention to continue

2:13:48.720,2:13:55.750
Anton Zeck off with an arm stand back

2:13:51.310,2:13:58.020
triple somersault nice so he's fairly

2:13:55.750,2:14:02.500
comfortable

2:13:58.020,2:14:05.500
watch his Pike position in this one Lord

2:14:02.500,2:14:08.860
no I didn't like it he he wasn't very

2:14:05.500,2:14:12.520
straight with his legs and the hands go

2:14:08.860,2:14:15.610
to the faces of his little cheer squad

2:14:12.520,2:14:17.200
there and he was all over the place the

2:14:15.610,2:14:20.440
knees were bent initially got it to a

2:14:17.200,2:14:24.150
straight position then twisted and was

2:14:20.440,2:14:28.860
that less than a perfect angle coming in

2:14:24.150,2:14:28.860
and that'll hurt 47:25

2:14:33.900,2:14:38.440
but all know that if they do progress

2:14:36.310,2:14:42.640
through to tomorrow and then tomorrow

2:14:38.440,2:14:45.520
evening that a poor dive is just not on

2:14:42.640,2:14:47.280
if they have genuine ambitions of being

2:14:45.520,2:14:52.000
in contention for the medals

2:14:47.280,2:14:54.880
Timofey or de chick from Belarus he's

2:14:52.000,2:15:00.730
left himself too much to do ranked 29th

2:14:54.880,2:15:03.699
coming into this one see he controlled

2:15:00.730,2:15:06.190
that dive really well and but the better

2:15:03.699,2:15:08.290
bit of guys can just give that

2:15:06.190,2:15:09.969
impression for the judges with much less

2:15:08.290,2:15:13.360
splash than this he seems to hit the

2:15:09.969,2:15:16.120
water very vertically and then doesn't

2:15:13.360,2:15:19.449
control what happens after him he's

2:15:16.120,2:15:22.290
reached finals in the synchronised

2:15:19.449,2:15:25.750
events at World Championship level but

2:15:22.290,2:15:29.430
again finding it harder to make an

2:15:25.750,2:15:29.430
impact in the individual competition

2:15:33.780,2:15:40.630
he's young Keon Jewry from the

2:15:37.570,2:15:43.050
Democratic People's Republic of Korea 16

2:15:40.630,2:15:43.050
year old

2:15:48.309,2:15:52.429
well I know that's a big splash but

2:15:51.079,2:15:54.530
that's actually one of his better dives

2:15:52.429,2:15:57.590
in this competition for real and the

2:15:54.530,2:16:00.880
coach looks a little more pleased he's

2:15:57.590,2:16:00.880
had a difficult night

2:16:02.139,2:16:08.389
if the sport is to progress in these

2:16:05.539,2:16:10.280
countries then they have to take the

2:16:08.389,2:16:12.349
risk of bringing divers to this level of

2:16:10.280,2:16:15.949
competition getting that experience and

2:16:12.349,2:16:17.480
try and build that knowledge base and

2:16:15.949,2:16:19.550
it's experience too for the coaching

2:16:17.480,2:16:23.030
staff not just for the competitors the

2:16:19.550,2:16:24.800
whole team gains from the experience how

2:16:23.030,2:16:26.510
to prepare your athletes for competition

2:16:24.800,2:16:28.190
what to say to them before and

2:16:26.510,2:16:31.280
afterwards that's all a learning

2:16:28.190,2:16:32.929
experience for coaches as well as what

2:16:31.280,2:16:34.729
the athletes go through all these

2:16:32.929,2:16:37.899
individual athletes not just in the pool

2:16:34.729,2:16:41.630
but talk about the team behind them

2:16:37.899,2:16:44.990
Jimmy Connor from Australia the 17-year

2:16:41.630,2:16:46.849
old who is 18th right on the edge

2:16:44.990,2:16:52.389
reversed three and a half somersault

2:16:46.849,2:16:58.809
tucked which he has to get fairly right

2:16:52.389,2:16:58.809
so young these vulnerable moments

2:17:04.150,2:17:09.410
well a fairly nice job done with that

2:17:06.830,2:17:14.630
but as I just mentioned he is right on

2:17:09.410,2:17:19.460
the cusp and Jiang Ming Chen is his

2:17:14.630,2:17:21.200
coach quite a lot of Chinese coaches

2:17:19.460,2:17:23.090
working with the diving program in

2:17:21.200,2:17:25.310
Australia and he's getting sevens for

2:17:23.090,2:17:29.380
this you can see for yourself he's not

2:17:25.310,2:17:32.690
quite the entry he would have desired

2:17:29.380,2:17:34.250
you'll have to excuse our understandable

2:17:32.690,2:17:37.210
parental instincts coming in here

2:17:34.250,2:17:39.950
because these are young lads and you do

2:17:37.210,2:17:41.660
if you are a parent and millions out

2:17:39.950,2:17:43.820
there watching will be of course you've

2:17:41.660,2:17:47.140
got to empathize with what these young

2:17:43.820,2:17:49.250
lads are putting themselves through I

2:17:47.140,2:17:51.010
think you'd be pretty proud of all of

2:17:49.250,2:17:55.219
them if they're up there

2:17:51.010,2:17:57.500
Martin Wolfram at 20 a little bit more

2:17:55.219,2:17:59.560
mature he's eighth not doing too badly

2:17:57.500,2:18:01.969
at all back two and a half somersault

2:17:59.560,2:18:05.570
two and a half twists in there as well

2:18:01.969,2:18:08.410
three point six that one didn't quite

2:18:05.570,2:18:11.630
finish it off as he would have wanted

2:18:08.410,2:18:13.820
look good through the ear got all the

2:18:11.630,2:18:20.360
elements completed those ankles very

2:18:13.820,2:18:26.150
much together and again just that last

2:18:20.360,2:18:27.469
aspect judges it's interesting how they

2:18:26.150,2:18:30.410
set them up they can't see each other

2:18:27.469,2:18:32.660
they sort of a partition Golf four and

2:18:30.410,2:18:36.170
one side and three on the other he's

2:18:32.660,2:18:37.880
happy though is Martin and again we must

2:18:36.170,2:18:40.940
emphasize they don't get the front views

2:18:37.880,2:18:43.040
the top views the side views because you

2:18:40.940,2:18:45.200
can see them really maybe your ring or

2:18:43.040,2:18:47.000
not quite getting the the move right

2:18:45.200,2:18:49.490
through all dimensions they've got less

2:18:47.000,2:18:55.010
than two seconds to make the judgment

2:18:49.490,2:18:58.510
call young a Guerra who's 19th and still

2:18:55.010,2:19:00.590
fighting to stay in the competition that

2:18:58.510,2:19:03.500
reversed three and a half somersault

2:19:00.590,2:19:06.800
tucked that looked very good from here I

2:19:03.500,2:19:08.060
think he might just be giving himself a

2:19:06.800,2:19:11.990
bit of room to breathe

2:19:08.060,2:19:14.820
if that's a if that's an expression if

2:19:11.990,2:19:18.519
it wasn't that is now

2:19:14.820,2:19:24.059
breathing room might come out better but

2:19:18.519,2:19:24.059
that was a lovely entry from a grill it

2:19:24.630,2:19:30.250
should have done these calls no end of

2:19:26.800,2:19:31.479
good yeah eighty five point eight helps

2:19:30.250,2:19:35.410
when you're on the bubble and he knows

2:19:31.479,2:19:38.800
that he's he's pleased confidence to

2:19:35.410,2:19:39.880
take him to his last dive sure we're

2:19:38.800,2:19:42.189
gonna see some movement on the

2:19:39.880,2:19:46.019
leaderboard though with the sixth and

2:19:42.189,2:19:48.010
final Alexander bonder from Ukraine

2:19:46.019,2:19:56.530
twelfth reverse four-and-a-half

2:19:48.010,2:20:05.229
somersault tucked when he's good he's

2:19:56.530,2:20:11.590
very good banda ukraine wanted to get to

2:20:05.229,2:20:15.160
athletes to progress eighth in the world

2:20:11.590,2:20:18.700
championships at ten meters in shanghai

2:20:15.160,2:20:20.770
last year did get a little off the

2:20:18.700,2:20:23.110
square bond out but some hair on the way

2:20:20.770,2:20:29.410
down rescued it and does pulled an

2:20:23.110,2:20:31.899
eighty nine point one just had that one

2:20:29.410,2:20:36.490
bad died of his third was of 57

2:20:31.899,2:20:40.840
otherwise in the eighties ji-ho Park

2:20:36.490,2:20:43.899
from Korea he's 31st back two and a half

2:20:40.840,2:20:46.720
somersault one and a half twists just

2:20:43.899,2:20:51.010
needs to put in a nice clean dive to

2:20:46.720,2:20:52.990
give himself some encouragement and he

2:20:51.010,2:20:56.830
does that he's towards the bottom of the

2:20:52.990,2:21:01.720
field ranked 31st coming in to this

2:20:56.830,2:21:04.180
fifth dive and at this point competing

2:21:01.720,2:21:07.870
for pride as we often say it's something

2:21:04.180,2:21:09.910
in that studies and trains at the Korea

2:21:07.870,2:21:12.240
University of physical education in

2:21:09.910,2:21:12.240
Seoul

2:21:17.290,2:21:31.311
70 to his score they're very consistent

2:21:21.610,2:21:33.380
7.5 s run across Victor mini buy of that

2:21:31.311,2:21:37.670
view not for the queasy is it back three

2:21:33.380,2:21:42.280
and a half somersault panicked 32 foot

2:21:37.670,2:21:42.280
10 inches above the water in old money

2:21:44.980,2:21:52.510
back three and a half somersault hiked

2:21:47.660,2:21:52.510
three point six the degree of difficulty

2:21:56.729,2:22:01.899
well he looked so good through the air

2:21:59.710,2:22:05.890
that such a shame that he so spoiled it

2:22:01.899,2:22:07.660
with that finish many by have look at

2:22:05.890,2:22:10.750
the position he achieves here in Pike

2:22:07.660,2:22:13.120
it's those legs are so straight pulls

2:22:10.750,2:22:17.380
for the water now and just over they go

2:22:13.120,2:22:22.090
big splash and that'll hurt many behave

2:22:17.380,2:22:24.010
with a forty eight point six we'd like

2:22:22.090,2:22:28.630
to take that back or at least the last

2:22:24.010,2:22:31.120
bit no margin for error

2:22:28.630,2:22:35.020
well maybe a little bit tonight in terms

2:22:31.120,2:22:36.790
of qualifying but after that you've got

2:22:35.020,2:22:38.939
to get it right across the six dives if

2:22:36.790,2:22:43.689
you go to do yourself

2:22:38.939,2:22:46.870
justice German Sanchez has been fairly

2:22:43.689,2:22:48.850
close to doing that fourth in the

2:22:46.870,2:22:50.560
rankings to date this is his fifth dive

2:22:48.850,2:22:55.090
it's a reverse three and a half

2:22:50.560,2:23:03.130
somersault tucked one of his easier

2:22:55.090,2:23:05.109
dives in relative terms oh he does a

2:23:03.130,2:23:09.399
good job with it too I like him

2:23:05.109,2:23:12.010
German Sanchez I think we will see him

2:23:09.399,2:23:18.550
not just in the semi-final but the final

2:23:12.010,2:23:24.120
he's class spots the water goes in with

2:23:18.550,2:23:24.120
a minimum of fuss and in good position

2:23:24.510,2:23:29.771
he's in the flyweight division remember

2:23:27.040,2:23:37.351
at only 47 K

2:23:29.771,2:23:37.351
seven stone 680 4.15 and he's on his way

2:23:37.740,2:23:43.660
what about Riley McCormick 21 later this

2:23:43.090,2:23:48.851
month

2:23:43.660,2:23:51.690
the Canadian he is 14th verse three and

2:23:48.851,2:23:51.690
a half somersault

2:23:58.580,2:24:04.380
now they gain just a little sloppy at

2:24:01.199,2:24:06.680
the end for Riley who can't make any big

2:24:04.380,2:24:10.160
slip-ups he is only a few positions

2:24:06.680,2:24:10.160
inside the cut

2:24:14.869,2:24:22.069
and again over go the legs and this over

2:24:19.279,2:24:26.389
rotation at the finish the timing is

2:24:22.069,2:24:28.279
just so difficult to get spot-on world

2:24:26.389,2:24:32.179
championship finalist in Shanghai last

2:24:28.279,2:24:34.609
year so he will have definitely said his

2:24:32.179,2:24:38.989
stall out to be here tomorrow night let

2:24:34.609,2:24:40.249
alone tomorrow morning now he'd give him

2:24:38.989,2:24:43.520
ten out of ten for unpredictability

2:24:40.249,2:24:46.759
Matthew Mitchum defending champion and

2:24:43.520,2:24:49.189
this is an arm stand back triple

2:24:46.759,2:24:51.999
somersault and there is a lot of him to

2:24:49.189,2:24:51.999
get up level there

2:25:01.641,2:25:07.620
short he managed to minimize the damage

2:25:05.490,2:25:09.780
with the entry but he wasn't vertical

2:25:07.620,2:25:11.671
and were just gathering an impression or

2:25:09.780,2:25:14.221
at least I am that he's not the diver he

2:25:11.671,2:25:16.110
was four years ago he still loves being

2:25:14.221,2:25:18.421
on the olympic stage clearly with his

2:25:16.110,2:25:20.971
reaction but you see he's short there

2:25:18.421,2:25:23.101
he doesn't like personality it's just

2:25:20.971,2:25:26.271
form he seems to like yes certainly it's

2:25:23.101,2:25:28.500
not Talent we know that he's proved that

2:25:26.271,2:25:30.391
you just feel he's a bit of a natural

2:25:28.500,2:25:32.641
performer if he could just get himself

2:25:30.391,2:25:35.011
in the frame of mind get himself in the

2:25:32.641,2:25:37.230
final he's one of those guys that if he

2:25:35.011,2:25:40.200
has his day it's a good day

2:25:37.230,2:25:42.240
he was on my plane coming over from from

2:25:40.200,2:25:43.500
Sydney and at the airport that people

2:25:42.240,2:25:46.320
just couldn't get enough of me so

2:25:43.500,2:25:48.240
recognizable within Australian and such

2:25:46.320,2:25:53.790
a distraction for him I think at that

2:25:48.240,2:25:55.830
level they're shy Atomics really

2:25:53.790,2:25:57.841
wouldn't be quite right in diving it's a

2:25:55.830,2:26:04.771
it's a show-off sport isn't amazingly

2:25:57.841,2:26:08.480
and here's my vic of norway that's his

2:26:04.771,2:26:08.480
best entry so far giz mervich

2:26:10.500,2:26:17.280
first Norwegians qualified for the

2:26:12.450,2:26:18.750
Olympics remember since 1992 I think

2:26:17.280,2:26:21.420
what you say Rogers is a point worth

2:26:18.750,2:26:23.100
elaborating that some of the divers say

2:26:21.420,2:26:25.260
look our bodies are on display we're

2:26:23.100,2:26:28.590
very much on display you see all of us

2:26:25.260,2:26:30.270
our courage is also exposed and in that

2:26:28.590,2:26:35.480
sense it's no place for shrinking

2:26:30.270,2:26:37.830
violets it's a performance it's a show

2:26:35.480,2:26:39.450
it's the same with the gymnasts as well

2:26:37.830,2:26:41.370
you know you can see they get the

2:26:39.450,2:26:44.100
dismount right and a great smile and

2:26:41.370,2:26:45.450
they love the applause that's the divers

2:26:44.100,2:26:48.350
I wonder how much of the applause they

2:26:45.450,2:26:51.030
hear underwater feeling they sense it

2:26:48.350,2:26:52.620
Francesco Del Amo from Italy with a

2:26:51.030,2:26:55.740
reverse three and a half somersault

2:26:52.620,2:26:58.320
he's 21st not over for him yet mining

2:26:55.740,2:27:01.200
means he needs to get this three point

2:26:58.320,2:27:05.610
three difficulty correct and get some

2:27:01.200,2:27:08.910
points on the board and that's two

2:27:05.610,2:27:12.030
consecutive average dives from Del Amo

2:27:08.910,2:27:15.780
and and he was in contention to be in

2:27:12.030,2:27:19.430
the semi-final two dives ago and it's

2:27:15.780,2:27:19.430
just slipping away from him now

2:27:23.050,2:27:29.050
32 contestants so it's a big field it's

2:27:26.330,2:27:30.710
a long time between the dives but I

2:27:29.050,2:27:34.010
remember in the 3-meter springboard

2:27:30.710,2:27:36.980
which it's probably the most contested

2:27:34.010,2:27:39.710
category of having more than 50 divers

2:27:36.980,2:27:41.720
for a world championship and that is a

2:27:39.710,2:27:47.990
long long competition on a long wait

2:27:41.720,2:27:52.960
between dies sorry Christopher s Gilson

2:27:47.990,2:27:52.960
from Sweden where's he 23rd equal

2:28:02.350,2:28:07.819
well and he whatever is going wrong with

2:28:05.180,2:28:10.100
duomo is going wrong with SQL sin that

2:28:07.819,2:28:11.779
that's twice now but both men have had a

2:28:10.100,2:28:13.520
chance to make a statement late in the

2:28:11.779,2:28:15.589
competition about forcing their way into

2:28:13.520,2:28:21.560
the top 18 and they've just not

2:28:15.589,2:28:25.520
delivered this is a great shame they're

2:28:21.560,2:28:28.159
good enough but there's the pressure in

2:28:25.520,2:28:30.499
that intangible you got the platform you

2:28:28.159,2:28:36.499
got the pool and you got a very short

2:28:30.499,2:28:39.169
amount of time to get it right and it's

2:28:36.499,2:28:42.800
what's between the ears and what they

2:28:39.169,2:28:46.119
can sometimes be the differential Eric

2:28:42.800,2:28:52.999
Sain from Canada's first Olympic Games

2:28:46.119,2:28:54.529
while proving a tough test for him 28

2:28:52.999,2:28:59.839
phases are back three-and-a-half

2:28:54.529,2:29:01.909
somersault Canadians normally send quite

2:28:59.839,2:29:05.149
a strong team with quite a high sense of

2:29:01.909,2:29:07.819
ambition so I think he'll be feeling the

2:29:05.149,2:29:11.029
discomfort here back in 28th position

2:29:07.819,2:29:12.560
before these scores are added in I got

2:29:11.029,2:29:15.859
such a great tradition have an A in the

2:29:12.560,2:29:18.379
sport when look at the deputy Alexander

2:29:15.859,2:29:21.609
one of the Great's of all time really in

2:29:18.379,2:29:23.930
considering his longevity and success

2:29:21.609,2:29:26.649
they've got a couple of bronzes so far

2:29:23.930,2:29:29.600
in this Olympics so the team will be

2:29:26.649,2:29:32.539
feeling confident but he's just not

2:29:29.600,2:29:35.959
Haley's day has he now 49 five there for

2:29:32.539,2:29:38.109
Eric I think he'd like it to to be over

2:29:35.959,2:29:38.109
now

2:29:38.709,2:29:45.020
Ryan Nixon low-mass from Malaysia

2:29:42.489,2:29:47.149
who's 26 he has an inward

2:29:45.020,2:29:50.119
four-and-a-half somersault this is a

2:29:47.149,2:29:53.199
really difficult dive four point one ten

2:29:50.119,2:29:53.199
out of ten for ambition

2:29:56.460,2:30:02.520
oh and we'll give him high marks for

2:29:59.340,2:30:08.069
execution to the coaching staff are

2:30:02.520,2:30:09.359
happy could have just performed himself

2:30:08.069,2:30:11.880
into the next round here

2:30:09.359,2:30:13.649
la masse he's had a little bit of

2:30:11.880,2:30:15.870
inconsistency through his competition

2:30:13.649,2:30:20.760
this evening but a very difficult dive

2:30:15.870,2:30:25.890
done well the degree of difficulty is

2:30:20.760,2:30:28.560
really going to kick him up here smiles

2:30:25.890,2:30:33.870
all around he's won Commonwealth Games

2:30:28.560,2:30:38.580
medals and Asian Games medals so he's

2:30:33.870,2:30:42.080
used to performing and delivering a 96 a

2:30:38.580,2:30:45.290
good score and 36 is a good score I

2:30:42.080,2:30:47.729
can't change very dramatically can't it

2:30:45.290,2:30:49.560
gives you an idea of what lies ahead in

2:30:47.729,2:30:52.859
this competition when it really starts

2:30:49.560,2:30:55.979
to hot up over the next 24 hours this is

2:30:52.859,2:30:58.170
even Garcia in sixth place and he's got

2:30:55.979,2:31:00.800
a reverse three and a half somersault

2:30:58.170,2:31:00.800
tucked here

2:31:11.560,2:31:15.140
I'll be able to hear out

2:31:13.220,2:31:17.510
spanish-speaking colleagues next door

2:31:15.140,2:31:19.399
loving the Mexican performances underway

2:31:17.510,2:31:21.680
on board a lahar die just rolls off the

2:31:19.399,2:31:23.479
tongue it is a beautifully named places

2:31:21.680,2:31:26.840
no I feel like I got to go there just

2:31:23.479,2:31:29.660
because of Guadalajara famous World Cup

2:31:26.840,2:31:32.050
football venue it was in Mexico that's

2:31:29.660,2:31:36.290
where it's famous name in Britain and

2:31:32.050,2:31:37.870
Mexicans are showing that diving as well

2:31:36.290,2:31:40.960
as football is one of their strong

2:31:37.870,2:31:45.010
sports and they're having a good games

2:31:40.960,2:31:49.399
and an eighty five point eight for Ivan

2:31:45.010,2:31:51.710
he's looking pretty secure two silver

2:31:49.399,2:31:53.989
and a bronze for Mexico so far in these

2:31:51.710,2:31:58.160
games and he might fancy adding to that

2:31:53.989,2:32:03.080
if they're two divers really have a big

2:31:58.160,2:32:06.680
night Nick McCrory 10th position back

2:32:03.080,2:32:11.170
three and a half somersault for the

2:32:06.680,2:32:11.170
American bronze synchro medalist

2:32:15.601,2:32:24.551
well I was okay he's had his moments

2:32:20.141,2:32:28.181
tonight as well means that just be

2:32:24.551,2:32:28.650
steady here and make sure he finishes it

2:32:28.181,2:32:30.061
off

2:32:28.650,2:32:34.771
[Music]

2:32:30.061,2:32:34.771
well a top ten diver when he's informed

2:32:34.920,2:32:40.570
they're gonna be back in less than 12

2:32:37.120,2:32:43.330
hours so the schedulers have put them on

2:32:40.570,2:32:47.351
the spot of it I think seven o'clock

2:32:43.330,2:32:49.091
here in the UK started and it's not

2:32:47.351,2:32:50.320
going to finish till after ten o'clock

2:32:49.091,2:32:53.561
and then they're back at ten o'clock in

2:32:50.320,2:32:56.110
the morning time I get home and I might

2:32:53.561,2:32:57.730
need a massage and it is a tight

2:32:56.110,2:32:59.980
schedule isn't and I looked at it and

2:32:57.730,2:33:01.931
thought it's demanding on a number of

2:32:59.980,2:33:03.851
people on nowhere about us between a

2:33:01.931,2:33:06.181
cruise and staff and and of course the

2:33:03.851,2:33:06.181
athletes

2:33:06.210,2:33:11.561
gira he was in 22nd position with a

2:33:10.091,2:33:15.690
reverse three and a half somersault

2:33:11.561,2:33:19.170
there he'll be wanting to have a

2:33:15.690,2:33:19.170
difficult 12 hours

2:33:22.091,2:33:33.070
lots of aids coming in he's really got a

2:33:29.831,2:33:39.160
few places to make up though he's fifth

2:33:33.070,2:33:41.771
and six dives 79 point to 18th with some

2:33:39.160,2:33:43.081
to come though with this fifth dive

2:33:41.771,2:33:46.530
series

2:33:43.081,2:33:49.871
Sebastian veer now 20 year old Colombian

2:33:46.530,2:33:51.940
23rd his ranking back three-and-a-half

2:33:49.871,2:33:56.291
somersault which he delivers very

2:33:51.940,2:33:59.771
quickly he does and delivers well not

2:33:56.291,2:34:03.101
much of a splash from guys only some 54

2:33:59.771,2:34:10.211
kilos and 64 centimeters not a lot of

2:34:03.101,2:34:11.410
him finds the water good entry don't

2:34:10.211,2:34:13.121
think he's got a huge amount of

2:34:11.410,2:34:15.881
experience in this level of competition

2:34:13.121,2:34:19.871
World Championship or Olympic where it's

2:34:15.881,2:34:22.030
a different world and the divers must

2:34:19.871,2:34:25.961
find some of the performances of the top

2:34:22.030,2:34:30.041
competitors intimidating almost not

2:34:25.961,2:34:31.391
David Boudia who's up next though begin

2:34:30.041,2:34:33.811
you're giving a look at the good

2:34:31.391,2:34:36.400
camaraderie down on the pool deck

2:34:33.811,2:34:40.650
opposition coaches give some

2:34:36.400,2:34:43.421
congratulations athletes walking past

2:34:40.650,2:34:47.171
back three and a half somersault for

2:34:43.421,2:34:49.831
David Boudia who is 17th and just living

2:34:47.171,2:34:49.831
on the edge of it

2:34:51.300,2:34:56.190
[Applause]

2:34:53.670,2:35:01.641
those little imperfections we're seeing

2:34:56.190,2:35:01.641
from those below the top five has a

2:35:02.271,2:35:12.690
wonderful pike position stretches

2:35:05.341,2:35:18.980
reaches splashes so 7s 7 and a half's

2:35:12.690,2:35:21.210
the 8 will be discarded and an 81

2:35:18.980,2:35:28.681
difficulty helping him along there with

2:35:21.210,2:35:35.190
a 3.6 tariff she bowed out leading the

2:35:28.681,2:35:38.221
pack here for the 18 year old whoa how

2:35:35.190,2:35:39.931
does he do it we've bounced along that

2:35:38.221,2:35:43.170
board before I got it like as a spring

2:35:39.931,2:35:45.150
board almost yes it a real looping

2:35:43.170,2:35:49.700
approach if you like he's just very

2:35:45.150,2:35:54.420
light on his feet easy through the air

2:35:49.700,2:36:05.101
hits the water and not much of a splash

2:35:54.420,2:36:10.521
of making a few headlines and bow as

2:36:05.101,2:36:10.521
confirming his standing here with a 99.9

2:36:11.210,2:36:15.931
as we said he comes from a very poor

2:36:13.561,2:36:18.690
background he knows that Olympic success

2:36:15.931,2:36:20.280
will transform not only his life but

2:36:18.690,2:36:21.721
none of his family as well this is

2:36:20.280,2:36:24.780
special Kline who's doing very well

2:36:21.721,2:36:27.240
second place reverse straight 1/2

2:36:24.780,2:36:28.891
somersault there so he's trying to split

2:36:27.240,2:36:33.120
the two Chinese

2:36:28.891,2:36:36.591
champions Chu and Lin there's some 20

2:36:33.120,2:36:42.110
points difference between Chu and Lin

2:36:36.591,2:36:47.960
466 to 445 and see if such a client can

2:36:42.110,2:36:47.960
force his way in there very solid dive

2:36:48.080,2:36:54.841
89 126 this really good see him at his

2:36:52.170,2:36:56.450
absolute peak just staying in the zone I

2:36:54.841,2:36:58.790
think they call that

2:36:56.450,2:37:01.670
and he said world there isn't he'll in

2:36:58.790,2:37:03.350
the client just one point behind Liam

2:37:01.670,2:37:05.960
just couldn't sneak in ahead of him but

2:37:03.350,2:37:08.200
an 89 very nice dive great result

2:37:05.960,2:37:11.510
without even cap tour from Belarus

2:37:08.200,2:37:15.830
twenty five-year-old from Minsk 15th

2:37:11.510,2:37:17.740
back three-and-a-half somersault its to

2:37:15.830,2:37:20.870
keep it going

2:37:17.740,2:37:24.110
at four World Championships six European

2:37:20.870,2:37:25.840
Championships got the experience has he

2:37:24.110,2:37:30.410
got the points to keep it going

2:37:25.840,2:37:31.729
it hasn't got the finish there I'm

2:37:30.410,2:37:34.930
afraid they're not cheering that dive

2:37:31.729,2:37:34.930
they're cheering the next competitor

2:37:39.250,2:37:43.810
three point three was the tariff fair

2:37:50.020,2:37:54.200
they give us the names of the athletes

2:37:52.700,2:37:56.930
and some of the sheets we have they

2:37:54.200,2:37:59.210
usually put the last name first when I

2:37:56.930,2:38:00.860
see Thomas daily it's presented to me as

2:37:59.210,2:38:03.500
daily Thomas I nearly want to say Daley

2:38:00.860,2:38:05.890
Thompson though they're quite different

2:38:03.500,2:38:09.350
sports and quite different bills but

2:38:05.890,2:38:11.570
maybe a taste at the same success and

2:38:09.350,2:38:15.189
the great decathlete across to Thomas

2:38:11.570,2:38:17.870
Daley both have tremendous popularity

2:38:15.189,2:38:19.780
Tom Daley 18 years of age and getting

2:38:17.870,2:38:22.220
better as the competition progresses

2:38:19.780,2:38:24.939
back three and a half somersault three

2:38:22.220,2:38:31.820
point six the tariff and he is seventh

2:38:24.939,2:38:34.040
after a shaky start oh my goodness by

2:38:31.820,2:38:36.680
his standards that's a terrible ending

2:38:34.040,2:38:40.290
to that dive

2:38:36.680,2:38:45.090
3.6 degree of difficulty but well I

2:38:40.290,2:38:47.640
think he's embarrassed to come up he's

2:38:45.090,2:38:49.550
putting this home support right through

2:38:47.640,2:38:52.229
the mincer here isn't he

2:38:49.550,2:38:55.500
won't do the confidence of his teammates

2:38:52.229,2:38:58.470
at Peter Waterfield any good he's got to

2:38:55.500,2:39:03.359
come up with two very good dives to make

2:38:58.470,2:39:07.979
it to the semi and in the 39.6 sees him

2:39:03.359,2:39:10.740
tumbled to 1600 is the diver who set new

2:39:07.979,2:39:13.229
British record points totals this year

2:39:10.740,2:39:15.899
we're not seeing it this evening Andrea

2:39:13.229,2:39:20.520
she had a beanie now from Italy for

2:39:15.899,2:39:25.140
three and a half somersault and he's

2:39:20.520,2:39:29.279
just really diving for personal pride

2:39:25.140,2:39:31.800
back in 30th it's one of those young

2:39:29.279,2:39:34.430
divers who will gain enormous leap from

2:39:31.800,2:39:38.100
the opportunity to complete here it's

2:39:34.430,2:39:41.149
not possible if he scores now to be

2:39:38.100,2:39:41.149
progressed to the semi

2:39:47.300,2:39:52.431
just seventeen years of age we must

2:39:49.590,2:39:52.431
emphasize again

2:39:54.261,2:40:02.271
Hugo Parisi and then water-filled

2:39:57.690,2:40:04.650
that'll completely v dies Parisi is 28

2:40:02.271,2:40:08.971
this is a reverse three-and-a-half

2:40:04.650,2:40:19.500
somersault tucked he's in 27th position

2:40:08.971,2:40:21.330
the Brazilian nice dive I just wonder 28

2:40:19.500,2:40:24.061
whether he would be tempted to just hang

2:40:21.330,2:40:25.021
on for Rio in four years time and he'd

2:40:24.061,2:40:30.090
be in his thirties

2:40:25.021,2:40:35.040
it's possible stay injury-free this is

2:40:30.090,2:40:36.931
one of his better ones fairly good

2:40:35.040,2:40:40.681
vertical position for the entry from

2:40:36.931,2:40:42.150
Hugo Parisi toes have got a good grip on

2:40:40.681,2:40:47.700
the end of the platform they're acting

2:40:42.150,2:40:49.590
like hands really with the grip a little

2:40:47.700,2:40:51.480
bit of excitement at the end of every

2:40:49.590,2:40:54.511
series of dives because the last man up

2:40:51.480,2:40:58.250
is the very popular Brit Peter

2:40:54.511,2:41:01.650
Waterfield and he like Tom Daley is

2:40:58.250,2:41:04.740
making sure his many supporters have an

2:41:01.650,2:41:07.170
anxious night he too has been pulling

2:41:04.740,2:41:09.480
his way up the field but he too can not

2:41:07.170,2:41:11.550
afford to blow another dive or reverse

2:41:09.480,2:41:16.320
three and a half somersault he's in 20th

2:41:11.550,2:41:18.540
position and diving to make the cut bit

2:41:16.320,2:41:20.370
of a splash there wasn't there it's not

2:41:18.540,2:41:22.620
what he needed it should have been

2:41:20.370,2:41:24.330
tidier than that to just crawl back a

2:41:22.620,2:41:27.960
few more points and take some more

2:41:24.330,2:41:30.750
pressure off he's fourth dive was so

2:41:27.960,2:41:35.851
good he really did something about his

2:41:30.750,2:41:39.620
position but that splash means he can

2:41:35.851,2:41:39.620
only get sixes and six and a half

2:41:39.891,2:41:45.351
amazing range of dives if between four

2:41:42.601,2:41:47.660
and a half and seven at it that

2:41:45.351,2:41:49.130
there's some inconsistency now those two

2:41:47.660,2:41:51.080
scores come out but you don't want to be

2:41:49.130,2:41:54.940
seeing four and a half and seven as a

2:41:51.080,2:41:54.940
range they've got to be closer than that

2:41:55.420,2:42:03.440
well he's piled all the pressure himself

2:41:58.340,2:42:06.230
for the last dive but it's China 1 & 2

2:42:03.440,2:42:08.630
Sasha Cline the Germany and the two

2:42:06.230,2:42:10.730
Mexican divers and Germany having a good

2:42:08.630,2:42:14.811
good evening Martin Wolfram they're up

2:42:10.730,2:42:17.181
into sixth Matthew Mitchum 10th we

2:42:14.811,2:42:19.880
should at least see him again David

2:42:17.181,2:42:21.920
Boudia as well other big names glib gal

2:42:19.880,2:42:24.141
purina's slipped away a bit like Tom

2:42:21.920,2:42:26.601
Daley glib galperin had a very good

2:42:24.141,2:42:29.271
start Tom Daley that disastrous dive but

2:42:26.601,2:42:32.870
still him with a chance there's the cart

2:42:29.271,2:42:35.840
just behind James Connor hanging on by

2:42:32.870,2:42:38.240
his fingertips budding cap tour and

2:42:35.840,2:42:43.460
Brian Lomas the road the two divers most

2:42:38.240,2:42:44.990
in touch this is also where the program

2:42:43.460,2:42:47.480
you've organized and just where you've

2:42:44.990,2:42:48.950
put your bigger tariffs dives can really

2:42:47.480,2:42:51.051
make the big difference can't it whether

2:42:48.950,2:42:59.480
you've saved it for the end or put them

2:42:51.051,2:43:00.920
in mid competition proud of stayed with

2:42:59.480,2:43:03.590
it commendably all the way through the

2:43:00.920,2:43:05.391
competition got a feeling this is very

2:43:03.590,2:43:08.150
much the appetizer for the big one when

2:43:05.391,2:43:14.030
it starts tomorrow and into tomorrow

2:43:08.150,2:43:18.950
night water filled in 23rd position it's

2:43:14.030,2:43:21.530
tough to come back from the Alperin

2:43:18.950,2:43:23.990
started off like a train that come a

2:43:21.530,2:43:26.090
little bit off the rails in the latter

2:43:23.990,2:43:27.561
stages so he want to make sure he

2:43:26.090,2:43:29.450
finishes strongly with this back two and

2:43:27.561,2:43:33.521
a half somersault two and a half twist

2:43:29.450,2:43:33.521
with a three point six tariff

2:43:35.130,2:43:38.970
yes just to extend the analogy a bit

2:43:37.681,2:43:42.830
further it's a train that's running out

2:43:38.970,2:43:46.351
of steam I think it that entry angle was

2:43:42.830,2:43:49.681
seriously short of vertical he's got

2:43:46.351,2:43:52.820
great dives in him that he needs six

2:43:49.681,2:43:55.290
back-to-back to challenge the top view

2:43:52.820,2:43:58.170
he's got a very distinguished career

2:43:55.290,2:44:01.200
behind him but again those eight

2:43:58.170,2:44:02.910
operations on his back and knee missed

2:44:01.200,2:44:06.391
two years of diving done brilliantly to

2:44:02.910,2:44:08.460
get back but maybe he's just a finding

2:44:06.391,2:44:12.750
it a bit tougher to try and string a

2:44:08.460,2:44:14.641
whole series of dives together 81 points

2:44:12.750,2:44:18.720
there with seven and a half's the marks

2:44:14.641,2:44:21.410
that count he's got an anxious half hour

2:44:18.720,2:44:25.860
just to make sure he comes back again

2:44:21.410,2:44:29.910
you know back at the top of the ranking

2:44:25.860,2:44:32.010
or rough second top Lynne you a has

2:44:29.910,2:44:34.950
beaten queue the world champion at the

2:44:32.010,2:44:37.590
national trials in May so you know he's

2:44:34.950,2:44:39.391
not come here for silver but that is for

2:44:37.590,2:44:45.240
tomorrow of course back to a half

2:44:39.391,2:44:51.900
somersault two and a half twist he's

2:44:45.240,2:44:54.240
some 21 points behind his teammate the

2:44:51.900,2:45:00.780
finish of this dive not quite perfect

2:44:54.240,2:45:04.940
but a very tidy through the air there

2:45:00.780,2:45:04.940
are just beautiful gymnasts

2:45:05.121,2:45:09.091
not too much wrong with that he sort of

2:45:07.291,2:45:12.301
collapsed into that somersault beneath

2:45:09.091,2:45:14.311
the water and it's the crossover of the

2:45:12.301,2:45:20.671
ankles there the judges do well to see

2:45:14.311,2:45:22.980
that and 86.4 had an injury to his waist

2:45:20.671,2:45:25.021
over the last year or twos which is

2:45:22.980,2:45:26.820
unusual must be running cause stomach

2:45:25.021,2:45:27.711
muscles which come under such a lot of

2:45:26.820,2:45:33.421
strain

2:45:27.711,2:45:35.551
Victor Ortega from Colombia he's ninth

2:45:33.421,2:45:39.030
the verse three and a half somersault

2:45:35.551,2:45:40.681
just needs to keep it tidy if you're

2:45:39.030,2:45:44.311
wondering what that tattoo is on his

2:45:40.681,2:45:45.961
lower chest it's life that's what he

2:45:44.311,2:45:48.331
embraces give it everything and that's

2:45:45.961,2:45:52.221
part of his sort of personal philosophy

2:45:48.331,2:45:52.221
of how he approaches things

2:45:53.420,2:45:58.189
it's a very individual sport that seems

2:45:55.790,2:45:59.899
to attract individualís one of them

2:45:58.189,2:46:02.000
they're really strong characters with a

2:45:59.899,2:46:04.399
bit of an artistic side to their nature

2:46:02.000,2:46:09.199
because they like to see it as what

2:46:04.399,2:46:11.270
they're doing is being very creative is

2:46:09.199,2:46:13.489
it it takes a certain type of person to

2:46:11.270,2:46:23.859
want to jump off a three a 10 metre

2:46:13.489,2:46:27.130
platform until zakharov from the Ukraine

2:46:23.859,2:46:29.390
he's 14

2:46:27.130,2:46:37.449
back two and a half somersault two and a

2:46:29.390,2:46:37.449
half twist very tidy

2:46:38.149,2:46:44.989
it's this consistency been like over the

2:46:40.460,2:46:49.000
evening is that Grove coming in at 14th

2:46:44.989,2:46:51.859
before this dive and he's had a

2:46:49.000,2:46:59.930
near-disastrous 47 to fivers his fifth

2:46:51.859,2:47:02.750
dive at 70s 80s and now 86 for he's got

2:46:59.930,2:47:09.590
away with that that nightmare fifth dive

2:47:02.750,2:47:12.260
hasn't he really competitors who would

2:47:09.590,2:47:15.460
like to have the option of dropping

2:47:12.260,2:47:17.290
their worst dive a lot of their mulligan

2:47:15.460,2:47:20.569
not possible

2:47:17.290,2:47:22.399
Timofey called a chick from belarus down

2:47:20.569,2:47:23.119
in 29th reversed three and a half

2:47:22.399,2:47:27.760
somersault

2:47:23.119,2:47:27.760
he's his farewell dive

2:47:32.060,2:47:40.730
he's just not able to control his

2:47:34.750,2:47:46.670
entries makes a big splash dive after

2:47:40.730,2:47:49.130
dive and that's not even with a poor

2:47:46.670,2:47:51.170
position so he's gotta learn how that's

2:47:49.130,2:47:53.720
done there's a couple of tricks that

2:47:51.170,2:47:56.420
happen under the water and he hasn't

2:47:53.720,2:47:57.950
mastered after finishing tenth in the

2:47:56.420,2:48:01.400
world championships last year I think

2:47:57.950,2:48:04.010
he's going to get into bed tonight and

2:48:01.400,2:48:10.040
think that he's not really done himself

2:48:04.010,2:48:12.050
justice he owned Jewry from Democratic

2:48:10.040,2:48:15.650
People's Republic of Korea the 16 year

2:48:12.050,2:48:25.370
old almost on work experience here

2:48:15.650,2:48:27.170
really down in 32nd place he's finished

2:48:25.370,2:48:30.260
the competition well he's fifth dive was

2:48:27.170,2:48:36.580
one of his best and his last clearly his

2:48:30.260,2:48:40.040
best good you want to see them leave

2:48:36.580,2:48:41.960
feeling good about themselves and we

2:48:40.040,2:48:47.030
mentioned how much on display they are

2:48:41.960,2:48:49.250
and when you're this age and your ego is

2:48:47.030,2:48:51.350
a fragile thing see how they notice one

2:48:49.250,2:48:53.660
aspect of these Olympics that it's the

2:48:51.350,2:48:55.640
the highest level of competition but

2:48:53.660,2:48:57.220
away from that top there is a great

2:48:55.640,2:48:59.660
feeling of support from the crowds to

2:48:57.220,2:49:02.540
two competitors who are young or trying

2:48:59.660,2:49:05.210
to make their mark this is Jimmy Connor

2:49:02.540,2:49:09.080
here at 17 he's right on the bubble at

2:49:05.210,2:49:10.370
18th a lot of people in Australia family

2:49:09.080,2:49:12.800
and friends got their fingers crossed

2:49:10.370,2:49:15.230
for this next dive see if he can make it

2:49:12.800,2:49:17.950
through back two and a half somersault

2:49:15.230,2:49:17.950
one and a half twist

2:49:24.160,2:49:29.870
always done a fairly decent job of it

2:49:26.750,2:49:31.820
too so he's gonna have to be beaten he

2:49:29.870,2:49:34.490
hasn't played himself out of contention

2:49:31.820,2:49:40.340
he's put in a good dive and now the

2:49:34.490,2:49:41.860
cards let them fall how they may and

2:49:40.340,2:49:44.271
this is what you want to see everyone

2:49:41.860,2:49:46.010
putting together a good competition so

2:49:44.271,2:49:48.561
that if you get beaten by a better diver

2:49:46.010,2:49:53.630
that's okay but rather than you not

2:49:48.561,2:49:55.521
giving of your best I think it's the

2:49:53.630,2:49:58.880
drivers who've cut out the disasters who

2:49:55.521,2:50:02.120
will feel that at least they've put on

2:49:58.880,2:50:04.100
some sort of a show 60 7.2 and not with

2:50:02.120,2:50:06.771
a high tariff there so he's not been

2:50:04.100,2:50:11.210
able to get into the 70s and it may be

2:50:06.771,2:50:12.130
enough on those around him how they

2:50:11.210,2:50:15.830
respond

2:50:12.130,2:50:16.190
Martin Wolfram from Germany's had a good

2:50:15.830,2:50:20.690
evening

2:50:16.190,2:50:25.850
up in sixth forward four and a half

2:50:20.690,2:50:28.271
somersault powerful dive at 3.7 the

2:50:25.850,2:50:28.271
tariff

2:50:36.291,2:50:42.989
well he's been tardy all evening and

2:50:38.641,2:50:47.670
he's kept it going to the last and

2:50:42.989,2:50:49.590
something in the 90s here really

2:50:47.670,2:50:52.080
committed himself to that dive along the

2:50:49.590,2:50:54.630
platform didn't he oh he's he's happy

2:50:52.080,2:50:56.640
and justifiably he's improved he had to

2:50:54.630,2:51:00.770
in the 70s then two dives in the 80s

2:50:56.640,2:51:05.370
three in fact and then one in the 90s so

2:51:00.770,2:51:07.590
he's one to watch young Claire egg

2:51:05.370,2:51:10.470
wheeler twelfth back two and a half

2:51:07.590,2:51:13.350
somersault two and a half twist for the

2:51:10.470,2:51:15.710
Cuban age 22 and his second Olympic

2:51:13.350,2:51:15.710
Games

2:51:24.170,2:51:28.641
well that's a busy dive isn't it there's

2:51:26.490,2:51:31.740
a lot going on right there

2:51:28.641,2:51:33.811
three point six degree of difficulty

2:51:31.740,2:51:36.900
two and a half twists two and a half

2:51:33.811,2:51:40.940
somersaults it's just a blur of limbs

2:51:36.900,2:51:40.940
and torso spinning

2:51:44.819,2:51:50.369
well after he reached the semi-final in

2:51:47.669,2:51:57.029
Beijing he will be looking for at least

2:51:50.369,2:51:58.469
that four years on the mind is an

2:51:57.029,2:52:00.809
amazing thing that it can make the body

2:51:58.469,2:52:03.559
do that so quickly eighty four point six

2:52:00.809,2:52:03.559
a guidette

2:52:07.999,2:52:13.829
Alexander bond of became eight from the

2:52:11.849,2:52:16.649
synchro competition remember the 18 year

2:52:13.829,2:52:18.839
old Ukrainian back two and a half

2:52:16.649,2:52:21.059
somersault two and a half twist to

2:52:18.839,2:52:23.869
complete his program and he is in

2:52:21.059,2:52:23.869
seventh place

2:52:26.209,2:52:31.469
well now the solidarity's had up to here

2:52:29.129,2:52:36.859
he's had four good dives and one for one

2:52:31.469,2:52:36.859
and that's closer to good than poor I

2:52:37.819,2:52:42.119
think he'll have his sights set on being

2:52:40.379,2:52:44.309
here tomorrow night not just tomorrow

2:52:42.119,2:52:47.099
morning yes he not quite as clean

2:52:44.309,2:52:49.889
perhaps it's the Chinese with his leg

2:52:47.099,2:52:52.739
form and his the pike position he

2:52:49.889,2:52:59.609
briefly gets into here those knees were

2:52:52.739,2:53:04.969
bent 81 though that three point six

2:52:59.609,2:53:04.969
tariff and he's done enough I'm sure

2:53:07.249,2:53:17.479
ji-ho Park from career in Busan 28 arm

2:53:14.159,2:53:20.729
stand back double somersault 1/2 twists

2:53:17.479,2:53:23.599
and he's got to get up into that arm

2:53:20.729,2:53:23.599
stand position

2:53:32.209,2:53:36.060
it was a real effort getting away from a

2:53:34.560,2:53:38.699
platform wasn't it it was a little

2:53:36.060,2:53:47.640
microphone up there to catch any noises

2:53:38.699,2:53:49.649
coming from the divers and yeah just

2:53:47.640,2:53:54.689
another man gathering experience you

2:53:49.649,2:53:57.209
feel the arm strength needed to get some

2:53:54.689,2:53:59.779
height from that not just fall away into

2:53:57.209,2:54:01.709
the dive just collapse into it the top

2:53:59.779,2:54:03.209
exponents they are really pushing

2:54:01.709,2:54:04.770
pumping themselves away from the

2:54:03.209,2:54:09.119
platform yes he's not the most

2:54:04.770,2:54:15.959
powerfully built of the divers we have

2:54:09.119,2:54:18.090
here Pomona by ov back two and a half

2:54:15.959,2:54:21.270
somersault two and a half twist and he's

2:54:18.090,2:54:27.140
in 17th place with not much room to

2:54:21.270,2:54:27.140
spare 18 remember is the cutoff point

2:54:32.650,2:54:37.480
back two and a half somersault two and a

2:54:34.940,2:54:37.480
half twist

2:54:41.369,2:54:46.569
well if he was in trouble before he's

2:54:43.750,2:54:47.949
not now he for that the world slashed

2:54:46.569,2:54:50.050
here in Shanghai you look at that and

2:54:47.949,2:54:52.119
realize that he's he's got something

2:54:50.050,2:54:54.760
more in him and there it is

2:54:52.119,2:54:57.989
he's delivered and he'll be fine because

2:54:54.760,2:55:01.420
he's got the good score coming here

2:54:57.989,2:55:04.420
current European silver medalist so he's

2:55:01.420,2:55:07.029
a man with expectations to succeed and

2:55:04.420,2:55:08.680
perform when you see a dive like that

2:55:07.029,2:55:11.500
you wonder what what was he doing 17th

2:55:08.680,2:55:15.159
with one dive to come then that doesn't

2:55:11.500,2:55:17.170
help James Conner who's the man on the

2:55:15.159,2:55:20.529
cusp if you like as mini babe

2:55:17.170,2:55:22.920
sort of blows him away he was already in

2:55:20.529,2:55:27.939
front of him but only just

2:55:22.920,2:55:30.399
German sound cares from Mexico in fourth

2:55:27.939,2:55:34.119
place forward four and a half somersault

2:55:30.399,2:55:38.279
to finish up with and he's put down an

2:55:34.119,2:55:38.279
encouraging marker a Mexican

2:55:40.801,2:55:49.351
hmm a little sloppy from him we want to

2:55:46.461,2:55:52.591
put himself in danger though and he's

2:55:49.351,2:55:58.910
too high up the rankings to fall out of

2:55:52.591,2:55:58.910
the top 18 that this one was overdone

2:55:59.601,2:56:06.631
extra fourth rotation takes a little bit

2:56:03.811,2:56:09.471
of pulling out of and they're running

2:56:06.631,2:56:09.471
out of space to do it

2:56:09.711,2:56:12.711
66.6

2:56:14.880,2:56:23.909
secret handshake exchanged and on we go

2:56:19.069,2:56:29.340
Ronnie McCormick from Canada 13th place

2:56:23.909,2:56:33.710
back three and a half somersault didn't

2:56:29.340,2:56:33.710
make the final in Beijing he was 16th

2:56:42.430,2:56:47.021
and another man who I think is now safe

2:56:48.190,2:56:53.930
certainly couldn't afford a major

2:56:50.271,2:56:58.360
mistake sitting 13th but with this dive

2:56:53.930,2:57:01.580
we can count him in nicely executed

2:56:58.360,2:57:04.101
reaches for the water maybe not quite

2:57:01.580,2:57:14.920
vertical but he's got that skill of

2:57:04.101,2:57:19.190
minimizing the splash I'll be alright

2:57:14.920,2:57:21.500
86.4 yeah little sigh of relief there

2:57:19.190,2:57:23.000
I'm sure he must have known in his heart

2:57:21.500,2:57:25.641
he had a cover but he's still in the

2:57:23.000,2:57:30.260
hands of the judges aren't you Matthew

2:57:25.641,2:57:32.391
Mitchum defending champion 10th place

2:57:30.260,2:57:38.811
after 5 dives back two and a half

2:57:32.391,2:57:40.940
somersault two and a half twists well

2:57:38.811,2:57:43.960
it's the Australian going to come up

2:57:40.940,2:57:43.960
with this time

2:57:54.330,2:58:01.061
or one of his better ones and I think

2:57:58.090,2:58:04.900
we've just got another locked into the

2:58:01.061,2:58:06.311
top 18 he looked less than his best

2:58:04.900,2:58:11.530
early in the competition but he's

2:58:06.311,2:58:13.180
starting to find form he might tell us

2:58:11.530,2:58:18.430
later that he always had it under

2:58:13.180,2:58:21.220
control and he looked safely through the

2:58:18.430,2:58:23.561
Beijing champ I think he is the sort of

2:58:21.220,2:58:24.790
highly experienced competitor who knows

2:58:23.561,2:58:27.370
that he's just got to get himself

2:58:24.790,2:58:31.840
through this you know and it's not being

2:58:27.370,2:58:34.271
won tonight he's that's been a tad

2:58:31.840,2:58:37.120
unpredictable hmm eighty four point six

2:58:34.271,2:58:40.540
though we'll see him safely across the

2:58:37.120,2:58:44.200
line and into morning competition I'm

2:58:40.540,2:58:46.870
wound against my Vic from Norway

2:58:44.200,2:58:55.699
down in 24 finishes with an inward three

2:58:46.870,2:58:57.879
and a half somersault tucked very nice

2:58:55.699,2:59:01.569
he's

2:58:57.879,2:59:08.050
had a couple of good dives and a few not

2:59:01.569,2:59:11.919
really olympic-class but I like what

2:59:08.050,2:59:15.489
he's offered here at the end he's

2:59:11.919,2:59:20.100
pulling some good scores for it - maybe

2:59:15.489,2:59:20.100
just came in a little nervous at 21 and

2:59:21.390,2:59:25.270
so pretty good on the one meter

2:59:23.439,2:59:33.879
springboard so he's got a range of

2:59:25.270,2:59:38.039
skills across the disciplines him up now

2:59:33.879,2:59:41.319
with Francesco ill whoa mo from Italy

2:59:38.039,2:59:42.930
arm stand forward double somersault with

2:59:41.319,2:59:47.829
one twist

2:59:42.930,2:59:50.680
she's only worth three point one he's in

2:59:47.829,2:59:52.979
26th place just getting himself up into

2:59:50.680,2:59:52.979
that position

2:59:57.920,3:00:03.660
no it'sit's such a disappointing thing

3:00:01.471,3:00:06.750
because he's first three dives were so

3:00:03.660,3:00:10.530
good and now pardon the obvious panties

3:00:06.750,3:00:13.261
plummeted out of contention with just a

3:00:10.530,3:00:15.811
drop off in form that maybe comes from

3:00:13.261,3:00:18.690
confidence that the fourth dive was was

3:00:15.811,3:00:21.360
poor so was the fifth the sixth he had

3:00:18.690,3:00:28.410
little chance by this stage he was

3:00:21.360,3:00:30.000
almost dropping into that dive there the

3:00:28.410,3:00:31.681
top divers have really snapped

3:00:30.000,3:00:35.521
themselves still out of that arm stand

3:00:31.681,3:00:38.181
position sixty point four five four

3:00:35.521,3:00:38.181
Francesco

3:00:38.330,3:00:44.670
Christopher s Gilson from Sweden he's

3:00:42.000,3:00:46.971
27th forward four and a half somersault

3:00:44.670,3:00:46.971
to end

3:00:54.439,3:01:00.239
didn't quite reach that desired position

3:00:57.960,3:01:05.640
for the entry that's such a lot of some

3:01:00.239,3:01:09.000
ourselves to get through four and a half

3:01:05.640,3:01:13.080
of them 3.8 sees most difficult dive he

3:01:09.000,3:01:16.020
saves it neurologically for last but I'm

3:01:13.080,3:01:17.159
at I just wonder too if there isn't an

3:01:16.020,3:01:18.689
argument for putting them in a little

3:01:17.159,3:01:23.100
earlier when you know the competition's

3:01:18.689,3:01:25.199
gonna go for three hours plus rather

3:01:23.100,3:01:28.350
than trying to rely on keeping your

3:01:25.199,3:01:30.470
concentration and form and confidence

3:01:28.350,3:01:33.470
going over what amounts to a three hour

3:01:30.470,3:01:33.470
competition

3:01:38.239,3:01:48.800
Erik Sain from Canada now in 30th

3:01:43.170,3:01:51.000
position not had the best of nights in

3:01:48.800,3:01:53.420
verse three and a half somersault to

3:01:51.000,3:01:53.420
finish off

3:01:59.501,3:02:06.051
not a lot of elevation off the platform

3:02:02.331,3:02:07.911
is to rip through these somersaults but

3:02:06.051,3:02:10.940
does it does a good job really by the

3:02:07.911,3:02:13.190
time he reaches the water he's got it

3:02:10.940,3:02:14.690
under control and all that camera angle

3:02:13.190,3:02:18.201
is just frightening isn't it when you

3:02:14.690,3:02:19.461
see how close the head goes maybe it's a

3:02:18.201,3:02:21.831
bit like the view from the passenger

3:02:19.461,3:02:23.241
seat sometimes when it's it looks worse

3:02:21.831,3:02:26.961
from there than it does with you or the

3:02:23.241,3:02:28.761
actual driver but you shudder at the

3:02:26.961,3:02:30.411
thought if they just catch themselves we

3:02:28.761,3:02:33.070
wouldn't be the first at all but no

3:02:30.411,3:02:33.070
wonder they get injured

3:02:33.940,3:02:43.761
Brian Lomas back two and a half

3:02:38.150,3:02:50.751
somersault two and a half twist xx cam

3:02:43.761,3:02:52.341
he may be oh this is what this is one

3:02:50.751,3:02:54.261
for the calculator and the judge is it

3:02:52.341,3:02:56.241
and we'll wait for the tabulation to be

3:02:54.261,3:03:00.221
done at the end but he I think he's

3:02:56.241,3:03:11.421
improved his position here a little

3:03:00.221,3:03:14.480
that's a good dive from Brian so four

3:03:11.421,3:03:19.221
eights two of them rejected but eight

3:03:14.480,3:03:21.230
and a seven and a half and an eighty

3:03:19.221,3:03:23.751
four point six is that that's a much

3:03:21.230,3:03:27.261
bigger score and James Connor God for

3:03:23.751,3:03:30.921
his last dive he has dived in World

3:03:27.261,3:03:35.301
Championship finals so he will have come

3:03:30.921,3:03:37.461
in here hoping even Garcia of Mexico

3:03:35.301,3:03:40.221
fifth ranked forward two and a half

3:03:37.461,3:03:43.241
somersault three twists and he's had an

3:03:40.221,3:03:43.241
encouraging evening

3:03:47.290,3:03:53.750
didn't need his dive in this last series

3:03:51.080,3:03:56.650
to be anything too special and well

3:03:53.750,3:04:01.641
frankly it wasn't but he's got a lot of

3:03:56.650,3:04:05.330
room to play with the synchro silver

3:04:01.641,3:04:08.631
medalist remember and he might be one of

3:04:05.330,3:04:11.480
those divers who's looking to continue

3:04:08.631,3:04:14.420
to improve throughout the competition

3:04:11.480,3:04:17.660
and maybe mounter a metal challenge if

3:04:14.420,3:04:19.311
others don't deliver of their best the

3:04:17.660,3:04:27.141
high tariffs fear helping boost a score

3:04:19.311,3:04:28.851
to seventy nine point eight now Nick

3:04:27.141,3:04:32.000
McCrory back two and a half somersault

3:04:28.851,3:04:34.370
two and a half twists in eighth pretty

3:04:32.000,3:04:38.061
comfortable three point six the tariff

3:04:34.370,3:04:43.690
we just want to sign off nice and clean

3:04:38.061,3:04:43.690
and then head off for a night's rest

3:04:48.591,3:04:55.021
yeah that'll give him some confidence no

3:04:52.110,3:04:57.780
nightmares with his last dive now he's a

3:04:55.021,3:05:08.580
world top ten dry diver six that world's

3:04:57.780,3:05:13.530
last year clean nice entry tour man at

3:05:08.580,3:05:15.420
180 centimeters or 511 so there's a bit

3:05:13.530,3:05:17.490
more of him to get around and a bit more

3:05:15.420,3:05:19.370
of him to make a splash but he's got it

3:05:17.490,3:05:22.561
all under control

3:05:19.370,3:05:25.370
job darling general terms tonight for

3:05:22.561,3:05:25.370
Nick

3:05:29.511,3:05:41.101
good job as American coaches like to say

3:05:32.250,3:05:42.601
I think good job as a Garrett xxi back

3:05:41.101,3:05:45.780
to an off somersault two and a half

3:05:42.601,3:05:53.420
twists three point six needs to pull out

3:05:45.780,3:05:56.750
a bit of a blinder here which he does

3:05:53.420,3:06:05.070
give it himself an outside chance here

3:05:56.750,3:06:10.170
as they gear up Santiago de Cuba the

3:06:05.070,3:06:14.851
veteran in the field at 33 competed in

3:06:10.170,3:06:16.170
five World Championships a couple of

3:06:14.851,3:06:19.980
eight and a half's and a nine are gonna

3:06:16.170,3:06:23.700
count here for a big last effort of

3:06:19.980,3:06:32.521
ninety three point six and he's up to

3:06:23.700,3:06:38.070
16th mat for 33 year old Sebastian via

3:06:32.521,3:06:39.181
now from Colombia 22nd position finishes

3:06:38.070,3:06:41.690
with the reverse three and a half

3:06:39.181,3:06:41.690
somersault

3:06:47.800,3:06:52.260
he needs some really strong marks here

3:06:54.450,3:07:00.460
pulls it around it's the effort of

3:06:58.930,3:07:05.760
straightening up there left him bent at

3:07:00.460,3:07:05.760
the hips a little is too flexible

3:07:10.939,3:07:22.610
and so completes on one meter and

3:07:12.710,3:07:27.950
3-meter springboard up now to David who

3:07:22.610,3:07:29.420
died of a synchro bronze medalist from

3:07:27.950,3:07:30.740
what must seem like a long time ago

3:07:29.420,3:07:36.020
their bidding of last week

3:07:30.740,3:07:38.330
he's eleventh back two and a half

3:07:36.020,3:07:42.020
somersault two and a half twists to

3:07:38.330,3:07:44.360
complete his evenings work is such a

3:07:42.020,3:07:47.990
range of body types competing in this

3:07:44.360,3:07:49.880
platform event he's a big strong man

3:07:47.990,3:07:52.330
bear powerful shoulders the shoulders of

3:07:49.880,3:07:52.330
a gymnast

3:07:52.420,3:07:58.390
that's a splash he went may be pleased

3:07:55.850,3:07:58.390
you didn't see

3:07:58.471,3:08:04.141
he did start as a gymnast actually broke

3:08:01.440,3:08:07.280
a bone in his foot and felt that it was

3:08:04.141,3:08:10.171
just a bit burned out my gymnastics Oh

3:08:07.280,3:08:12.381
decided diving off ten meters was a more

3:08:10.171,3:08:14.910
comfortable way to go takes all sorts

3:08:12.381,3:08:18.030
that's a very demanding sport to stick

3:08:14.910,3:08:22.250
with David Boudia 17th position and

3:08:18.030,3:08:22.250
things looking shaky for James Conner

3:08:23.750,3:08:32.040
you'll be able to bring you the final 18

3:08:27.200,3:08:33.780
shortly chuubo the 19 year old the

3:08:32.040,3:08:37.431
favorite from chummy left back two and a

3:08:33.780,3:08:37.431
half somersault two and a half twist I

3:08:42.021,3:08:46.710
was just looking at this even mayic

3:08:44.280,3:08:48.960
actually need to do that last dive so

3:08:46.710,3:08:54.750
far a hit without doing it he would have

3:08:48.960,3:08:57.210
qualified in the top ten great thrust

3:08:54.750,3:09:04.891
away from the platform into his twists

3:08:57.210,3:09:07.710
and again what an entry in this form he

3:09:04.891,3:09:09.030
looks untouchable his arm movements

3:09:07.710,3:09:11.221
through that he's in one position for

3:09:09.030,3:09:14.101
the twist and down back behind to hold

3:09:11.221,3:09:16.290
up the pike and then out so much going

3:09:14.101,3:09:20.750
on as you've said before in so many

3:09:16.290,3:09:28.790
different parts of his body and in 97 -

3:09:20.750,3:09:32.341
he's at 299 s Sasha Klein from Germany

3:09:28.790,3:09:35.040
third after five dives back to a half

3:09:32.341,3:09:38.240
somersault two and a half twists again

3:09:35.040,3:09:38.240
looking to leave on a high

3:09:40.810,3:09:46.670
it wasn't his best dive there very

3:09:45.350,3:09:48.560
tempting to switch off when you're in

3:09:46.670,3:09:53.659
his position he's so firmly entrenched

3:09:48.560,3:09:58.460
in the top getting late local time did

3:09:53.659,3:10:02.390
after a 10:00 in the evening three hours

3:09:58.460,3:10:04.399
of competition tough on divers ever

3:10:02.390,3:10:08.090
thought for the judges as well that's a

3:10:04.399,3:10:09.560
lot of concentration going on my my real

3:10:08.090,3:10:12.109
sympathy though is with the competitors

3:10:09.560,3:10:14.300
because it's not easy to finish a

3:10:12.109,3:10:15.979
competition go back to the village and

3:10:14.300,3:10:17.859
get yourself to sleep within a couple of

3:10:15.979,3:10:19.939
hours of competing because you pumped

3:10:17.859,3:10:21.939
they've got a refuel they'll need to

3:10:19.939,3:10:23.539
take the right things on board and I

3:10:21.939,3:10:25.909
need some rest

3:10:23.539,3:10:29.829
I think the shed your links crazy I'm

3:10:25.909,3:10:34.130
just amazed about the short turnaround

3:10:29.829,3:10:36.800
I'd even cap tour from Belarus 19th just

3:10:34.130,3:10:42.399
on the outside looking in Reverse four

3:10:36.800,3:10:44.899
and a half somersault to save it I mean

3:10:42.399,3:10:46.699
if we finish work at five o'clock in the

3:10:44.899,3:10:49.569
afternoon we're not expected to be back

3:10:46.699,3:10:49.569
at work at five in the morning

3:10:50.600,3:11:00.379
and that's the Askia kept to it finishes

3:10:55.699,3:11:00.979
his evenings work now Tom Daly is up

3:11:00.379,3:11:03.890
next

3:11:00.979,3:11:07.999
that's why you can hear the crowds

3:11:03.890,3:11:09.949
it's just confirmed cap to us mark 64 35

3:11:07.999,3:11:12.919
and he can have a bit of a lie-in

3:11:09.949,3:11:14.419
tomorrow and it's not like they just

3:11:12.919,3:11:17.029
turn up at 10 o'clock in the morning

3:11:14.419,3:11:20.600
either they hear early to warm up here's

3:11:17.029,3:11:24.079
a big moment though massive cheer tal

3:11:20.600,3:11:28.100
afford to have another disaster 16th

3:11:24.079,3:11:32.779
after round 5 and really we've had all

3:11:28.100,3:11:36.409
sorts so far you can hear the feel the

3:11:32.779,3:11:41.899
crowd just willing one more strong dive

3:11:36.409,3:11:45.020
from their local hero there you go well

3:11:41.899,3:11:46.489
maybe I thought it'd have been early

3:11:45.020,3:11:50.600
because he's flipped the feet over but

3:11:46.489,3:11:53.689
the crowd certainly had their say he's

3:11:50.600,3:11:56.949
got just a bit to play with with the top

3:11:53.689,3:12:02.089
18 going through and he was sitting 16

3:11:56.949,3:12:07.729
they are willing him on he's everybody's

3:12:02.089,3:12:10.069
favorite son and they will all just love

3:12:07.729,3:12:12.829
him to do well it really is a sir it is

3:12:10.069,3:12:15.379
a supportive sound I feel not just a

3:12:12.829,3:12:15.949
pressure if he can see it like that he's

3:12:15.379,3:12:19.520
gonna make it

3:12:15.949,3:12:21.619
he's through ranked 15 and there's three

3:12:19.520,3:12:25.640
to come and we know a couple of them are

3:12:21.619,3:12:29.479
no chance so he is in to the semi-final

3:12:25.640,3:12:31.189
Thomas Daly maybe not quite the way he

3:12:29.479,3:12:33.680
was looking that will of course affect

3:12:31.189,3:12:34.899
his dive position tomorrow in the

3:12:33.680,3:12:39.140
batting order

3:12:34.899,3:12:40.180
Andreea Kiana beanie who's pretty out of

3:12:39.140,3:12:42.470
it

3:12:40.180,3:12:46.189
two and a half somersault one and a half

3:12:42.470,3:12:49.159
twists to end up what's not being his

3:12:46.189,3:12:52.159
greatest night but at 17 a key learning

3:12:49.159,3:12:54.050
experience in his sporting career and he

3:12:52.159,3:12:57.400
has finished off nicely here Roger this

3:12:54.050,3:12:59.230
is one of his better dives pressures off

3:12:57.400,3:13:03.190
that sometimes has a bit to do with it

3:12:59.230,3:13:07.601
when you know you can't progress the

3:13:03.190,3:13:13.960
weight comes off the shoulders nicely

3:13:07.601,3:13:16.570
done 75.2 so he's got it in him he'll be

3:13:13.960,3:13:21.101
back he stick salad and it keeps the

3:13:16.570,3:13:27.940
appetite and fancies a trip to Rio and

3:13:21.101,3:13:32.851
who wouldn't who go Parisi who knows all

3:13:27.940,3:13:32.851
about Rio where he is from Brasilia

3:13:39.420,3:13:47.070
25th back to 1/2 somersault two and a

3:13:44.650,3:13:47.070
half twist

3:13:51.351,3:13:56.931
and again has to bend at the hips and

3:13:54.471,3:13:59.721
that spoils the entry and creates that

3:13:56.931,3:14:01.130
big splash so Parisi not quite there

3:13:59.721,3:14:06.170
finishing towards the bottom of the

3:14:01.130,3:14:09.320
field some kind of a miracle needed for

3:14:06.170,3:14:11.330
the last dive for our last man making

3:14:09.320,3:14:12.110
sure the competition comes to a dramatic

3:14:11.330,3:14:14.420
conclusion

3:14:12.110,3:14:19.360
Peter walk field of Great Britain

3:14:14.420,3:14:23.601
massive cheer but he has got work to do

3:14:19.360,3:14:26.240
23rd he's got an Olympic silver medal

3:14:23.601,3:14:28.761
remember in synchro and he needs to draw

3:14:26.240,3:14:31.940
on all that experience and all that

3:14:28.761,3:14:35.450
talent now to be back tomorrow morning

3:14:31.940,3:14:42.320
big moment for a local lad born just

3:14:35.450,3:14:44.570
down the road just a little short and

3:14:42.320,3:14:49.280
punchy the water underneath the surface

3:14:44.570,3:14:55.020
and I don't know if it's enough he needs

3:14:49.280,3:14:58.169
around 440 in total

3:14:55.020,3:14:58.169
[Music]

3:14:59.101,3:15:07.370
he's been such a storming influence in

3:15:02.670,3:15:07.370
British diving for more than a decade

3:15:07.400,3:15:15.141
competing at World Championships right

3:15:09.721,3:15:19.440
back in 1997 but this may well prove a

3:15:15.141,3:15:22.021
trip too far and 23rd is his ranking he

3:15:19.440,3:15:26.730
couldn't pull the enormous score that he

3:15:22.021,3:15:29.011
needed and so but Dyer is the last man

3:15:26.730,3:15:31.580
in or that would have been quite a

3:15:29.011,3:15:34.110
sensation if he'd missed it's the

3:15:31.580,3:15:36.630
ranking the two chinese divers setting

3:15:34.110,3:15:38.851
the standard sasha Klein and Martin

3:15:36.630,3:15:39.980
Wolfram a good night for Germany and for

3:15:38.851,3:15:42.660
Mexico

3:15:39.980,3:15:44.221
Alexandre bond or Nick McCrory from

3:15:42.660,3:15:46.710
Ukraine and the United States

3:15:44.221,3:15:48.561
respectively Matthew Mitchum more to

3:15:46.710,3:15:52.230
come from him

golfer in fading rather but showing he's

3:15:58.440,3:16:01.910
got ability these marks will not count

3:16:00.420,3:16:03.450
tomorrow they start again from scratch

3:16:01.910,3:16:07.230
David Boudia

3:16:03.450,3:16:09.601
Jose Guerra and Brian Lomas and Jimmy

3:16:07.230,3:16:13.200
Connor the two most disappointed men

3:16:09.601,3:16:18.721
really they just miss the cut they are

3:16:13.200,3:16:21.090
on standby I think but these divers can

3:16:18.721,3:16:24.650
just put it down to a massive Olympic

3:16:21.090,3:16:27.450
experience a long line of competition

3:16:24.650,3:16:29.730
here but I've got a feeling overall

3:16:27.450,3:16:32.370
Steve that it is an appetizer and the

3:16:29.730,3:16:34.681
top men although we've seen some

3:16:32.370,3:16:37.710
outstanding performances at the top end

3:16:34.681,3:16:40.021
are really just warming up and getting

3:16:37.710,3:16:41.700
into their stride I just felt the turbo

3:16:40.021,3:16:43.290
didn't have to dive as well as he did

3:16:41.700,3:16:46.320
but he's in doing so he's made a

3:16:43.290,3:16:50.971
statement he's some 31 points clear of

3:16:46.320,3:16:55.500
linear and then back to Klein so 563 for

3:16:50.971,3:16:58.740
Schubert go back to third 525 and that

3:16:55.500,3:17:00.891
is a massive amount to make up and there

3:16:58.740,3:17:04.650
were no weaknesses in turbos performance

3:17:00.891,3:17:07.530
so he looks good for the gold and for

3:17:04.650,3:17:10.141
China to continue their dominance he has

3:17:07.530,3:17:12.900
been beaten before to bow Tom Daley

3:17:10.141,3:17:15.121
famously did it in 2009

3:17:12.900,3:17:17.851
when the pressure did get to him but

3:17:15.121,3:17:21.171
he's a more experienced diver now and it

3:17:17.851,3:17:25.261
is that ability to just churn out these

3:17:21.171,3:17:26.851
top top-quality dives he's not yet

3:17:25.261,3:17:29.280
dazzled but I don't think he's been

3:17:26.851,3:17:32.190
under the pressure to really do

3:17:29.280,3:17:37.261
everything he can do he knows he's got

3:17:32.190,3:17:38.190
plenty spare but a great appetizer this

3:17:37.261,3:17:40.291
is a great event

3:17:38.190,3:17:42.150
and we're looking forward to just seeing

3:17:40.291,3:17:43.921
more great dives we don't care who they

3:17:42.150,3:17:46.110
come from because we're being richly

3:17:43.921,3:17:49.860
entertained here at the Aquatic Center

3:17:46.110,3:17:52.860
and it's dramatic stuff off the platform

3:17:49.860,3:17:54.961
and the wonderful skills and courage

3:17:52.860,3:17:58.171
that we're observing and we're looking

3:17:54.961,3:18:00.480
forward to more of it I think the divers

3:17:58.171,3:18:03.211
would go away some with encouragement

3:18:00.480,3:18:06.030
some knowing that I've got something to

3:18:03.211,3:18:08.461
learn from it some tonight knowing that

3:18:06.030,3:18:10.171
after all that build-up and all that

3:18:08.461,3:18:12.900
work it's been a bitterly disappointing

3:18:10.171,3:18:18.411
evening for them but at the top end

3:18:12.900,3:18:21.961
though we really have seen some quality

3:18:18.411,3:18:26.311
couvreux is a sight to behold when he's

3:18:21.961,3:18:30.061
in top form I still got a job to do

3:18:26.311,3:18:31.911
tomorrow twice over and we're looking

3:18:30.061,3:18:35.011
forward to bringing that to you

3:18:31.911,3:18:37.891
something quite exciting a very

3:18:35.011,3:18:39.690
difficult night ahead then for 18 divers

3:18:37.891,3:18:41.581
to get their rest get themselves

3:18:39.690,3:18:44.240
mentally prepared and be back at 10

3:18:41.581,3:18:44.240
o'clock tomorrow morning

3:20:38.610,3:20:45.269
