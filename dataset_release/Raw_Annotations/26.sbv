and for the final time good evening and

0:03:15.540,0:03:19.379
welcome to Edinburgh

0:03:16.950,0:03:26.160
hosting the diving events at the Glasgow

0:03:19.379,0:03:28.019
2014 20th Commonwealth Games big wave it

0:03:26.160,0:03:29.580
must cost a bit scary but everyone seems

0:03:28.019,0:03:34.500
to like it so maybe I'm out of kilter on

0:03:29.580,0:03:37.110
this up as we prepare for two more

0:03:34.500,0:03:40.170
finals the two last finals of the week

0:03:37.110,0:03:41.849
at the Royal Conwell pool I'm actually

0:03:40.170,0:03:43.829
by the time we get underway so if I time

0:03:41.849,0:03:45.420
we get to the 10-meter later all the

0:03:43.829,0:03:48.480
seats will be taken there will be a

0:03:45.420,0:03:52.590
raucous atmosphere in here then Jesus

0:03:48.480,0:03:56.160
fought three Englishmen in the men's

0:03:52.590,0:03:59.099
10-meter three English women and one

0:03:56.160,0:04:02.940
Scots woman in the 3-meter springboard

0:03:59.099,0:04:05.970
to come up next in their interesting

0:04:02.940,0:04:07.340
week always gone to plan not always gone

0:04:05.970,0:04:10.260
to the script

0:04:07.340,0:04:12.540
but we have 12 to go in the women's

0:04:10.260,0:04:15.209
3-meter springboard final we have 11 to

0:04:12.540,0:04:18.209
go in the men's 10 metre platform final

0:04:15.209,0:04:21.120
alongside me as ever to cast his eye and

0:04:18.209,0:04:22.979
give us the intricacies of every dive

0:04:21.120,0:04:27.330
and whether it's good bad or indifferent

0:04:22.979,0:04:30.800
is the happens 2004 10 metre platform

0:04:27.330,0:04:32.910
with synchro silver medalist Leon Taylor

0:04:30.800,0:04:34.500
at this point I always ask you that

0:04:32.910,0:04:37.250
rather inane question would you do with

0:04:34.500,0:04:40.380
so brilliantly what are you expecting

0:04:37.250,0:04:43.910
well I'm expecting some diving and I

0:04:40.380,0:04:45.780
would like to see some high-class

0:04:43.910,0:04:46.470
world-class diving here at the

0:04:45.780,0:04:49.590
Commonwealth Games

0:04:46.470,0:04:52.800
we saw where as we usually see in the

0:04:49.590,0:04:55.110
prelims we see a mixed bag and some

0:04:52.800,0:04:57.539
athletes on their game others still to

0:04:55.110,0:05:00.539
find theirs and of course quite a spread

0:04:57.539,0:05:02.559
through the marks there we are the

0:05:00.539,0:05:06.309
crowds warming up and

0:05:02.559,0:05:09.219
grace weed going in the women's 3 meter

0:05:06.309,0:05:10.749
final she dives in number 3 just 18

0:05:09.219,0:05:13.599
years old her second Commonwealth Games

0:05:10.749,0:05:16.509
and when she takes to the board the

0:05:13.599,0:05:17.889
crowd certainly show their support the

0:05:16.509,0:05:19.659
atmosphere is great you can see the

0:05:17.889,0:05:21.489
shots of the well that essentially the

0:05:19.659,0:05:22.629
diving board and that is the board that

0:05:21.489,0:05:24.279
they're going to be diving up that's a

0:05:22.629,0:05:29.289
close up at the end of the 3-meter

0:05:24.279,0:05:32.289
springboard it's yeah complicated

0:05:29.289,0:05:35.679
technical any timing coordination

0:05:32.289,0:05:37.749
strength power agility and that's just

0:05:35.679,0:05:39.219
to do the very basic of dives and as

0:05:37.749,0:05:42.339
we've seen over the last couple of days

0:05:39.219,0:05:43.539
a decent hurdle step helps yeah heard of

0:05:42.339,0:05:46.659
step is the approach to the end of the

0:05:43.539,0:05:48.339
diving board on some of the dives so a

0:05:46.659,0:05:50.229
forward and the reverse normally need a

0:05:48.339,0:05:51.609
hurdle step that's where you walk down

0:05:50.229,0:05:53.409
the diving board she pushed the diving

0:05:51.609,0:05:55.509
board down with one foot and then you

0:05:53.409,0:05:57.159
leap onto the end of the diving board

0:05:55.509,0:05:59.559
not over the end but the end of the

0:05:57.159,0:06:02.799
diving board ideally with two feet

0:05:59.559,0:06:05.529
usually the best shot best shot at

0:06:02.799,0:06:07.329
performing of the dive and what we're

0:06:05.529,0:06:10.389
going to be seeing is five dives

0:06:07.329,0:06:12.610
performed by each of the ladies five

0:06:10.389,0:06:15.999
different groups of dives and here is

0:06:12.610,0:06:17.919
the start list so Chum will go first the

0:06:15.999,0:06:19.979
first of the English divers Rebecca

0:06:17.919,0:06:22.119
Gallen tree up second think grace Reed

0:06:19.979,0:06:25.479
for a huge cheer when they come out on

0:06:22.119,0:06:28.959
pool deck for her yes you will get a

0:06:25.479,0:06:31.929
massive reception and last to go looking

0:06:28.959,0:06:34.899
for a notable double here after winning

0:06:31.929,0:06:37.180
the 1 meter Jennifer Abel watch out for

0:06:34.899,0:06:39.820
mass and Keaney has a chin

0:06:37.180,0:06:42.280
more medals for Australia best placed

0:06:39.820,0:06:48.460
after the prelims of the English divers

0:06:42.280,0:06:50.590
was Hannah Starling precursor to what's

0:06:48.460,0:06:55.630
going to happen later with the 10-meter

0:06:50.590,0:06:58.500
platform which was force leon's events

0:06:55.630,0:07:02.710
they've been to Italy and synchro wise

0:06:58.500,0:07:04.539
and on paper it's very easy to say well

0:07:02.710,0:07:07.120
it's Tom Daley against Matthew Mitchell

0:07:04.539,0:07:09.160
isn't it the Olympic bronze medalist of

0:07:07.120,0:07:13.630
2012 against the Olympic gold medalist

0:07:09.160,0:07:15.639
of 2008 bit more to it than that yeah

0:07:13.630,0:07:17.680
maybe I still think he's going to be a

0:07:15.639,0:07:19.780
head head though so yeah there will be a

0:07:17.680,0:07:24.180
fight for the bronze I'm sure but I'm

0:07:19.780,0:07:24.180
yeah I'm gonna tip yeah we've got some

0:07:24.770,0:07:29.940
v8 VIPs in the crowd tonight as you can

0:07:27.870,0:07:33.060
see welcome one and all these were the

0:07:29.940,0:07:33.960
golden tickets sold out within a matter

0:07:33.060,0:07:35.790
of minutes

0:07:33.960,0:07:37.620
I think because of the number of seats

0:07:35.790,0:07:40.320
still many people to take their seats

0:07:37.620,0:07:42.510
but it is very very warm I can assure

0:07:40.320,0:07:45.720
you I'm sitting here on my shorts and my

0:07:42.510,0:07:48.180
flip-flops and I'm still very warm pick

up the girls that you don't need for the

0:07:48.180,0:07:55.350

0:09:29.960,0:09:36.650
get to the 10-meter platform almost

0:09:32.960,0:09:40.100
immediately afterwards and Jennifer ball

0:10:14.450,0:10:19.640
political parties in tonight as well

0:10:16.600,0:10:20.960
it's the hottest ticket in town even

0:10:19.640,0:10:22.580
hotter than some of the Edinburgh

0:10:20.960,0:10:25.040
Festival tickets which is just getting

0:10:22.580,0:10:26.510
underway in the city goes on right the

0:10:25.040,0:10:28.670
way through until the end to town so

0:10:26.510,0:10:33.110
it's move an overlap beer come while

0:10:28.670,0:10:35.840
diving and the Edra festival which might

0:10:33.110,0:10:38.590
be why the pubs and bars were rather

0:10:35.840,0:10:38.590
busy last night

0:10:47.020,0:10:52.250
[Applause]

0:10:49.730,0:10:54.600
[Music]

0:10:52.250,0:11:03.760
[Applause]

0:10:54.600,0:11:06.820
helping John each thank you very much

0:11:03.760,0:11:10.810
indeed as we introduce the judges for

0:11:06.820,0:11:15.880
the women's 3-meter springboard and here

0:11:10.810,0:11:20.970
they are and Elysium our would come with

0:11:15.880,0:11:24.300
Chong Valerie pedo Marco for that so and

0:11:20.970,0:11:29.830
probably boys the former Canadian diver

0:11:24.300,0:11:33.370
now judge will go number six the fate of

0:11:29.830,0:11:35.950
the twelve divers to come it's very much

0:11:33.370,0:11:38.230
in their hands see how they interpret

0:11:35.950,0:11:39.640
the dimes we'll have five rounds of

0:11:38.230,0:11:43.510
dives there'll be a lot of similar ones

0:11:39.640,0:11:44.470
like for example Shawn Jonas Young who

0:11:43.510,0:11:46.570
goes first

0:11:44.470,0:11:49.180
will do the inward two-and-a-half

0:11:46.570,0:11:50.890
somersaults dive will also be performed

0:11:49.180,0:11:54.240
a slightly different way by grace Reed

0:11:50.890,0:11:58.019
and then by Annabel Smith

0:11:54.240,0:12:01.019
temperature Sabri and yang ye and a

0:11:58.019,0:12:04.290
starling esta chin and Jennifer Abel so

0:12:01.019,0:12:07.740
pretty much half or more than half all

0:12:04.290,0:12:10.920
the divers will go for in technical temp

0:12:07.740,0:12:12.600
school of 405 B translates into an

0:12:10.920,0:12:17.519
inward two and a half somersault so they

0:12:12.600,0:12:21.059
go in reverse order so 12 place finish

0:12:17.519,0:12:23.579
goes first the best of the morning will

0:12:21.059,0:12:27.720
go last and that's Jennifer a board

0:12:23.579,0:12:32.009
who's going for a notable double here so

0:12:27.720,0:12:34.589
the advantage of diving last is that the

0:12:32.009,0:12:36.059
judges tend to expect the best dives to

0:12:34.589,0:12:37.679
come at the last bit of the round

0:12:36.059,0:12:39.689
because you were the winner of the

0:12:37.679,0:12:41.279
delivery so the momentum of the

0:12:39.689,0:12:43.920
competition can often carry the higher

0:12:41.279,0:12:45.360
marks being awarded to the divers at the

0:12:43.920,0:12:47.269
back end of the field but it doesn't

0:12:45.360,0:12:51.769
always go that way but sometimes it does

0:12:47.269,0:12:54.119
here we go competition is underway

0:12:51.769,0:12:56.660
referee's whistle blowing so we have our

0:12:54.119,0:12:59.850
first diver on the board highest Yong

0:12:56.660,0:13:02.689
jun-hyung of Malaysia with an A with two

0:12:59.850,0:13:02.689
and a half so a source

0:13:04.600,0:13:08.300
well Cheung would have been looking for

0:13:06.920,0:13:11.089
a stronger star than that leaving the

0:13:08.300,0:13:13.309
dive short of vertical takeoff looked

0:13:11.089,0:13:14.779
okay it's a difficult dive to do so you

0:13:13.309,0:13:16.639
need to squeeze into that pipe shake

0:13:14.779,0:13:18.019
which he does just let it go her legs a

0:13:16.639,0:13:20.660
little bit too early

0:13:18.019,0:13:23.749
leaving the dive marginally short of

0:13:20.660,0:13:26.360
verticals let's see what she gets if

0:13:23.749,0:13:28.009
you're looking for sevens really and 6.5

0:13:26.360,0:13:30.619
is what she gets so kind of mid-range

0:13:28.009,0:13:32.899
really seven and above very good six

0:13:30.619,0:13:35.089
half and below not quite so good against

0:13:32.899,0:13:36.769
six and a half since six is twenty not

0:13:35.089,0:13:41.300
doing challenging for the upper echelon

0:13:36.769,0:13:46.309
of this event we took it down to be much

0:13:41.300,0:13:48.199
further down quality normally shows that

0:13:46.309,0:13:49.879
was the morning that could be parked and

0:13:48.199,0:13:52.519
will start all over again with a forward

0:13:49.879,0:14:00.050
two and a half seven sorts one twist for

0:13:52.519,0:14:01.910
Rebecca to roll over as she goes into

0:14:00.050,0:14:03.499
the water she's back from the end on the

0:14:01.910,0:14:05.749
take-off which means yes to shift her

0:14:03.499,0:14:08.870
weight forward in order to complete the

0:14:05.749,0:14:13.819
dive and that affects the entry so she

0:14:08.870,0:14:16.910
rolls over vertical only scoffs I think

0:14:13.819,0:14:20.029
bother than eight which would have been

0:14:16.910,0:14:24.559
ideal opening yeah

0:14:20.029,0:14:28.850
57 it is six Justin white gets the seven

0:14:24.559,0:14:31.310
she wanted or above six and to 6.5 takes

0:14:28.850,0:14:37.279
a second for typing it's

0:14:31.310,0:14:38.779
- great grace grace read on the board

0:14:37.279,0:14:41.840
now she's doing a slightly different

0:14:38.779,0:14:43.550
version of the in with two and a half

0:14:41.840,0:14:46.550
somersaults this one were tuck not with

0:14:43.550,0:14:50.510
pike consequently it's not worth three

0:14:46.550,0:14:52.790
point zero it's worth 2.7 it's kind of

0:14:50.510,0:14:57.620
where her program to take she is at the

0:14:52.790,0:15:01.339
moment well that's a beautiful opening

0:14:57.620,0:15:02.990
round I'd once again from grace and spot

0:15:01.339,0:15:04.700
mention opting for the slightly easier

0:15:02.990,0:15:05.930
inward so this is the top position

0:15:04.700,0:15:07.700
bending at the hips under the knees

0:15:05.930,0:15:10.610
grabbing hold of the shins squeezing

0:15:07.700,0:15:12.230
tight straight up and I've lowered the

0:15:10.610,0:15:14.029
groove difficulties that would see her

0:15:12.230,0:15:16.190
possibly at the bottom of the

0:15:14.029,0:15:19.790
leaderboard so far however another

0:15:16.190,0:15:22.100
consistent dive from grace how people

0:15:19.790,0:15:23.870
have fought wrong say they degree of

0:15:22.100,0:15:26.060
difficulty nowhere near as high as it

0:15:23.870,0:15:29.660
needs to be to change for the medals

0:15:26.060,0:15:31.910
unless everybody drops off but ta do

0:15:29.660,0:15:34.580
what she's capable of doing at this

0:15:31.910,0:15:38.780
stage and she's doing it very well 56.7

0:15:34.580,0:15:43.460
keeps her in the mix Pamela we're 21

0:15:38.780,0:15:45.620
years of age wrong candidate just to

0:15:43.460,0:15:48.320
diving by a dad

0:15:45.620,0:15:52.280
ice hockey oh that ice cream bet it was

0:15:48.320,0:15:54.470
Bob beautiful opening band I fabulous

0:15:52.280,0:15:56.870
entry into the water this is where the

0:15:54.470,0:15:58.940
marks are awarded the take off his goods

0:15:56.870,0:16:01.160
Pike shape could do with squeeze get a

0:15:58.940,0:16:06.890
little tighter little bit of an arch as

0:16:01.160,0:16:08.720
she goes in and that should see her top

0:16:06.890,0:16:11.240
of the leaderboard so far only four

0:16:08.720,0:16:14.270
divers in this final so far bronze

0:16:11.240,0:16:17.210
medalist of the 2013 World Championships

0:16:14.270,0:16:18.770
in Barcelona

0:16:17.210,0:16:20.620
although she has a pedigree to make a

0:16:18.770,0:16:22.400
way through safe further down the

0:16:20.620,0:16:24.140
standings and we thought she would be

0:16:22.400,0:16:25.610
the swine balancer can easy be

0:16:24.140,0:16:29.180
reversible has been in quality

0:16:25.610,0:16:33.410
competitions this week shaky start

0:16:29.180,0:16:36.800
warranted Annabel Smith she would like

0:16:33.410,0:16:38.690
to rectify all that start all over again

0:16:36.800,0:16:40.370
with her inward two and a half summer

0:16:38.690,0:16:41.660
sorts of pike you know this dive by now

0:16:40.370,0:16:44.330
and they will see it several more times

0:16:41.660,0:16:46.030
three point zero degree of difficulty

0:16:44.330,0:16:48.050
for her

0:16:46.030,0:16:51.260
well that's a little bit better than

0:16:48.050,0:16:52.700
this morning on a takeoff she was

0:16:51.260,0:16:54.440
backing away from the diving board a

0:16:52.700,0:16:57.350
little bit too much which can affect the

0:16:54.440,0:16:59.480
rotation but she manages to get after it

0:16:57.350,0:17:02.420
driving those hips up and over ducking

0:16:59.480,0:17:07.340
her chin slightly as she moves past

0:17:02.420,0:17:10.820
vertical into the water server should

0:17:07.340,0:17:14.330
get her over 60 points 63 to be precise

0:17:10.820,0:17:16.880
and easy calculation to make 777 will

0:17:14.330,0:17:21.970
all count towards total multiply that by

0:17:16.880,0:17:21.970
the degree of difficulty gives you 63

0:17:23.020,0:17:30.170
opening dive just in mine and where in

0:17:27.980,0:17:33.350
terms of the standings great early days

0:17:30.170,0:17:37.790
yet by Browns and some bigger dive still

0:17:33.350,0:17:42.250
to come nepeta every oh Malaysia

0:17:37.790,0:17:42.250
once again the inward two and a half

0:17:42.720,0:17:48.480
nice house very impressed with this

0:17:45.090,0:17:50.039
young 15 year old she has sometimes they

0:17:48.480,0:17:52.289
turn in a list which she tends to

0:17:50.039,0:17:54.750
struggle a little bit more with but this

0:17:52.289,0:17:56.970
was a corking opening in the prelims

0:17:54.750,0:17:59.759
she's just allowed that to go over as

0:17:56.970,0:18:01.370
she's entered the water so it won't be

0:17:59.759,0:18:05.120
quite as impressive as it was earlier

0:18:01.370,0:18:09.590
still she'll be one to watch and only

0:18:05.120,0:18:13.200
1563 put right alongside Annabel smith

0:18:09.590,0:18:15.529
seen by the judges as precisely same

0:18:13.200,0:18:17.820
dive in terms of quality

0:18:15.529,0:18:19.100
Alysia black goes for something

0:18:17.820,0:18:23.159
different

0:18:19.100,0:18:24.929
this will be again 3.0 type so the

0:18:23.159,0:18:26.909
degree of difficulty the same but this

0:18:24.929,0:18:30.600
is a Ford two and a half somersaults

0:18:26.909,0:18:41.279
with one twist for the second of the

0:18:30.600,0:18:48.179
English divers will see in the bull side

0:18:41.279,0:18:50.340
with her coach Edwin knows she's

0:18:48.179,0:18:53.070
actually feeling under the weather but

0:18:50.340,0:18:54.690
you would tell from that maybe something

0:18:53.070,0:18:56.970
she's eaten or anything so she's really

0:18:54.690,0:18:58.470
struggling with her energy so this is

0:18:56.970,0:19:00.059
going to be a long start long

0:18:58.470,0:19:03.659
competition for but look at that to kick

0:19:00.059,0:19:05.879
off with 17.5 well whatever she's done

0:19:03.659,0:19:08.299
something has worked Michigan asleep

0:19:05.879,0:19:10.019
feeling a bit restored and refreshed

0:19:08.299,0:19:13.720
17.5 0

0:19:10.019,0:19:21.409
nice job by Alisha flag

0:19:13.720,0:19:23.419
and Lee from Malaysia up next and we're

0:19:21.409,0:19:26.749
back to the N word two and a half again

0:19:23.419,0:19:30.499
best we've seen so far those Pamela

0:19:26.749,0:19:32.809
where and Sabri and Smith they see a

0:19:30.499,0:19:35.200
black boat first to go over 70 in this

0:19:32.809,0:19:35.200
first round

0:19:37.269,0:19:45.830
very very nice well executed it's a

0:19:44.179,0:19:47.269
compare and contrast this that you've

0:19:45.830,0:19:48.889
returned half in the pike position this

0:19:47.269,0:19:50.980
will get over 65 points I think

0:19:48.889,0:19:53.869
finishing higher keeping the splashdown

0:19:50.980,0:19:56.899
than her teammate just two before her

0:19:53.869,0:19:59.629
Sudbury this is the slightly older more

0:19:56.899,0:20:01.850
experienced gangee and she have you

0:19:59.629,0:20:06.970
strapped on a tricep which is no comment

0:20:01.850,0:20:08.590
goes into second place by Delicia black

0:20:06.970,0:20:12.519
[Music]

0:20:08.590,0:20:15.859
on to darling you will have a big smile

0:20:12.519,0:20:18.379
see the mode go I'll receive it when we

0:20:15.859,0:20:21.320
go front Tom smile is out just disappear

0:20:18.379,0:20:24.019
that she gets her game face on it gets

0:20:21.320,0:20:25.460
ready to start the inward two and a half

0:20:24.019,0:20:26.659
seven sauce the best based off the

0:20:25.460,0:20:30.679
English this morning but of course the

0:20:26.659,0:20:32.119
points do not get carried forward 3.0 to

0:20:30.679,0:20:36.200
remind you in word to an hour

0:20:32.119,0:20:37.690
somersaults oh good very good from the

0:20:36.200,0:20:39.790
hand out

0:20:37.690,0:20:41.610
this morning she just probably like a

0:20:39.790,0:20:43.990
lot of the girls a little bit tired

0:20:41.610,0:20:46.090
short water enemy is there ever she

0:20:43.990,0:20:48.400
comes up this is a really strong attacks

0:20:46.090,0:20:51.220
to take off squeeze into that Pike shape

0:20:48.400,0:20:52.810
yeah it's straight up and down probably

0:20:51.220,0:20:56.860
a little bit low on the water for more

0:20:52.810,0:21:02.440
than a seven but we shall see how we'll

0:20:56.860,0:21:05.560
find out now three sevens 63 joint

0:21:02.440,0:21:09.010
fourth but the group of sixty threes

0:21:05.560,0:21:11.050
coming together three more to go three

0:21:09.010,0:21:17.830
best divers from this morning

0:21:11.050,0:21:26.080
up next mr. Jin these diver were to

0:21:17.830,0:21:28.240
Sydney in the year 2009 she will also be

0:21:26.080,0:21:32.950
doing the diver you've seen a lot of all

0:21:28.240,0:21:36.610
around the car 63 to 67 mark so far she

0:21:32.950,0:21:39.400
better that no I think he is a little

0:21:36.610,0:21:42.940
short at vertical to better that she

0:21:39.400,0:21:45.010
will be around about 60 points takeoff

0:21:42.940,0:21:46.840
is okay but she backs away from the time

0:21:45.010,0:21:48.940
you bought a little bit too much which

0:21:46.840,0:21:50.160
leaves her sure to vertical as she goes

0:21:48.940,0:21:54.040
into the water

0:21:50.160,0:21:55.990
the judges will penalize kids will be

0:21:54.040,0:22:01.230
further down the leaderboard

0:21:55.990,0:22:06.669
yeah 61.5 so six and a half and sevens

0:22:01.230,0:22:09.940
4s to chin of that 3.0 dive

0:22:06.669,0:22:15.070
now on to the new zealand-born and now

0:22:09.940,0:22:17.590
australians and medicine kini she is

0:22:15.070,0:22:20.830
certainly one to watch here she was on

0:22:17.590,0:22:22.749
the one so she is in a three not quite

0:22:20.830,0:22:23.350
so expensive on the three sounds what

0:22:22.749,0:22:24.820
she can do

0:22:23.350,0:22:30.789
back two and a half seven salts with

0:22:24.820,0:22:33.159
Pike 3.0 for the Australian or just

0:22:30.789,0:22:34.809
washing over that she goes into the

0:22:33.159,0:22:38.679
water back two and a half somersaults in

0:22:34.809,0:22:40.690
the pike position all of the girls will

0:22:38.679,0:22:42.039
use a back two and a half most of them

0:22:40.690,0:22:44.830
in the pike position the difference

0:22:42.039,0:22:48.509
here's Madison jumps through the roof

0:22:44.830,0:22:51.669
she is so powerful only 18 years old

0:22:48.509,0:22:54.340
credible job wasn't wattmeter she really

0:22:51.669,0:22:58.409
does set herself apart letting a fault

0:22:54.340,0:22:58.409
on the entry causes the marks to be low

0:22:58.529,0:23:10.690
63 which matches what Starling Smith

0:23:04.379,0:23:12.850
Sabri and now key me on 63 this is the

0:23:10.690,0:23:14.320
class act of the field in terms of what

0:23:12.850,0:23:19.080
she's done in the past of what she did

0:23:14.320,0:23:21.399
this morning silver medal from Delhi

0:23:19.080,0:23:24.249
already got the 1 meter title under her

0:23:21.399,0:23:30.609
belt system affable with her inward two

0:23:24.249,0:23:33.429
and a half somersaults yep she's 74

0:23:30.609,0:23:36.340
years ago the gold medal last night in

0:23:33.429,0:23:38.590
the 1 meter springboard and here she is

0:23:36.340,0:23:41.850
on her favorite three meter top

0:23:38.590,0:23:50.619
qualifier ready to open up her campaign

0:23:41.850,0:23:51.190
its steady steadfast where she's out

0:23:50.619,0:23:52.840
this evening

0:23:51.190,0:23:57.909
Church 5 didn't like you very much but

0:23:52.840,0:24:00.940
sevens and a 7.5 for Jennifer and of the

0:23:57.909,0:24:02.409
first round of five off the 3-meter

0:24:00.940,0:24:04.450
springboard for women that's how it

0:24:02.409,0:24:07.359
looks police see a black at the top only

0:24:04.450,0:24:10.720
person to go over 70 in the first minute

0:24:07.359,0:24:13.509
lovely start and an ye and second place

0:24:10.720,0:24:16.029
a couple of Canadians tied for third and

0:24:13.509,0:24:17.769
grace read that you just have a lower

0:24:16.029,0:24:20.109
degree of difficulty for a majority of a

0:24:17.769,0:24:23.919
program so I expect you to keep up with

0:24:20.109,0:24:25.090
the more established performers but you

0:24:23.919,0:24:30.970
get middle of the time they'll be a

0:24:25.090,0:24:36.580
great achievement round 2 of the 3-meter

0:24:30.970,0:24:38.049
springboard for women young young smoke

0:24:36.580,0:24:39.730
it in 12th place we could get rid of 2

0:24:38.049,0:24:44.349
this morning but she got in in 12 for

0:24:39.730,0:24:46.720
the for three and a half yet little bit

0:24:44.349,0:24:48.129
of difficulty with this in training so

0:24:46.720,0:24:50.109
what's this so good in the preliminaries

0:24:48.129,0:24:51.489
and she's missed it again in the final

0:24:50.109,0:24:52.809
four three and a half in the tuck

0:24:51.489,0:24:54.789
position but Nick at the knees bending

0:24:52.809,0:24:57.399
at the hips in the Tuck shape just

0:24:54.789,0:24:57.940
holding on to that touchy a fraction too

0:24:57.399,0:25:02.440
long

0:24:57.940,0:25:08.080
over rotating listener a change so all

0:25:02.440,0:25:12.220
in all know that great but 6.5 it's an

0:25:08.080,0:25:13.269
okay return for Sean John Young of

0:25:12.220,0:25:18.580
Malaysia

0:25:13.269,0:25:20.859
fifty four point six zero for that the

0:25:18.580,0:25:24.129
gallantry gold with Elise here black in

0:25:20.859,0:25:27.669
the three metre synchro made a senior

0:25:24.129,0:25:29.649
debut 10 years ago for Great Britain she

0:25:27.669,0:25:35.769
is for England there's a reverse two and

0:25:29.649,0:25:38.559
a half somersaults with Mike yes that's

0:25:35.769,0:25:41.049
a good dive from from Becky this is the

0:25:38.559,0:25:43.269
one that sometimes can get away from her

0:25:41.049,0:25:46.149
she has a tendency to pull the dive over

0:25:43.269,0:25:48.549
this time she waits let's go at the

0:25:46.149,0:25:50.710
correct time little bit of a back arch a

0:25:48.549,0:25:52.989
little bit of an overvote ation so she

0:25:50.710,0:25:54.519
probably won't get more than a 7 which

0:25:52.989,0:25:57.080
is a shame because the height on that

0:25:54.519,0:26:02.330
time is excellent

0:25:57.080,0:26:04.970
Oh ticket they took the cameraman out

0:26:02.330,0:26:06.710
there I'm doing my son bullshit that's

0:26:04.970,0:26:14.390
more importantly the cameraman took care

0:26:06.710,0:26:19.310
out there Rebecca captain streaky grace

0:26:14.390,0:26:23.570
read smile when she got onto the board

0:26:19.310,0:26:24.710
no it's a studied concentration 2.8 on

0:26:23.570,0:26:26.360
this one

0:26:24.710,0:26:28.970
yes we're tuck and rather with pike

0:26:26.360,0:26:31.270
forward three and a half somersaults for

0:26:28.970,0:26:35.630
all these Scots

0:26:31.270,0:26:38.240
she is just rising to the occasion low

0:26:35.630,0:26:44.090
on the degree of difficulty yes but high

0:26:38.240,0:26:47.030
on the consistency unfaltering under the

0:26:44.090,0:26:49.550
expectation of this home cried in a home

0:26:47.030,0:26:51.140
pool home country and she certainly

0:26:49.550,0:26:55.820
takes that forward three and a half on

0:26:51.140,0:27:01.250
and there's a great job she just Simmons

0:26:55.820,0:27:03.380
never shabby and 58.8 walk with her

0:27:01.250,0:27:06.670
right alongside Rebecca gallantry at the

0:27:03.380,0:27:11.000
moment should be another one of our

0:27:06.670,0:27:13.640
emerging divers for a future Pamela

0:27:11.000,0:27:15.110
where not only third that's where she

0:27:13.640,0:27:16.910
fish at bass load of the world champs

0:27:15.110,0:27:18.370
last year for three and a half for her

0:27:16.910,0:27:21.140
[Music]

0:27:18.370,0:27:23.810
well she's got a point to prove she's

0:27:21.140,0:27:26.540
coming out in attacking every one of

0:27:23.810,0:27:28.400
these dives not holding back at all see

0:27:26.540,0:27:30.680
example you really need to get after

0:27:28.400,0:27:32.990
this it's 3.12 griffith going for a

0:27:30.680,0:27:34.760
reason it's difficult you need the high

0:27:32.990,0:27:38.420
if you get invited yet sevens you're

0:27:34.760,0:27:43.210
gonna get mid-60s 65 66 and that's what

0:27:38.420,0:27:47.120
she'll be looking for exactly 60 5.10

0:27:43.210,0:27:48.740
gonna face so maybe she expected more

0:27:47.120,0:27:50.309
either from the judges or might be of

0:27:48.740,0:27:52.559
herself there but

0:27:50.309,0:27:55.890
that's just a game face your game face

0:27:52.559,0:27:57.450
yeah I know well there you go

0:27:55.890,0:28:02.940
yeah you probably played rose on point

0:27:57.450,0:28:04.950
did she flee shit Annabel Smith where

0:28:02.940,0:28:11.820
they reverse two and a half some resorts

0:28:04.950,0:28:13.590
with Mike 3.0 for the Australian well

0:28:11.820,0:28:15.840
leaving the dive short vertical there

0:28:13.590,0:28:17.039
went Bob on the takeoff if you listen

0:28:15.840,0:28:18.659
carefully you might be up to here on the

0:28:17.039,0:28:20.700
replay obviously but she stamps the

0:28:18.659,0:28:22.169
diving board she's not on the end so

0:28:20.700,0:28:23.610
there's a missed coordination with a

0:28:22.169,0:28:25.590
diving board did that I being board is

0:28:23.610,0:28:27.659
your friend you need to t treat it

0:28:25.590,0:28:29.220
nicely so go down with it and then it'll

0:28:27.659,0:28:31.679
fling you up in the air if you stamp it

0:28:29.220,0:28:35.720
it'll flick you off that's what happened

0:28:31.679,0:28:38.240
to Annabel yeah really

0:28:35.720,0:28:44.720
you pay a little pay for those channels

0:28:38.240,0:28:44.720
5.5 s cross aboard 49.5 Annabel Smith

0:28:48.170,0:28:56.130
damnit ah Sabri for Malaysia goes with

0:28:53.490,0:29:03.630
the fourth three and a half somersaults

0:28:56.130,0:29:05.280
with Mike currently in fifth place it's

0:29:03.630,0:29:07.710
a good dive this is her favorite

0:29:05.280,0:29:08.940
movements the forward and the inward

0:29:07.710,0:29:10.770
that she opened up with in the first

0:29:08.940,0:29:12.420
round little bit back from the end of

0:29:10.770,0:29:15.690
the time you bots are making it hard

0:29:12.420,0:29:20.220
work but she does hang on just about

0:29:15.690,0:29:21.990
long enough to get it in so this was

0:29:20.220,0:29:23.400
good in the prelims not quite as good in

0:29:21.990,0:29:26.790
the same quality because of the falter

0:29:23.400,0:29:28.800
on the takeoff so maybe the 15-yard for

0:29:26.790,0:29:30.480
Malaysia will start to slip away now as

0:29:28.800,0:29:32.340
she moves towards the weaker part of her

0:29:30.480,0:29:34.050
program and she didn't lead at one stage

0:29:32.340,0:29:37.950
this morning but not gonna be leaving

0:29:34.050,0:29:41.790
here 55.8 0 not a great return on that

0:29:37.950,0:29:44.460
dive for Dara Tysabri now Elise you're

0:29:41.790,0:29:46.950
black cause our current leader only

0:29:44.460,0:29:47.550
person in the first round to go over 70

0:29:46.950,0:29:49.020
points

0:29:47.550,0:29:51.900
now wouldn't be nice she kept backing

0:29:49.020,0:29:56.160
that up with her back two and a half

0:29:51.900,0:29:58.860
somersaults 3.0 needs 60 though be in

0:29:56.160,0:30:00.660
front panel aware now we know that she

0:29:58.860,0:30:03.050
is more than capable of getting 60 on

0:30:00.660,0:30:03.050
this dive

0:30:11.090,0:30:18.390
so those soft in her body she went into

0:30:14.640,0:30:21.450
the water arching through the back so

0:30:18.390,0:30:23.430
swinging the arms take off looks okay I

0:30:21.450,0:30:25.410
did mention in mind one that she isn't

0:30:23.430,0:30:28.200
very well now she looked a little weak

0:30:25.410,0:30:30.840
on the takeoff they're a little soft on

0:30:28.200,0:30:33.240
the way out to dive look like hard works

0:30:30.840,0:30:35.700
so I'm hoping she's got enough energy

0:30:33.240,0:30:42.450
for the next three dives rubbing your

0:30:35.700,0:30:44.100
eyes yeah so it's tough to put yourself

0:30:42.450,0:30:47.670
through that I should look at all well

0:30:44.100,0:30:55.350
does she its second the time being I'll

0:30:47.670,0:30:57.630
be back ping Yin Yi of Malaysia me right

0:30:55.350,0:31:01.950
- she was off the first round with the

0:30:57.630,0:31:04.590
DC of black bleeding yes her for three

0:31:01.950,0:31:06.900
and a half worth three point one in the

0:31:04.590,0:31:13.740
pike position so a high tariff dive for

0:31:06.900,0:31:16.040
her everyone executed as well Lasky

0:31:13.740,0:31:16.040
effort

0:31:16.460,0:31:24.049
from the old of elysian you need 21 is 3

0:31:20.809,0:31:26.240
in the final young opening up she's the

0:31:24.049,0:31:27.889
first diver this is one of her hardest

0:31:26.240,0:31:30.409
dives or the hardest dive by way of

0:31:27.889,0:31:32.299
degree of difficulty 3.1 she's done a

0:31:30.409,0:31:34.700
good job they'll be high 60s and she

0:31:32.299,0:31:37.429
goes into the lead hello quite 70 but

0:31:34.700,0:31:41.629
very closer 60 8.20 she does go into

0:31:37.429,0:31:43.610
Libra 7.5 and 7s and Hannah Starling and

0:31:41.629,0:31:46.610
Esther chin who will follow her we'll

0:31:43.610,0:31:48.830
all be going with the same dive so we

0:31:46.610,0:31:53.389
were to move difficulty just up the

0:31:48.830,0:31:55.610
notch to 3.1 just preparing yourself for

0:31:53.389,0:31:58.460
her for three and a half somersaults

0:31:55.610,0:32:05.080
currently in fifth place 72 will take

0:31:58.460,0:32:05.080
her into the lead boy it's very good

0:32:05.550,0:32:09.960
I'm not sure whether that would be good

0:32:07.080,0:32:12.420
enough to get over 70 points it is three

0:32:09.960,0:32:14.120
point one degree of difficulty she does

0:32:12.420,0:32:16.740
go up up and away

0:32:14.120,0:32:19.350
hichy into the water it's a little bit

0:32:16.740,0:32:20.970
low she ends up short but then ducks

0:32:19.350,0:32:23.340
ahead and ends up going over so this

0:32:20.970,0:32:25.320
judges Mike penalized quite heavily for

0:32:23.340,0:32:26.880
that let's wait and see

0:32:25.320,0:32:29.010
yeah I think that I will say taking the

0:32:26.880,0:32:30.980
mark off six point five six point five

0:32:29.010,0:32:33.480
and six point five will count remember

0:32:30.980,0:32:36.450
those marks would light through them do

0:32:33.480,0:32:38.670
not count the overall score at sixty

0:32:36.450,0:32:43.200
point four five is what she receives for

0:32:38.670,0:32:46.290
that third place now now the big three

0:32:43.200,0:32:49.620
from this morning that's the chin up

0:32:46.290,0:32:50.940
first same dive once again you'll see

0:32:49.620,0:32:57.290
something different from Madison Keaney

0:32:50.940,0:33:01.290
after this whoa what a beauty an

0:32:57.290,0:33:03.660
absolute beauty Esther slightly further

0:33:01.290,0:33:06.300
down after her first round dive that we

0:33:03.660,0:33:08.910
would expect now this will rocket us

0:33:06.300,0:33:11.100
straight up the leaderboard three point

0:33:08.910,0:33:13.530
one we've seen it before if it gets

0:33:11.100,0:33:16.020
close to 70 points or over 70 points

0:33:13.530,0:33:19.830
she's gonna leapfrog a few of her fellow

0:33:16.020,0:33:22.080
competitors and she does yes she has

0:33:19.830,0:33:25.570
done just that sixteen nine point seven

0:33:22.080,0:33:29.830
five three seven point five and

0:33:25.570,0:33:34.110
it's Malaysia 1 Australia to where the

0:33:29.830,0:33:41.110
Hang en Yi in first place

0:33:34.110,0:33:42.640
Madison kini of Australia now this is a

0:33:41.110,0:33:45.520
lot of Dyson takes time she has a little

0:33:42.640,0:33:47.530
problem with 63 she got in the first

0:33:45.520,0:33:51.910
round reverse two and a half somersaults

0:33:47.530,0:33:55.030
with pike second time round oh she does

0:33:51.910,0:33:56.890
so well hurdle step was a little bit off

0:33:55.030,0:33:58.090
she's leaning so that's the approach to

0:33:56.890,0:34:00.160
the end she's leaning too far forward

0:33:58.090,0:34:02.950
she's right on the corner of the board

0:34:00.160,0:34:05.700
but look at the height she gets you must

0:34:02.950,0:34:08.230
be able to see that at home it is

0:34:05.700,0:34:10.420
incredible especially that she's corner

0:34:08.230,0:34:12.280
boarding which is so he landed the

0:34:10.420,0:34:14.560
corner with a board it's not very easy

0:34:12.280,0:34:16.180
to do anything from there let alone a

0:34:14.560,0:34:18.310
reverse two and a half in the pike

0:34:16.180,0:34:20.170
position and she managed to get seven

0:34:18.310,0:34:22.240
and a half's on it Wow she was virtually

0:34:20.170,0:34:23.920
up in that Glasgow logo by there that's

0:34:22.240,0:34:27.970
how high she went seven point five

0:34:23.920,0:34:29.500
across the board 67.5 and the moment she

0:34:27.970,0:34:31.630
is in their place for that may well

0:34:29.500,0:34:34.600
changed her change is likely to change

0:34:31.630,0:34:38.740
with Jennifer table up next the one

0:34:34.600,0:34:40.590
meter champion always keeps her game

0:34:38.740,0:34:42.910
face on a game head on for the evening

0:34:40.590,0:34:45.040
looked very good this morning so that's

0:34:42.910,0:34:46.510
a worry for everybody else back two and

0:34:45.040,0:34:51.660
a half somersaults with Mike to finish

0:34:46.510,0:34:51.660
round two of the 3-meter springboard

0:34:52.740,0:35:00.160
yeah nice very nice indeed from Jennifer

0:34:58.090,0:35:02.440
golde last night will it be gold again

0:35:00.160,0:35:05.260
tonight so far it looks as though she is

0:35:02.440,0:35:07.980
very much in the hunt for another gold

0:35:05.260,0:35:11.650
medal just allowing the dive to tip over

0:35:07.980,0:35:15.970
slightly vertical so I think it might

0:35:11.650,0:35:18.820
get 8 kept the splash down nicely couple

0:35:15.970,0:35:20.740
of eights and a 7.5 and not quite in the

0:35:18.820,0:35:22.840
Li the mome but very very close to it

0:35:20.740,0:35:26.020
very tight the tops you'll see in a

0:35:22.840,0:35:29.280
moment we reveal the leaderboard at the

0:35:26.020,0:35:33.280
end of round 2 which looks like this and

0:35:29.280,0:35:36.700
yet ye of Malaysia first stable than the

0:35:33.280,0:35:38.230
two Australians for the English diver on

0:35:36.700,0:35:41.140
the front page - murmurs Hannah Starling

0:35:38.230,0:35:44.980
in sick then Elysia flag and Annabel

0:35:41.140,0:35:46.870
Smith just to the moment cast adrift but

0:35:44.980,0:35:48.880
at the bottom of the pile grace Reed for

0:35:46.870,0:35:57.490
Scotland in 9th along with Rebekah

0:35:48.880,0:36:01.750
gallantry young of Malaysia is currently

0:35:57.490,0:36:03.610
ranked 11th and she is opted to go

0:36:01.750,0:36:06.130
because the choice is the divers in

0:36:03.610,0:36:10.380
which order they take these dives for a

0:36:06.130,0:36:13.660
back to earn our somersaults with Viking

0:36:10.380,0:36:17.130
so we don't my Annabel Smith like all

0:36:13.660,0:36:17.130
the other divers in this round

0:36:17.190,0:36:24.850
well she looks CISO cheese a little bit

0:36:21.510,0:36:28.360
well I'm not sure a little bit tired not

0:36:24.850,0:36:29.800
quite got a competition head on she is

0:36:28.360,0:36:33.180
much much better than this

0:36:29.800,0:36:35.740
she only just qualified for this final

0:36:33.180,0:36:38.800
we lost two ladies this morning in the

0:36:35.740,0:36:41.550
prelims and expect much better function

0:36:38.800,0:36:45.130
she is a better diver than this still

0:36:41.550,0:36:48.610
good yeah yeah when she gets her bike

0:36:45.130,0:36:51.040
she can really really get it right yes

0:36:48.610,0:36:52.870
you know absolutely outstanding dives in

0:36:51.040,0:36:54.640
the first four days here that wasn't one

0:36:52.870,0:36:58.870
of them but wasn't too bad

0:36:54.640,0:37:02.770
three sevens Rebecca Gallen teri joint

0:36:58.870,0:37:05.500
night after the second round this one

0:37:02.770,0:37:10.080
will be a 4-3 and our summer sorts with

0:37:05.500,0:37:10.080
Pike war the City of Leeds diver

0:37:12.080,0:37:19.990
terrific tie fun packing

0:37:16.940,0:37:24.170
gold medal in the three metre synchro

0:37:19.990,0:37:26.840
Delicia blag good for three and a half

0:37:24.170,0:37:28.250
feet of pike position punching a hole in

0:37:26.840,0:37:30.890
the water by grabbing the hands she goes

0:37:28.250,0:37:32.180
in you see the sprays on the surface of

0:37:30.890,0:37:34.190
the water there that's so worth

0:37:32.180,0:37:35.930
mentioning that's to disturb the surface

0:37:34.190,0:37:37.520
of the water so the divers know exactly

0:37:35.930,0:37:39.350
where the surface is because if there

0:37:37.520,0:37:41.540
are no sprays no agitation all the

0:37:39.350,0:37:43.280
surface of the water all the divers can

0:37:41.540,0:37:45.560
see is the bottom of the pool so just

0:37:43.280,0:37:47.480
that little bit of spray gives you an

0:37:45.560,0:37:49.460
exact idea where the surface is so when

0:37:47.480,0:37:51.380
you grab your hands just before going in

0:37:49.460,0:37:53.150
you know where it is you have you've

0:37:51.380,0:37:55.340
asked that question and Leon has

0:37:53.150,0:37:57.730
answered it for you Greece reads for two

0:37:55.340,0:38:00.770
and a half somersaults one twist for the

0:37:57.730,0:38:08.480
Scottish diver 3.0 one of her bigger

0:38:00.770,0:38:12.050
tariffs beautiful dive for two and a

0:38:08.480,0:38:13.820
half one twist 3.0 lots going on I'm

0:38:12.050,0:38:15.170
gonna get the rotation into the

0:38:13.820,0:38:16.730
one-and-a-half somersaults there's the

0:38:15.170,0:38:18.170
one twist then complete the extra

0:38:16.730,0:38:20.750
somersault to make it two and a half

0:38:18.170,0:38:27.200
somersaults Gracie's best dive offer

0:38:20.750,0:38:29.570
programs so far we'll get 62 63 any

0:38:27.200,0:38:34.150
advance no we're staying on 63 three

0:38:29.570,0:38:38.109
sevens good nice and solid

0:38:34.150,0:38:40.119
on 78 points already for her say don't

0:38:38.109,0:38:41.920
expect metal from grace it will be far

0:38:40.119,0:38:44.400
too much to expect with the degree of

0:38:41.920,0:38:46.210
difficulty she's got but looking for a

0:38:44.400,0:38:49.480
middle-of-the-pack finish if she can

0:38:46.210,0:38:53.430
achieve it and we're now for Canada and

0:38:49.480,0:38:53.430
we're two and a half fifth

0:38:58.940,0:39:05.760
or faltering she came out all guns

0:39:03.660,0:39:07.440
blazing first two bands put herself in

0:39:05.760,0:39:08.970
the business end of the field was thing

0:39:07.440,0:39:11.250
in fifth after the second man that will

0:39:08.970,0:39:14.280
see her drop from the leaderboard not

0:39:11.250,0:39:16.560
getting enough rotation ended up shorter

0:39:14.280,0:39:18.480
vertical as she goes in weren't

0:39:16.560,0:39:20.640
mentioning us watching the replays here

0:39:18.480,0:39:22.470
the judges did not see the slo-moes they

0:39:20.640,0:39:25.320
do not see the replay they input their

0:39:22.470,0:39:26.970
scores immediately as soon as the divers

0:39:25.320,0:39:28.680
hit the wall to the judges to require to

0:39:26.970,0:39:30.210
put their scores in and they're not

0:39:28.680,0:39:33.150
allowed to look at each other's scores

0:39:30.210,0:39:34.650
or ask each other or confer they as

0:39:33.150,0:39:35.970
little dividers could you see yeah a

0:39:34.650,0:39:37.380
shot where they're divided from each

0:39:35.970,0:39:39.240
other so I'm copying somebody else's

0:39:37.380,0:39:40.710
homework isn't that okay not allowed to

0:39:39.240,0:39:46.050
peek over to go what do you think of

0:39:40.710,0:39:47.730
that one oh six 6.5 Annabel Smith has a

0:39:46.050,0:39:50.430
back two and a half somersaults to

0:39:47.730,0:39:52.250
perform now for us 3.0 for the

0:39:50.430,0:39:54.530
Australian

0:39:52.250,0:39:55.670
that's where the Fon Smith she was right

0:39:54.530,0:39:58.340
down at the bottom of the leaderboard

0:39:55.670,0:39:59.990
after a poor second man died she will

0:39:58.340,0:40:01.460
now pick yourself back up with that when

0:39:59.990,0:40:03.530
they back two and a half in the pike

0:40:01.460,0:40:06.380
position as we look through the replay

0:40:03.530,0:40:10.099
there you can see the strain going

0:40:06.380,0:40:11.570
through the body pulling the top of the

0:40:10.099,0:40:14.869
half of the body onto the bottom half to

0:40:11.570,0:40:17.300
show the pike shape and then next in the

0:40:14.869,0:40:19.700
dyed to land on her head pretty much

0:40:17.300,0:40:21.980
vertically looks pretty much like she

0:40:19.700,0:40:23.930
was doing this morning not quite where

0:40:21.980,0:40:27.440
she needs to be not quite on Form just a

0:40:23.930,0:40:33.680
little way off her favorite face and

0:40:27.440,0:40:36.020
favorite place to point eight so we're

0:40:33.680,0:40:39.609
down in the slightly lower tariff dives

0:40:36.020,0:40:42.910
for the Malaysian that was her Sabri

0:40:39.609,0:40:45.500
there's no Sun a tough position lot Mike

0:40:42.910,0:40:50.270
back two and half so I thought with tuck

0:40:45.500,0:40:52.640
so I took one eight office yeah that's

0:40:50.270,0:40:54.859
okay for supper as I mentioned her first

0:40:52.640,0:40:56.330
two opening main dives a higher degree

0:40:54.859,0:40:58.820
of difficulty there in the pike position

0:40:56.330,0:41:00.770
now she struggles with this particular

0:40:58.820,0:41:02.930
movement the back and the next one that

0:41:00.770,0:41:04.760
she's doing is to reverse so she's

0:41:02.930,0:41:06.880
opting for the easier degree of

0:41:04.760,0:41:09.230
difficulty the 2.8 and tuck position

0:41:06.880,0:41:11.510
spinning in a tuck position is easier

0:41:09.230,0:41:13.940
than spinning in a pike position just

0:41:11.510,0:41:16.770
agreed landing okay on that one is she

0:41:13.940,0:41:19.170
yeah she's quite pleased not sure

0:41:16.770,0:41:20.520
guess I'll little inclination of the

0:41:19.170,0:41:21.690
head to look back at the coach what's

0:41:20.520,0:41:23.460
the coach think coaches are never

0:41:21.690,0:41:26.910
satisfied or something wrong if you get

0:41:23.460,0:41:32.460
a tent or something wrong did he see a

0:41:26.910,0:41:35.180
black very listen stop see what she can

0:41:32.460,0:41:35.180
carry it on now

0:41:36.140,0:41:41.520
would three and a half they know she's

0:41:38.370,0:41:42.900
not being on top of her game but I see

0:41:41.520,0:41:52.170
what the for three and a half will bring

0:41:42.900,0:41:54.270
for her yeah so she isn't feeling top of

0:41:52.170,0:41:56.010
the game but that is around about the

0:41:54.270,0:41:57.510
top of her game on this dive even though

0:41:56.010,0:42:01.250
she's landed right on the corner of the

0:41:57.510,0:42:02.720
board she waits wait she's so so strong

0:42:01.250,0:42:07.470
[Music]

0:42:02.720,0:42:09.330
great dive for Melissa he'll get over 70

0:42:07.470,0:42:11.370
points if it does she'll go to the top

0:42:09.330,0:42:13.040
of the leaderboard once again and that's

0:42:11.370,0:42:15.030
where she was at the end of round one

0:42:13.040,0:42:16.470
won't be there at the end of round three

0:42:15.030,0:42:18.080
I don't think but seventy one point

0:42:16.470,0:42:20.400
three foot sit there temporarily

0:42:18.080,0:42:23.970
fourteen points above Rebecca Gallen

0:42:20.400,0:42:28.890
tree but here is our current leader hang

0:42:23.970,0:42:32.040
in ye of Malaysia it's the back two and

0:42:28.890,0:42:34.650
a half four more time and we'll see this

0:42:32.040,0:42:37.110
from not from how the sign but that's a

0:42:34.650,0:42:38.790
chin starting here something a little

0:42:37.110,0:42:40.980
bit different to come up next but here

0:42:38.790,0:42:45.650
is our current leader needs fifty nine

0:42:40.980,0:42:45.650
to retain that position Oh

0:42:47.400,0:42:54.620
faltering Yangyi over she goes

0:42:51.250,0:42:56.180
take off looked okay so generating

0:42:54.620,0:42:57.980
enough spin speed moving the arms

0:42:56.180,0:42:59.780
squeeze to get to the Pike shape and

0:42:57.980,0:43:02.180
then just reach you back a little bit

0:42:59.780,0:43:04.340
too aggressively tipping over that's

0:43:02.180,0:43:06.950
going to get mid-range so maybe five 5.5

0:43:04.340,0:43:10.760
s for the judges that will see her less

0:43:06.950,0:43:12.350
than 50 points and yeah mm just one dive

0:43:10.760,0:43:14.930
like that can scupper your middle

0:43:12.350,0:43:16.610
chances and though she's in second place

0:43:14.930,0:43:18.110
right now there are four more still to

0:43:16.610,0:43:24.820
come in this round she might find

0:43:18.110,0:43:27.320
herself in quite a plunge Anna Starling

0:43:24.820,0:43:30.410
smile looks at the crowd gets herself

0:43:27.320,0:43:31.700
ready focus on what's uni still chat to

0:43:30.410,0:43:36.830
herself reverse two and a half

0:43:31.700,0:43:38.660
somersaults with Pike Hannah nice really

0:43:36.830,0:43:41.360
nice marvelous died from had a little

0:43:38.660,0:43:43.970
bit of a skip on the take-off moving

0:43:41.360,0:43:45.620
herself Baltimore's the middle of the

0:43:43.970,0:43:47.210
pool but she did have one of her feet

0:43:45.620,0:43:50.000
over the end of the diving board which

0:43:47.210,0:43:53.330
caused that she squares it up nicely she

0:43:50.000,0:43:55.850
gets Evans that's a very good third

0:43:53.330,0:44:00.080
right dive to the 19 year old from

0:43:55.850,0:44:02.630
England punching up they are in the

0:44:00.080,0:44:05.390
positions just behind the medals so we

0:44:02.630,0:44:06.500
see some faltering here and I won't be

0:44:05.390,0:44:08.960
in the top three at the end of this

0:44:06.500,0:44:16.460
round but she's not too far away with

0:44:08.960,0:44:20.840
our 63 three sevens ester chin 20 year

0:44:16.460,0:44:22.460
old a fair share of injury problems

0:44:20.840,0:44:25.820
along the way I take a whole year out

0:44:22.460,0:44:28.790
with ankle problems not so long ago into

0:44:25.820,0:44:31.400
America in 2009 silver in the University

0:44:28.790,0:44:33.860
Games last year she is were they back

0:44:31.400,0:44:37.670
two and a half somersaults

0:44:33.860,0:44:40.460
ah that is the died of her programs so

0:44:37.670,0:44:43.190
far we're looking for a vertical entry

0:44:40.460,0:44:45.050
with no splash and that is exactly what

0:44:43.190,0:44:47.300
we got from Esther chin on this die we

0:44:45.050,0:44:50.690
could see the first type scoring above

0:44:47.300,0:44:52.160
8.5 that's straight up and down if the

0:44:50.690,0:44:54.170
judges are awake and they're in a good

0:44:52.160,0:44:55.940
mood it's like you can go higher

0:44:54.170,0:45:00.160
that's an eight point five all the way

0:44:55.940,0:45:04.340
for me and it is for the judges as well

0:45:00.160,0:45:07.210
they have the same view of that as we do

0:45:04.340,0:45:12.410
from the commentary box 80.5 Spicer chin

0:45:07.210,0:45:15.020
and the Chinese born Australian goes

0:45:12.410,0:45:19.310
into the lead by 13 points from Alisha

0:45:15.020,0:45:21.140
black but the big movers and shakers are

0:45:19.310,0:45:23.320
about to take to the board though just

0:45:21.140,0:45:25.490
count me out of medal position is

0:45:23.320,0:45:27.970
Madison Keaney of Australia she want to

0:45:25.490,0:45:32.170
do something about that the 18 year old

0:45:27.970,0:45:36.050
little problem with this third dive oh

0:45:32.170,0:45:38.420
did she hit the diving board now I'm

0:45:36.050,0:45:40.400
watching it on the screen I wasn't sure

0:45:38.420,0:45:41.870
whether she's hit the diving board let's

0:45:40.400,0:45:43.850
have a look on the replay I think she

0:45:41.870,0:45:45.710
does so she's that high she's right over

0:45:43.850,0:45:47.600
the diver donk there you go she hits her

0:45:45.710,0:45:50.090
feet on the diving board so the judges

0:45:47.600,0:45:52.400
will quite clearly penalize that now

0:45:50.090,0:45:53.930
that is a shame because she's so high

0:45:52.400,0:45:55.340
it's good palette she just needed to

0:45:53.930,0:45:57.530
move the dive a little bit further back

0:45:55.340,0:45:59.870
she hits the feet on double world if

0:45:57.530,0:46:01.700
it's deemed dangerous judge number one

0:45:59.870,0:46:03.500
thought no you hit the board I'm giving

0:46:01.700,0:46:05.330
you one point five the rest of the

0:46:03.500,0:46:07.820
judges choosing fours and four point

0:46:05.330,0:46:10.040
five that could be Madison kini

0:46:07.820,0:46:11.930
I think the medals and that would be a

0:46:10.040,0:46:13.850
real shame yeah she's got a lot of

0:46:11.930,0:46:15.800
talent doesn't always put it all

0:46:13.850,0:46:18.230
together at the right time it's Lanie

0:46:15.800,0:46:21.770
however it's a complete reverse of that

0:46:18.230,0:46:24.470
for two and a half one twist

0:46:21.770,0:46:27.230
unfazed by the diver before her hitting

0:46:24.470,0:46:29.960
her feet on the diving board Jen is in

0:46:27.230,0:46:32.840
the zone focusing on what she can do

0:46:29.960,0:46:35.720
what she needs to do one dive at a time

0:46:32.840,0:46:38.330
that's how you win the couple of games

0:46:35.720,0:46:40.960
and are we looking at the eventual

0:46:38.330,0:46:43.490
champion once again one meter last night

0:46:40.960,0:46:48.500
midway through just over the three meter

0:46:43.490,0:46:51.200
and now clear in the top two with the

0:46:48.500,0:46:53.870
Australian ester chin that's how it

0:46:51.200,0:46:56.180
stands and elysia Black has moved into

0:46:53.870,0:46:58.910
the top three again she was one step

0:46:56.180,0:47:01.130
down a bit but she's found perform in

0:46:58.910,0:47:02.810
round three and she and Hannah Starling

0:47:01.130,0:47:05.480
are in three and four

0:47:02.810,0:47:06.950
Esther chin a great time in round three

0:47:05.480,0:47:08.660
let's put herself in position hey

0:47:06.950,0:47:11.360
Rebecca gantry on the front page so

0:47:08.660,0:47:14.690
three English their grace reads moved up

0:47:11.360,0:47:16.430
to seven and it looks like a big long

0:47:14.690,0:47:18.950
haul back for mass and Keaney and

0:47:16.430,0:47:20.990
Annabel Smith if they're gonna challenge

0:47:18.950,0:47:24.770
for the medals still mathematically

0:47:20.990,0:47:27.800
possible because one to 11 separated by

0:47:24.770,0:47:31.580
just 35 points so they just it's quite a

0:47:27.800,0:47:34.850
lot but a massive difference for them

0:47:31.580,0:47:36.710
reversed two and a half for Shaun yeah

0:47:34.850,0:47:40.100
it's definitely up again this was a real

0:47:36.710,0:47:41.390
beauty in the prelims he got nines well

0:47:40.100,0:47:43.730
I thought she should have got nines I

0:47:41.390,0:47:46.190
think they gave her 8.5 one judge gave

0:47:43.730,0:47:48.740
her a nine and she's done a lot of

0:47:46.190,0:47:50.900
competing over these past few days this

0:47:48.740,0:47:53.360
is day number four the diving here Joe's

0:47:50.900,0:47:57.290
been on pretty much every day she's

0:47:53.360,0:47:59.050
starting to show fatigue seeing a facial

0:47:57.290,0:48:02.290
expression there that she's kind of

0:47:59.050,0:48:02.290
toughing it out

0:48:02.370,0:48:06.220
do you worry about for the cameraman in

0:48:04.720,0:48:08.080
your face because every diver when they

0:48:06.220,0:48:09.400
come out of the pool good bad or

0:48:08.080,0:48:10.900
indifferent as that camera right in

0:48:09.400,0:48:12.310
their face you don't wanna smack them at

0:48:10.900,0:48:14.430
some point no I didn't even notice it

0:48:12.310,0:48:18.010
just focused on what you do

0:48:14.430,0:48:19.990
Rebecca gallantry in word two and a half

0:48:18.010,0:48:23.500
somersaults with tuck in this is down in

0:48:19.990,0:48:25.600
the 2.7 range so consequently means this

0:48:23.500,0:48:28.360
has to be very good if she's to retain

0:48:25.600,0:48:32.500
her sixth position or push a bit further

0:48:28.360,0:48:36.550
up the table and for for the diver

0:48:32.500,0:48:38.380
originally from Essex what a shame she's

0:48:36.550,0:48:40.210
opting for the easier in word so in the

0:48:38.380,0:48:42.580
Tuck position you get less to group

0:48:40.210,0:48:44.860
difficulty just two point seven and then

0:48:42.580,0:48:47.440
creams this really worked for Becky here

0:48:44.860,0:48:50.260
the takeoff is good the exit is okay and

0:48:47.440,0:48:51.820
then she just lets it over rotate baby

0:48:50.260,0:48:55.360
needs to exit the dive a little bit

0:48:51.820,0:48:57.520
sooner to ensure the vertical entry

0:48:55.360,0:48:59.990
[Music]

0:48:57.520,0:49:01.810
watching the B play and you get the

0:48:59.990,0:49:04.490
feedback from a coach ad Hinchcliffe

0:49:01.810,0:49:07.790
saying good start just needs to lighten

0:49:04.490,0:49:14.030
up around the sides 6s yeah less than

0:49:07.790,0:49:16.310
fifty for her Chris reads granddad to

0:49:14.030,0:49:17.870
the exhibition diving the parents

0:49:16.310,0:49:19.940
weren't involved in diving at all but

0:49:17.870,0:49:22.340
that's not Pamela where by the way that

0:49:19.940,0:49:23.870
is definitely grace read on the board

0:49:22.340,0:49:31.070
with a reverse two and a half

0:49:23.870,0:49:34.160
somersaults with tuck well done grace

0:49:31.070,0:49:38.180
I'm laughing because he's just raised a

0:49:34.160,0:49:39.620
cane so consistent she knows she's like

0:49:38.180,0:49:43.190
any degree of difficulty

0:49:39.620,0:49:44.750
he's matching many of the athletes died

0:49:43.190,0:49:48.830
for dive with execution this will get a

0:49:44.750,0:49:50.950
handful of sevens yes she'll be here

0:49:48.830,0:49:54.370
maybe close to sixty points with that

0:49:50.950,0:49:56.810
judge one seniors at seven point five a

0:49:54.370,0:49:59.420
couple of seven point five s discarded

0:49:56.810,0:50:02.480
as are a couple of sevens to that 60

0:49:59.420,0:50:08.050
point two zero low tariff dive very big

0:50:02.480,0:50:11.330
dive in terms of execution and we're

0:50:08.050,0:50:13.340
ain't place at the moment for Canaan but

0:50:11.330,0:50:15.370
that's makeable in terms of the bridging

0:50:13.340,0:50:18.050
the gap reverse two and a half again

0:50:15.370,0:50:21.800
yeah that's gonna help that's certainly

0:50:18.050,0:50:25.340
gonna help fabulous dive off the back of

0:50:21.800,0:50:26.810
her and very average inward two and a

0:50:25.340,0:50:29.000
half in the pike position this is the

0:50:26.810,0:50:31.250
reverse two and a half she reaches time

0:50:29.000,0:50:31.880
just allowing the dive to tip opens tip

0:50:31.250,0:50:34.730
open

0:50:31.880,0:50:36.920
excuse me tip over it's been a long day

0:50:34.730,0:50:38.660
for me as well very warm in this balls

0:50:36.920,0:50:40.190
it's not making up words in a minute you

0:50:38.660,0:50:40.520
never know oh you know what you do that

0:50:40.190,0:50:44.829
anyway

0:50:40.520,0:50:48.849
three sevens sixty-three

0:50:44.829,0:50:51.459
Leon Taylor give you the full lowdown or

0:50:48.849,0:50:53.589
take on that and grace Reid and Pamela

0:50:51.459,0:50:56.559
we're very close together now 244 the

0:50:53.589,0:50:58.450
Canadian 238 or grace Reid and the Bill

0:50:56.559,0:51:03.390
Smith forward three and a half

0:50:58.450,0:51:03.390
samasource with Mike 3.1 biggest I've

0:51:03.630,0:51:07.690
certainly is

0:51:05.200,0:51:09.910
she needed a really good take up on that

0:51:07.690,0:51:11.140
so in order to get the best take off you

0:51:09.910,0:51:12.759
need to land right on the end of the

0:51:11.140,0:51:15.579
diving board she's just a little bit

0:51:12.759,0:51:17.440
back from the end so has to squeeze into

0:51:15.579,0:51:19.569
that pike check darker chin in as she

0:51:17.440,0:51:21.640
enters the water in order to get to the

0:51:19.569,0:51:27.099
close to vertical as possible when she

0:51:21.640,0:51:31.599
does a reasonable job on in mind where

0:51:27.099,0:51:34.989
and read she parks herself which means

0:51:31.599,0:51:41.200
in terms of mills she's a long way shy

0:51:34.989,0:51:43.109
of that no Sudbury very very good this

0:51:41.200,0:51:46.479
morning say she led at one stage but

0:51:43.109,0:51:50.289
she's at the other end of the pack this

0:51:46.479,0:51:54.039
time here comes her 2.8 different

0:51:50.289,0:51:59.979
tariffs on this verse two and a half a

0:51:54.039,0:52:02.589
somersault she's nailed it

0:51:59.979,0:52:04.839
yes much better reverse turn half in the

0:52:02.589,0:52:06.249
Tuck position it's only 2.8 depictive

0:52:04.839,0:52:09.549
good if you were to do it in the pike

0:52:06.249,0:52:12.130
position it's 3.0 summary the 15-year

0:52:09.549,0:52:14.559
old for malaysia here performing this

0:52:12.130,0:52:16.809
dive to the very best of our ability and

0:52:14.559,0:52:18.819
be watching this in training it's one of

0:52:16.809,0:52:20.859
her dies a bogey dies potentially and

0:52:18.819,0:52:23.650
that is very good

0:52:20.859,0:52:25.630
eight and seven point five so the top

0:52:23.650,0:52:30.400
three currently are separated by two

0:52:25.630,0:52:35.270
points and we're double to separate and

0:52:30.400,0:52:37.970
grace Reed 240 plays 239 and 238

0:52:35.270,0:52:42.369
we see a black sky self back in the

0:52:37.970,0:52:44.810
third place not feeling well at all

0:52:42.369,0:52:47.600
first round diamond third round dive

0:52:44.810,0:52:49.760
were exemplary our good would be to see

0:52:47.600,0:52:53.410
a do a brilliant reverse two and a half

0:52:49.760,0:52:53.410
somersaults with pike in round four

0:52:54.190,0:53:01.970
well it was almost brilliant almost

0:52:57.830,0:53:03.980
brilliant beautiful take off the disses

0:53:01.970,0:53:06.500
from the diving board squeezing into the

0:53:03.980,0:53:07.700
Pike shape slight bending and he said

0:53:06.500,0:53:09.800
the judges won't see that she just

0:53:07.700,0:53:11.990
reached back a little bit with a little

0:53:09.800,0:53:13.940
bit too much effort causing the time to

0:53:11.990,0:53:15.890
go over she'd done all the hard work and

0:53:13.940,0:53:17.560
just faltered on the entry she's good

0:53:15.890,0:53:21.800
enough to put her in the lead for now

0:53:17.560,0:53:25.040
248 3054 but she'll be happy when this

0:53:21.800,0:53:29.900
competition is over let's get back in a

0:53:25.040,0:53:32.869
bit get some sleep Europeans are coming

0:53:29.900,0:53:36.710
soon couple of weeks time for her so the

0:53:32.869,0:53:41.570
other British competitors here Hank

0:53:36.710,0:53:43.820
Yin Yi of Malaysia yes place so this

0:53:41.570,0:53:46.940
reverse two-and-a-half is good she could

0:53:43.820,0:53:50.270
put pressure on the likes of Abel and

0:53:46.940,0:53:53.590
chin there's only one more round after

0:53:50.270,0:53:53.590
this this has to be good

0:53:53.960,0:53:59.400
yes that's good from Yangyi reverse turn

0:53:57.420,0:54:03.030
half in the pike position she faltered

0:53:59.400,0:54:05.040
previously on the third round dive it's

0:54:03.030,0:54:07.140
an okay take off a little bit scruffy

0:54:05.040,0:54:10.230
into the pike shape she could get sevens

0:54:07.140,0:54:11.910
on this will hold her wherever she was

0:54:10.230,0:54:15.630
at the end of last round which I think

0:54:11.910,0:54:17.090
was in fifth it's putting pressure to

0:54:15.630,0:54:19.830
making sure they have to hit their dives

0:54:17.090,0:54:25.200
at least you're black still in position

0:54:19.830,0:54:28.170
a though it's things down with four to

0:54:25.200,0:54:32.190
come in this round I can't finish any

0:54:28.170,0:54:35.580
worse than fifth and one place above

0:54:32.190,0:54:38.480
that in fourth after round three was

0:54:35.580,0:54:38.480
Alice darling

0:54:38.600,0:54:44.790
for England nineteen year old from Leeds

0:54:42.000,0:54:46.470
originally a swimmer I swear just before

0:54:44.790,0:54:48.720
a ninth birthday dad I mean look she's

0:54:46.470,0:54:53.160
very glad she did back two and a half

0:54:48.720,0:54:55.740
somersaults with Pike 3.0 for Hannah yes

0:54:53.160,0:54:57.770
very nice sneaks that dive in

0:54:55.740,0:55:00.660
beautifully little bit lower than water

0:54:57.770,0:55:03.180
the take-off is good but she's not

0:55:00.660,0:55:05.220
finishing the dive high enough in order

0:55:03.180,0:55:07.740
to get the drop to get more than seven

0:55:05.220,0:55:14.640
she does a very nice job of fitting that

0:55:07.740,0:55:19.710
in I think close to alyssia's score so

0:55:14.640,0:55:22.380
far she goes to number one only by mana

0:55:19.710,0:55:25.320
mark at one point between our Starling

0:55:22.380,0:55:27.060
and Alicia plaque in second but smile

0:55:25.320,0:55:29.280
returns to the base they were far away

0:55:27.060,0:55:31.710
from that face to be honest he's not

0:55:29.280,0:55:34.830
current leader marginally in front of

0:55:31.710,0:55:36.120
Jennifer Abel I think she would have a

0:55:34.830,0:55:40.250
distance between herself and the

0:55:36.120,0:55:40.250
Canadian with her reverse two and a half

0:55:40.940,0:55:49.400
oh she was in the lead before and now

0:55:45.670,0:55:52.330
she's gonna be difficult to beat the

0:55:49.400,0:55:54.740
Australians cheering and so they should

0:55:52.330,0:55:56.500
beautiful die from Esther chin reverse

0:55:54.740,0:55:59.300
two and a half at the pike position

0:55:56.500,0:56:02.090
drills that entry could be eight point

0:55:59.300,0:56:05.240
five maybe even a nine if it is she's

0:56:02.090,0:56:07.700
gonna go 75 and then she's gonna be

0:56:05.240,0:56:10.460
difficult it's a catch just what he

0:56:07.700,0:56:13.340
dived to go for Esther chin two divers

0:56:10.460,0:56:16.550
in this round 76 54

0:56:13.340,0:56:19.580
Esther Jen 8.5 course the board so

0:56:16.550,0:56:22.100
that's a big margin that she's open up

0:56:19.580,0:56:25.670
on the rest nobody in the to 80 range

0:56:22.100,0:56:28.010
embryos in the two 40s so Madsen Keaney

0:56:25.670,0:56:32.240
I think their last dive is done for her

0:56:28.010,0:56:38.030
chances of a medal it's a for three and

0:56:32.240,0:56:40.940
a half now you've got to give credit to

0:56:38.030,0:56:43.490
this young lady she's only 18 and she is

0:56:40.940,0:56:44.300
a super talent she has got so much

0:56:43.490,0:56:46.490
potential

0:56:44.300,0:56:48.290
we're Lance just on the end of the

0:56:46.490,0:56:49.910
diving pool but look how high above the

0:56:48.290,0:56:52.670
five meter board in the background she

0:56:49.910,0:56:54.560
goes that's a beautiful dive 68 poison

0:56:52.670,0:56:57.650
that will squeeze the gap she'll only be

0:56:54.560,0:56:59.150
ten points off of mental now it's up too

0:56:57.650,0:57:02.350
far let's wait and see what happens

0:56:59.150,0:57:05.960
it'll be down to the exciting last round

0:57:02.350,0:57:09.170
Esther chin goes to 84 where this mess

0:57:05.960,0:57:11.330
and Keaney go to 39.2 there's 10 points

0:57:09.170,0:57:13.400
behind have a starling 9 mind Alyssia

0:57:11.330,0:57:15.830
black

0:57:13.400,0:57:16.750
the moment house darling is in a middle

0:57:15.830,0:57:19.180
position

0:57:16.750,0:57:21.590
Jennifer avol knows that she has to be

0:57:19.180,0:57:24.610
top of her game now the catch has to

0:57:21.590,0:57:27.050
chip with her for three and a half oh

0:57:24.610,0:57:29.840
well she does need to be top of a game

0:57:27.050,0:57:32.660
in that is not top of her game she will

0:57:29.840,0:57:35.330
go into the silver medal position at the

0:57:32.660,0:57:37.760
moment with one man to go this is three

0:57:35.330,0:57:40.520
point one she would have needed eights

0:57:37.760,0:57:43.850
to catch Esther chin that is less than

0:57:40.520,0:57:46.100
eight the chair centering the water

0:57:43.850,0:57:48.460
still in a slight Pike position throwing

0:57:46.100,0:57:51.980
up a bit of splash coming towards us

0:57:48.460,0:57:54.920
she's gonna be left points to make up in

0:57:51.980,0:57:57.740
round number five if she wants to get

0:57:54.920,0:58:00.260
the gold and she doesn't want to do the

0:57:57.740,0:58:01.850
double here does Jennifer but at the

0:58:00.260,0:58:02.300
moment she was sold methods four years

0:58:01.850,0:58:05.210
ago

0:58:02.300,0:58:08.510
that's where she's heading in 2014 as

0:58:05.210,0:58:11.300
the chin to 84 look at that and a

0:58:08.510,0:58:14.690

place so this hopefully look it's for we

0:58:23.630,0:58:26.450
go into the round well the degree of

0:58:25.130,0:58:28.100

English divers here yes so let's see a

0:58:45.460,0:58:49.490
no choke very much off her game this

0:58:47.870,0:58:51.500
evening what a shame because when she's

0:58:49.490,0:58:53.870
diving well she's that did like to watch

0:58:51.500,0:58:56.450
this evening tough day at the office

0:58:53.870,0:58:58.970
finishing up here with a very average

0:58:56.450,0:59:00.700
dive to go with a very average list of

0:58:58.970,0:59:03.080
dies what a shame because she is a

0:59:00.700,0:59:08.810
beautiful diver and we haven't seen the

0:59:03.080,0:59:10.070
best of her this evening 5.5 s I saw

0:59:08.810,0:59:11.660
those some people to make you a night of

0:59:10.070,0:59:13.160

0:59:11.660,0:59:15.110
the drinks in and they're watching us

0:59:13.160,0:59:16.190
tonight they've set their Saturday night

0:59:15.110,0:59:18.800
aside for

0:59:16.190,0:59:20.390
Leon and Bob who said having Leon

0:59:18.800,0:59:24.310
Saturday night it's heavy out here and

0:59:20.390,0:59:29.109
sir it's like harking back to the winter

0:59:24.310,0:59:32.359
for the fire Rob put your slippers off

0:59:29.109,0:59:34.609
Rebecca Gallen tree it's not gonna be a

0:59:32.359,0:59:37.010
metal day for her today that she may

0:59:34.609,0:59:39.530
well finish where she started in terms

0:59:37.010,0:59:42.319
of the dye border in 11th place that's

0:59:39.530,0:59:44.780
where she is right now back two and a

0:59:42.319,0:59:47.300
half sour sauce with pike for Becky to

0:59:44.780,0:59:54.290
finish off with it's worth three point

0:59:47.300,0:59:56.329
zero God she sneaks out it within I see

0:59:54.290,0:59:58.609
just a little bit aggressive as she goes

0:59:56.329,0:59:59.960
into the water the divers pretty much

0:59:58.609,1:00:01.369
know when they hit the water whether

0:59:59.960,1:00:02.930
it's good or not you get a feeling

1:00:01.369,1:00:05.060
through your body bit of a shock wave

1:00:02.930,1:00:07.040
baby and think you would have felt the

1:00:05.060,1:00:08.660
water hit on his shins and ankles she's

1:00:07.040,1:00:10.339
got instance she knows that she won't be

1:00:08.660,1:00:12.829
coming up to AIDS but she definitely

1:00:10.339,1:00:13.630
better than four so sevens coming her

1:00:12.829,1:00:17.060
way

1:00:13.630,1:00:23.180
sevens is exactly and precisely what you

1:00:17.060,1:00:26.180
get 63 for Becky gallantry 292 20 grace

1:00:23.180,1:00:29.050
read last tide biggest cheer of the

1:00:26.180,1:00:31.220
night for her she has performs

1:00:29.050,1:00:33.380
impeccably all the way through it's a

1:00:31.220,1:00:35.030
low tariff time to finish with but it's

1:00:33.380,1:00:38.270
the quality of the diving which has been

1:00:35.030,1:00:40.819
so impressive from grace these was from

1:00:38.270,1:00:43.250
James Heatley when he was diving in the

1:00:40.819,1:00:45.740
men's event back two and a half

1:00:43.250,1:00:49.250
somersault with tuck for her must die

1:00:45.740,1:00:51.260
for Scotland's grace Reed does she

1:00:49.250,1:00:53.640
finishes off in style a little bit too

1:00:51.260,1:00:57.119
much splash being thrown up

1:00:53.640,1:00:59.549
she has done so well in the one meeting

1:00:57.119,1:01:01.980
yesterday prelims and finals and today

1:00:59.549,1:01:03.900
in the 3-meter prelims and finals so

1:01:01.980,1:01:06.299
coach jenny lehmann will be thrilled

1:01:03.900,1:01:08.670
so are the crowd so will her parents be

1:01:06.299,1:01:12.210
here we're both here to watch her great

1:01:08.670,1:01:13.980
dive good finish and what a wonderful

1:01:12.210,1:01:16.099
couple games her second would you

1:01:13.980,1:01:18.329
believe at the age of 18 nearly 300

1:01:16.099,1:01:19.920
nearly 300 she would love to have been

1:01:18.329,1:01:22.500
there well she's not too far shy and

1:01:19.920,1:01:23.849
sure a barrier to got a picture of the

1:01:22.500,1:01:26.339
score wall was currently shows her in

1:01:23.849,1:01:28.230
first place she's not gonna finish there

1:01:26.339,1:01:31.740
she's not a fish in the medals but the

1:01:28.230,1:01:36.299
time being she is hitting the table and

1:01:31.740,1:01:39.539
we're in sixth for two-and-a-half

1:01:36.299,1:01:42.539
samasource one twist 3.0 for finishing

1:01:39.539,1:01:45.900
off she finishes off with a marvelous

1:01:42.539,1:01:48.240
dive 3.0 the forward two and a half one

1:01:45.900,1:01:49.819
twist we're gonna see this a lot coming

1:01:48.240,1:01:53.369
up there's going to be the consecutive

1:01:49.819,1:01:55.710
for two and a half one twist only two

1:01:53.369,1:01:58.079
athletes coming up at the next eight

1:01:55.710,1:02:00.779
electing not to do this partners

1:01:58.079,1:02:05.130
starting it off good steps point fives

1:02:00.779,1:02:08.309
yeah nice 60 7.50

1:02:05.130,1:02:11.700
she is the first of the divers to go

1:02:08.309,1:02:13.380
over 300 300 8.10 would not I don't

1:02:11.700,1:02:15.630
think be enough so a quick calculation

1:02:13.380,1:02:20.400
hardly like you to be good enough for a

1:02:15.630,1:02:23.099
medal today rather disappointing it

1:02:20.400,1:02:27.210
Annabel Smith today just quite worked

1:02:23.099,1:02:29.640
out for either in the prelims or in the

1:02:27.210,1:02:31.289
final type for two and a half with one

1:02:29.640,1:02:35.099
twist we mentioned you'll see a lot more

1:02:31.289,1:02:36.630
to finish off it's a solid finish for

1:02:35.099,1:02:38.520
Manorville Smith

1:02:36.630,1:02:40.740
she was intent after the fourth lines

1:02:38.520,1:02:42.330
and I think she'll be around about that

1:02:40.740,1:02:44.070
place after that as well even though

1:02:42.330,1:02:46.440
that's a good dive lots of the girls

1:02:44.070,1:02:48.090
finishing on their best dives which

1:02:46.440,1:02:52.520
makes sense you want to finish on a good

1:02:48.090,1:02:54.960
one this is good from Smith probably

1:02:52.520,1:02:57.210
identical scores coming her way as we

1:02:54.960,1:03:00.900
saw for the Canadian Pamela just before

1:02:57.210,1:03:03.330
her 7.5 s across the board 67 so she

1:03:00.900,1:03:11.010
isn't quite get over the rubric another

1:03:03.330,1:03:14.310
300 next up it is dammit

1:03:11.010,1:03:17.490
Sabri we've seen it mix back from her

1:03:14.310,1:03:20.780
today very impressive in parts in the

1:03:17.490,1:03:24.210
morning not quite so this evening and

1:03:20.780,1:03:26.400
again it is that forward two and a half

1:03:24.210,1:03:30.570
so you're able to look and see what you

1:03:26.400,1:03:34.890
think along with the judges 3.0 on the

1:03:30.570,1:03:37.860
DD our fault we got her last dive as

1:03:34.890,1:03:40.880
well it's unfortunate because what 415

1:03:37.860,1:03:44.150
she's doing a sterling job isn't she

1:03:40.880,1:03:48.090
lots to learn great cover wealth games

1:03:44.150,1:03:50.910
lots to take away but no medals and she

1:03:48.090,1:03:53.580
will drop down the leaderboard there put

1:03:50.910,1:03:56.750
it behind the banker gallantry and grace

1:03:53.580,1:04:00.330
Reed at one stage she was ahead of both

1:03:56.750,1:04:02.820
45 that's what she's got on that another

1:04:00.330,1:04:03.140
great return and there are six more to

1:04:02.820,1:04:06.450
go

1:04:03.140,1:04:07.860
the 1 2 3 is where Smith and Reed but

1:04:06.450,1:04:11.820
knowing any of those are gonna get

1:04:07.860,1:04:13.950
medals now they see a black still in

1:04:11.820,1:04:17.010
fourth place and still in a position to

1:04:13.950,1:04:21.390
challenge but and here's the big but it

1:04:17.010,1:04:23.550
is a low tariff dive 2.7 it's a bit like

1:04:21.390,1:04:24.960
a Tonya couch on the 10 finishing with a

1:04:23.550,1:04:28.020
lower tariff tie but one that she feels

1:04:24.960,1:04:32.480
comfortable with and this is an inward

1:04:28.020,1:04:32.480
two and a half somersaults with tuck

1:04:34.360,1:04:38.450
well she's giving her best shot she

1:04:37.040,1:04:40.490
isn't feeling very well this year

1:04:38.450,1:04:41.660
shaking hand she comes out she knows too

1:04:40.490,1:04:44.060
soon she hit the water

1:04:41.660,1:04:46.220
you'll feel parts of your body going

1:04:44.060,1:04:48.530
through and if it's smooth it's a ripper

1:04:46.220,1:04:50.030
tree if you get hit by the water which

1:04:48.530,1:04:51.950
is what alyssa has happened that means

1:04:50.030,1:04:54.140
she's throwing up splash she won't get

1:04:51.950,1:04:56.180
above sevens on this low degree of

1:04:54.140,1:04:56.870
difficulty she will not win a medal what

1:04:56.180,1:04:59.150
a shame

1:04:56.870,1:05:01.850
hope she feels better soon yeah get well

1:04:59.150,1:05:04.520
soon Elise yep she just wants to get

1:05:01.850,1:05:06.620
away from here and we get straight to

1:05:04.520,1:05:08.240
bed and just recover but good luck

1:05:06.620,1:05:10.370
choice she's out I know she's with the

1:05:08.240,1:05:11.870
Europeans very shortly so couple of

1:05:10.370,1:05:14.050
weeks to recover and get her back in

the end of the diving board she manages

1:05:43.910,1:05:47.210
to pop the diaper that will put her top

1:05:45.830,1:05:50.180
of the leaderboard actually with that

1:06:34.380,1:06:38.880
understanding will that be enough she's

1:06:36.840,1:06:41.790
thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of

1:06:38.880,1:06:45.360
them let's wait and see what happens Wow

1:06:41.790,1:06:47.640
I am super impressed beautiful type that

1:06:45.360,1:06:51.150
so died for the competition that's going

1:06:47.640,1:06:55.110
to go over 65 points and that might be

1:06:51.150,1:06:56.790
enough for a medal I'll pour my rather

1:06:55.110,1:06:58.220
damaged reputation on the line and say

1:06:56.790,1:07:02.460
it will be good enough remember I'm sure

1:06:58.220,1:07:06.000
sure now with that it's colorful

1:07:02.460,1:07:08.340
pressure on everybody else God has to

1:07:06.000,1:07:10.170
chain the leader Jennifer able to come

1:07:08.340,1:07:11.700
mazzantini between across mass and key

1:07:10.170,1:07:14.880
is still mathematically gonna overtake

1:07:11.700,1:07:16.530
that at the moment in the more one

1:07:14.880,1:07:17.940
position is Hannah Starling with three

1:07:16.530,1:07:21.180
hundred sixteen point nine five

1:07:17.940,1:07:23.700
interesting stuff now 32 is all as the

1:07:21.180,1:07:27.060
chin needs to overtake Hannah on her for

1:07:23.700,1:07:28.160
two and a half well I think we could be

1:07:27.060,1:07:31.050
looking at the Commonwealth Games

1:07:28.160,1:07:32.970
champion right there she had a bit of a

1:07:31.050,1:07:33.660
lead Jennifer a ball probably is the

1:07:32.970,1:07:36.269
only

1:07:33.660,1:07:38.099
can capture as the chair has been

1:07:36.269,1:07:39.960
rocking it this evening and that's a

1:07:38.099,1:07:42.839
really good dive to finish but it's not

1:07:39.960,1:07:44.789
out of Jennifer Abel's reach it's not as

1:07:42.839,1:07:47.430
good as Hanna starlings it'll get moving

1:07:44.789,1:07:48.029
or mid-60s probably with sevens coming

1:07:47.430,1:07:50.339
her way

1:07:48.029,1:07:53.069
yeah three four seven is the point to be

1:07:50.339,1:07:56.430
and only able could do that and she is

1:07:53.069,1:07:57.990
up after Madison Keaney they in 75

1:07:56.430,1:08:00.690
although that's maybe seventy six she

1:07:57.990,1:08:02.819
needs it's gonna have to be a spot on

1:08:00.690,1:08:04.440
the she can make in her last type which

1:08:02.819,1:08:06.569
is a different die from everybody else's

1:08:04.440,1:08:09.539
that you've seen recently now Madison

1:08:06.569,1:08:11.490
kini cannot catch Esther chinch he can

1:08:09.539,1:08:14.490
catch Hannah styling with a seventy

1:08:11.490,1:08:16.500
seven point seven on this forward to an

1:08:14.490,1:08:20.850
are they the under seventy seven Hannah

1:08:16.500,1:08:23.040
has a medal oh it's a good tie from the

1:08:20.850,1:08:24.960
Australian I do not think that will be

1:08:23.040,1:08:27.210
good enough for her to stand on the

1:08:24.960,1:08:29.759
podium of course she hit the feet on the

1:08:27.210,1:08:33.210
diving board in dramatic fashion so that

1:08:29.759,1:08:35.790
means that Hannah Starling will win at

1:08:33.210,1:08:37.889
least the bronze at least the bronze

1:08:35.790,1:08:39.929
that's good diving from the Australian

1:08:37.889,1:08:41.850
she is a super talent but I am

1:08:39.929,1:08:44.100
absolutely thrilled for Hannah Starling

1:08:41.850,1:08:47.960
I can now confirm or stand on the podium

1:08:44.100,1:08:52.080
she will at least on the rung of three

1:08:47.960,1:08:54.779
because Esther chin has a middle and a

1:08:52.080,1:08:57.600
starling has a medal what color we would

1:08:54.779,1:08:59.670
discover in the next minute the scenario

1:08:57.600,1:09:02.819
is straightforward it's easy it's simple

1:08:59.670,1:09:04.889
it's seventy three point five in other

1:09:02.819,1:09:08.480
words kind of eight and a half's really

1:09:04.889,1:09:11.150
for Jeff Abel for gold for Canada

1:09:08.480,1:09:14.810
no it won't be gold for Canada it's gold

1:09:11.150,1:09:17.170
faust raelia that will be I think good

1:09:14.810,1:09:21.440
enough for silver she only needs five

1:09:17.170,1:09:23.960
5.5 s to ensure the silver it's not very

1:09:21.440,1:09:26.540
good it will be very close but I think

1:09:23.960,1:09:28.549
it's good enough it's a job dye from the

1:09:26.540,1:09:30.380
diffe world of defending champion but

1:09:28.549,1:09:32.480
the one meter champion silver medalist

1:09:30.380,1:09:35.870
for use we can see her disappointment

1:09:32.480,1:09:38.930
silver again for able gold for Australia

1:09:35.870,1:09:41.120
as the chin and another medal for

1:09:38.930,1:09:44.980
teaming a very Australian celebrating

1:09:41.120,1:09:49.130
what a contest great diving for mr. chin

1:09:44.980,1:09:52.670
hair Sachin taking the gold Jeff able

1:09:49.130,1:09:54.410
with the silver but Hanna Starling who

1:09:52.670,1:09:57.830
looked very good this morning has

1:09:54.410,1:09:59.750
improved her standard the two hundred

1:09:57.830,1:10:01.580
sixteen point nine five she got in the

1:09:59.750,1:10:05.090
end good enough for third place

1:10:01.580,1:10:07.280
edging out Madison kini Aang and Pamela

1:10:05.090,1:10:10.280
where the bronze medalist from last year

1:10:07.280,1:10:12.920
and the world championships her well

1:10:10.280,1:10:16.489
done has darling a major step forward

1:10:12.920,1:10:18.650
for the 19 year old from Leeds but his

1:10:16.489,1:10:22.160
bronze for her Canada will Jennifer able

1:10:18.650,1:10:23.690
getting a silver to add to her gold in

1:10:22.160,1:10:25.880
the one meter but Esther chin looked

1:10:23.690,1:10:29.260
very good in the one looking good in

1:10:25.880,1:10:29.260
three with the gold

1:10:41.489,1:10:47.639
and there's the 7 to 12 only see a blank

1:10:45.150,1:10:50.699
in 7 not being at all well we do wish

1:10:47.639,1:10:53.840

1:43:25.790,1:43:31.310
wave being thrown up there luck by the

1:43:27.530,1:43:32.720
young Indian only 17 years old and this

1:43:31.310,1:43:35.000
is pretty reflective of what he was

1:43:32.720,1:43:37.940
doing the training over he goes get your

1:43:35.000,1:43:39.890
surfboard sight surf is up for short

1:43:37.940,1:43:42.050
wolf

1:43:39.890,1:43:47.600
I cannot say I'm terribly surprised by

1:43:42.050,1:43:50.300
that threes and 2.5 s Ginga is build up

1:43:47.600,1:43:54.290
to this I think I saw maybe one diver

1:43:50.300,1:44:01.160
looked okay bring his bow through point

1:43:54.290,1:44:05.350
a testing and troubling build-up now 14

1:44:01.160,1:44:09.110
year old matthew dixon from plymouth

1:44:05.350,1:44:11.540
great to have him here and great to see

1:44:09.110,1:44:15.800
what he can do on this forward three and

1:44:11.540,1:44:20.330
a half somersaults with pike 3.0 for the

1:44:15.800,1:44:24.290
oh man it's best marks by the way three

1:44:20.330,1:44:27.140
ninety eight point two five boys a

1:44:24.290,1:44:29.630
little bit short at vertical but he does

1:44:27.140,1:44:32.300
get that rip entry bit of a crowd

1:44:29.630,1:44:34.070
favorite here and i'm not surprised just

1:44:32.300,1:44:36.050
tiny his head there's only chest above

1:44:34.070,1:44:38.120
the bars the safety bars up on the ten

1:44:36.050,1:44:39.860
meter as you see clearly is he on the

1:44:38.120,1:44:42.830
replay the judges of course do not see

1:44:39.860,1:44:45.700
the replay yet is award two shorter

1:44:42.830,1:44:49.910
vertical so the marks will reflect that

1:44:45.700,1:44:51.770
forty nine point five formats wears over

1:44:49.910,1:44:54.470
sixty this morning so he said levin

1:44:51.770,1:44:56.180
points down on how he started in the

1:44:54.470,1:45:00.380
prelims

1:44:56.180,1:45:03.140
Chuya we like something other Malaysian

1:45:00.380,1:45:05.240
dive has actually been a bit of a mixed

1:45:03.140,1:45:07.880
bag this week he's really on it he's

1:45:05.240,1:45:09.800
really on it gets big marks he too

1:45:07.880,1:45:14.240
starts with a for three and a half

1:45:09.800,1:45:17.210
somersaults with Mike 3.0 and well the

1:45:14.240,1:45:20.120
divers will do this one to nice from Chu

1:45:17.210,1:45:22.340
Yuri looking for that vertical entry

1:45:20.120,1:45:26.420
splash this and he gets exactly that

1:45:22.340,1:45:27.980
he's a little bit ragged my Julie gets

1:45:26.420,1:45:28.340
hit enough like shape eventually for

1:45:27.980,1:45:30.380
this

1:45:28.340,1:45:32.150
yes form these good he's gonna get

1:45:30.380,1:45:33.530
eighths on that which is excellent I've

1:45:32.150,1:45:35.870
been watching money's on the dive so he

1:45:33.530,1:45:37.580
tends to be a little bit here and there

1:45:35.870,1:45:42.500
but that's a solid start

1:45:37.580,1:45:45.350
72 for to Yui one of two Malaysians in

1:45:42.500,1:45:45.740
the final coach is saying where that can

1:45:45.350,1:45:47.870
improve

1:45:45.740,1:45:52.520
perhaps we can improve for the remaining

1:45:47.870,1:45:54.950
five rounds as well now this man started

1:45:52.520,1:45:56.840
like a train this morning is open and

1:45:54.950,1:45:59.230
dive the arms and back double somersault

1:45:56.840,1:46:04.100
to and I'll twist we're about to see

1:45:59.230,1:46:06.670
look very very impressive see we could

1:46:04.100,1:46:06.670
do with this one

1:46:40.729,1:46:45.050
oh it's nearly as good as the prelim

1:46:42.949,1:46:48.289
that's a huge dive to open with he got

1:46:45.050,1:46:49.729
massive 91 on this in the prelim he

1:46:48.289,1:46:51.650
isn't gonna be far away from that now

1:46:49.729,1:46:53.690
this would get mid-80s some ways three

1:46:51.650,1:46:55.579
point six degree of difficulty he's

1:46:53.690,1:46:57.800
gonna get a little bit too much blast

1:46:55.579,1:47:01.610
being thrown up four nines commonly

1:46:57.800,1:47:09.139
baked goods opens his campaign very good

1:47:01.610,1:47:14.659
dive 86.4 for Dominic bedgood 14 points

1:47:09.139,1:47:20.719
player to Yui Matt Dixon with 49.5 third

1:47:14.659,1:47:23.869
place currently say does Helen looking

1:47:20.719,1:47:27.260
forward to two more English divers to

1:47:23.869,1:47:29.360
come James Denny up in a couple and Tom

1:47:27.260,1:47:33.139
Daly cuz he was the best qualifier this

1:47:29.360,1:47:36.199
morning will go last so here's the thing

1:47:33.139,1:47:39.590
yang now museum formerly of China for

1:47:36.199,1:47:42.079
three and a half well just letting the

1:47:39.590,1:47:43.670
died run away the take off was good

1:47:42.079,1:47:45.709
probably a little bit too much forward

1:47:43.670,1:47:47.119
momentum she moves away from the diving

1:47:45.709,1:47:49.519
board quite considerably

1:47:47.119,1:47:51.349
this can make controlling the die a

1:47:49.519,1:47:52.999
little bit more challenging comes out

1:47:51.349,1:47:54.679
with plenty of time just rolling over

1:47:52.999,1:47:58.039
there a little bit of splash being

1:47:54.679,1:47:59.690
thrown up so 3.0 relatively low degree

1:47:58.039,1:48:02.329
of difficulty compared to some of the

1:47:59.690,1:48:05.780
dives in his repertoire and he's a

1:48:02.329,1:48:09.079
little bit off the pace 58.5 sticks him

1:48:05.780,1:48:11.090
in behind bedgood a strong opening for

1:48:09.079,1:48:14.179
the Australian who you saw as we were

1:48:11.090,1:48:18.070
joining to Yui in second place

1:48:14.179,1:48:21.019
James dedi second of the Englishman

1:48:18.070,1:48:23.090
ninth of the Europeans on the 10-meter

1:48:21.019,1:48:25.429
board went over 400 points whether they

1:48:23.090,1:48:27.800
is the silver medalists on the platform

1:48:25.429,1:48:31.880
and the British Championships earlier

1:48:27.800,1:48:35.329
this year he will start with a 3.2 nice

1:48:31.880,1:48:37.219
opening gambit for James inward three

1:48:35.329,1:48:39.260
and a half somersaults with tuck before

1:48:37.219,1:48:42.130
the second of three Englishmen and you

1:48:39.260,1:48:42.130
know who comes third

1:48:54.330,1:48:58.950
but there's a good stuff on James steady

1:48:56.640,1:49:01.140
really clean on the water just a little

1:48:58.950,1:49:03.300
bit sure this goes in in fact he doesn't

1:49:01.140,1:49:05.400
quite straighten out enough take off his

1:49:03.300,1:49:07.350
good squeeze into that touching three

1:49:05.400,1:49:08.640
and a half somersault pints out has a

1:49:07.350,1:49:10.440
good look at the water but you see them

1:49:08.640,1:49:12.870
he's got his backside sticking out as he

1:49:10.440,1:49:14.190
goes in he won't get more than seven for

1:49:12.870,1:49:15.600
that which is a shame because have you

1:49:14.190,1:49:17.460
to straighten out completely

1:49:15.600,1:49:23.010
he'd have been getting eight maybe even

1:49:17.460,1:49:26.460
more 777th on a 3.2 d D we have D D D

1:49:23.010,1:49:29.739
here Denny Daly and Dixon

1:49:26.460,1:49:29.739
[Music]

1:49:31.659,1:49:38.260
goats in yang malaysia already show what

1:49:36.280,1:49:41.619
he can do on the 3-meter board by going

1:49:38.260,1:49:45.099
on to win it absolutely a few English

1:49:41.619,1:49:48.010
hearts not least of all jackal or from

1:49:45.099,1:49:50.019
three to ten and quite put in the

1:49:48.010,1:49:52.570
performance yet to suggest he's a

1:49:50.019,1:49:54.099
medalist but it's a final now not the

1:49:52.570,1:49:55.539
prelim since we're reading matters back

1:49:54.099,1:49:57.550
two and a half somersaults one and a

1:49:55.539,1:50:01.900
half twists in the pike position three

1:49:57.550,1:50:04.269
point two yet I'm very well this money

1:50:01.900,1:50:06.459
oopsy Liang make one mistake which is

1:50:04.269,1:50:08.650
why he's middle at the pack of divers

1:50:06.459,1:50:11.289
dive in reverse order from these

1:50:08.650,1:50:13.239
standings in the prelim this is good for

1:50:11.289,1:50:15.519
me to see like three point two it's

1:50:13.239,1:50:16.749
actually a relatively easy twist in

1:50:15.519,1:50:19.599
comparison to what you're going to see

1:50:16.749,1:50:20.919
Mitchum Daly and Denny try the back two

1:50:19.599,1:50:22.329
and a half somersaults two and a half

1:50:20.919,1:50:24.369
twist this is a two and a half

1:50:22.329,1:50:29.110
somersaults one and a half twist it's

1:50:24.369,1:50:33.209
worked out okay for boom the marks we

1:50:29.110,1:50:35.169
wait for judges other indecisive or the

1:50:33.209,1:50:36.760
technology is letting us down the most

1:50:35.169,1:50:38.949
so we can't bring you what he's got as

1:50:36.760,1:50:42.459
yet it will be appearing on your screen

1:50:38.949,1:50:44.590
oh no we have a church is not push their

1:50:42.459,1:50:46.479
button properly so they have to re and

1:50:44.590,1:50:49.419
put it before we can bring you all the

1:50:46.479,1:50:51.280
scores remember only the middle three or

1:50:49.419,1:50:54.340
count towards a total seven point five

1:50:51.280,1:50:57.010
and eight do you have a question about

1:50:54.340,1:50:58.449
why all the marks are not counted it's

1:50:57.010,1:51:00.789
about finding the average so the two

1:50:58.449,1:51:02.380
highest and two lowest are discounted to

1:51:00.789,1:51:04.239
get the average scores otherwise the

1:51:02.380,1:51:06.639
subjectivity plays too much of a part

1:51:04.239,1:51:08.860
before the marks count so seven judges

1:51:06.639,1:51:10.389
two highs to lows removed and three

1:51:08.860,1:51:13.689
count multiplied by the degree of

1:51:10.389,1:51:16.389
difficulty QC total before the dive easy

1:51:13.689,1:51:18.639
as that straight forward much more

1:51:16.389,1:51:20.139
straightforward than doing the dives for

1:51:18.639,1:51:23.709
three and a half somersaults with Mike

1:51:20.139,1:51:25.790
for corriendo I was very impressed with

1:51:23.709,1:51:28.550
Vincent we and oh and next

1:51:25.790,1:51:30.740
max Bouchard both of these young

1:51:28.550,1:51:32.960
Canadians brothers vitsin certainly

1:51:30.740,1:51:34.250
young seventeen-years-old got a bright

1:51:32.960,1:51:38.030
future in front of it this is his

1:51:34.250,1:51:41.470
easiest die 3.0 certainly starts his

1:51:38.030,1:51:44.720
campaign off in pretty steady style I

1:51:41.470,1:51:47.300
need six dives six consistently good

1:51:44.720,1:51:49.700
dies to be anywhere near the medals

1:51:47.300,1:51:51.200
let's see this young man gets on well if

1:51:49.700,1:51:52.430
we presume that it will be daily at

1:51:51.200,1:51:54.860
Mitchum going head to head

1:51:52.430,1:51:59.570
somebody needs to claim the bronze could

1:51:54.860,1:52:02.230
easily be Vincent Rando just come out of

1:51:59.570,1:52:05.900
World Juniors Meireles 10th in Australia

1:52:02.230,1:52:08.270
Maxime Bouchard retired after 2008 World

1:52:05.900,1:52:10.580
Juniors in Germany didn't think you

1:52:08.270,1:52:12.320
could cut the mustard but it's been

1:52:10.580,1:52:14.150
persuaded to come back he said kind of

1:52:12.320,1:52:16.880
held together but was sticky tape for

1:52:14.150,1:52:19.880
some metal in that body arm stand back

1:52:16.880,1:52:21.530
triple somersault with tuck three point

1:52:19.880,1:52:25.850
three they'll be different variances of

1:52:21.530,1:52:29.080
the arm Stan will see some people like

1:52:25.850,1:52:32.680
to do it with a towel some people do not

1:52:29.080,1:52:32.680
Maxime is one of those

1:52:44.680,1:52:48.650
well my who was because he wasn't meant

1:52:48.020,1:52:49.970
to do that

1:52:48.650,1:52:53.120
and a little bit of a wobble in the arm

1:52:49.970,1:52:55.370
stand balance there lost his balance

1:52:53.120,1:52:58.100
manages to hold himself but then when it

1:52:55.370,1:52:59.750
goes eventually his take off isn't quite

1:52:58.100,1:53:00.800
as strong as it normally is and so as he

1:52:59.750,1:53:03.410
exits the die

1:53:00.800,1:53:05.960
he thinks he's lower to the water arches

1:53:03.410,1:53:08.960
through to try and pull it in but it's

1:53:05.960,1:53:11.390
an error and he over rotates it's not

1:53:08.960,1:53:14.140
disastrous but it was as strong as I've

1:53:11.390,1:53:16.460
seen in training from blacks Emmett

1:53:14.140,1:53:19.220
ended an event and a competition of this

1:53:16.460,1:53:21.710
quality anything below sevens is not

1:53:19.220,1:53:23.240
going to help your middle prospects 6.5

1:53:21.710,1:53:27.380
just puts him a little bit behind the

1:53:23.240,1:53:30.880
base in round one behind ed good good

1:53:27.380,1:53:38.630
saintly act qu UE Vincent Brando and

1:53:30.880,1:53:41.620
James Denny only have Lee Dixon but Lee

1:53:38.630,1:53:44.990
Dixon obviously and Lee and Dixon

1:53:41.620,1:53:46.820
something is diving yet so a new bearing

1:53:44.990,1:53:49.460
of Gary Lineker and Lee Dixon on the

1:53:46.820,1:53:53.620
board a little chat with the Canadian

1:53:49.460,1:53:53.620
coach about something there leo

1:53:54.840,1:54:01.020
yeah let's wait and see I don't have any

1:53:59.730,1:54:08.990
microphones down there that was the

1:54:01.020,1:54:08.990
referee it was a discussion

1:54:09.050,1:54:13.120
no idea what was discussed

1:54:13.280,1:54:16.770
protests do you need to make protests

1:54:15.360,1:54:18.030
straight away that maybe the left we

1:54:16.770,1:54:20.070
turned it down we'll find out afterwards

1:54:18.030,1:54:21.840
so there's a little disruption now the

1:54:20.070,1:54:24.420
competition really starts the

1:54:21.840,1:54:27.150
head-to-head Mitchum versus Daley take

1:54:24.420,1:54:29.370
two four years ago it was daily there

1:54:27.150,1:54:31.830
will it be this evening well I'll try

1:54:29.370,1:54:34.020
and do four remember is give you their

1:54:31.830,1:54:36.720
marks this morning so you can compare

1:54:34.020,1:54:38.280
how they've done to my 81 on the for

1:54:36.720,1:54:43.200
three and a half somersaults for Matt

1:54:38.280,1:54:45.240
Mitcham this morning oh there you go the

1:54:43.200,1:54:47.820
pressure beginning to tell did the delay

1:54:45.240,1:54:50.040
caused him to lose concentration because

1:54:47.820,1:54:54.000
that is ever for Mitchum his easiest

1:54:50.040,1:54:57.270
died and he's fluffed in their door is

1:54:54.000,1:55:00.720
wide open you cannot start your campaign

1:54:57.270,1:55:02.880
with like a sixty pointer not when

1:55:00.720,1:55:05.460
you're taking on Tom Daley what are we

1:55:02.880,1:55:08.700
going to see this evening six point five

1:55:05.460,1:55:10.830
s is what you see there and that is some

1:55:08.700,1:55:13.920
twenty three points down and what he did

1:55:10.830,1:55:16.530
this morning it's already a big amount

1:55:13.920,1:55:19.110
of ground to make up for the gold

1:55:16.530,1:55:21.960
medalist from Beijing 2008 so man

1:55:19.110,1:55:24.450
there's four years ago in Delhi and the

1:55:21.960,1:55:26.850
winner on the synchro last night we're

1:55:24.450,1:55:29.910
done with it bit good so Tom Daley

1:55:26.850,1:55:31.680
I'm stand to start slightly different

1:55:29.910,1:55:31.980
version of it from what we've seen thus

1:55:31.680,1:55:35.310
far

1:55:31.980,1:55:36.630
um stand back triple somersault now when

1:55:35.310,1:55:39.900
he performed this dive in the

1:55:36.630,1:55:41.760
preliminaries this morning seventy three

1:55:39.900,1:55:45.390
point five zero just give you a little

1:55:41.760,1:55:48.270
heads up the div' has a problem with is

1:55:45.390,1:55:51.060
coming next seventy three point five

1:55:48.270,1:55:53.450
though boys arm stand back triple this

1:55:51.060,1:55:53.450
morning

1:55:58.059,1:56:06.070
hello Tom Tali welcome to the men's 10

1:56:02.829,1:56:09.670
metre platform final this is a defending

1:56:06.070,1:56:12.309
champion that is his first dive and he's

1:56:09.670,1:56:15.219
gonna get nine so maybe even some tens

1:56:12.309,1:56:18.219
he has capitalized on mitchum leaving

1:56:15.219,1:56:22.980
the door open Tom Daley is absolutely

1:56:18.219,1:56:27.130
smashed it 90 points plus beautiful tie

1:56:22.980,1:56:30.400
game on should we just stop the

1:56:27.130,1:56:32.199
competition there 94.5 compared to

1:56:30.400,1:56:36.369
seventy three point five what a massive

1:56:32.199,1:56:39.750
swing 23 points down mitchum 21 points

1:56:36.369,1:56:42.429
up daily swinger 44 points on one dive

1:56:39.750,1:56:46.659
from this morning to evening and there

1:56:42.429,1:56:49.659
it is you don't even see Matthew bitch

1:56:46.659,1:56:51.969
up in the frame there is on page 2

1:56:49.659,1:56:54.460
that's good sterling well again for

1:56:51.969,1:56:55.989
Australia would say Liang qu he we're

1:56:54.460,1:56:59.170
having problems with a photography

1:56:55.989,1:57:01.989
problem that we had in London everyone

1:56:59.170,1:57:04.570
to get a snapshot of Tom Daly and we

1:57:01.989,1:57:06.610
know how affected this diving in London

1:57:04.570,1:57:10.179
so the ground just being told to turn

1:57:06.610,1:57:12.369
those flashes off Tom Daly has a lead of

1:57:10.179,1:57:16.630
8 points already and maybe more

1:57:12.369,1:57:19.929
importantly has a lead of some 36 over

1:57:16.630,1:57:21.400
Matt Mitcham after round 1 now a little

1:57:19.929,1:57:23.380
bit concern for this young man because

1:57:21.400,1:57:25.539
we saw in practice tonight the trading

1:57:23.380,1:57:27.789
warm up and he wasn't getting anything

1:57:25.539,1:57:30.340
right let's hope it gets through his six

1:57:27.789,1:57:32.349
unscathed inward three and a half

1:57:30.340,1:57:34.150
somersaults with tuck for siddhartha

1:57:32.349,1:57:38.070
deshi this is his big dive of the

1:57:34.150,1:57:38.070
program at 3.2

1:57:46.479,1:57:51.309
well Siddhartha was well he was almost

1:57:49.420,1:57:55.510
there all the components where the right

1:57:51.309,1:57:57.070
places take off is it's good enough good

1:57:55.510,1:57:58.690
jump good extension from the legs moving

1:57:57.070,1:58:00.429
or safe distance from the diving board

1:57:58.690,1:58:02.469
spots the water just isn't quite

1:58:00.429,1:58:05.199
confident enough to straighten out quick

1:58:02.469,1:58:07.690
enough he still hits the water a little

1:58:05.199,1:58:09.400
bit loose a little bit soft and

1:58:07.690,1:58:11.889
therefore won't get more than the marks

1:58:09.400,1:58:13.809
coming up five 5.5 s is about right if

1:58:11.889,1:58:16.690
he was a bit more confident on the exit

1:58:13.809,1:58:18.159
the dive you can get sevens are beads to

1:58:16.690,1:58:19.869
see what he does in the remain dives

1:58:18.159,1:58:22.389
because when he was doing this morning

1:58:19.869,1:58:23.650
taking about 25 30 seconds over each

1:58:22.389,1:58:26.170
time but it seemed to be

1:58:23.650,1:58:28.659
counterproductive he was trying to get

1:58:26.170,1:58:31.300
himself prepared for it seem to be too

1:58:28.659,1:58:32.880
much thinking and execution of the dives

1:58:31.300,1:58:36.059
who were suffering because of it

1:58:32.880,1:58:40.030
14-year old Matt Dixon

1:58:36.059,1:58:41.650
well the European juniors now stepping

1:58:40.030,1:58:43.119
up to the senior ranks with a reverse

1:58:41.650,1:58:44.499
two and a half somersaults with tuck

1:58:43.119,1:58:46.869
only two point eight degree of

1:58:44.499,1:58:49.079
difficulty so Sims are keeping up with

1:58:46.869,1:58:52.619
the others this needs to be very good

1:58:49.079,1:58:52.619
for the young man

1:58:57.040,1:59:03.730
oh I said tremendous entry into the

1:58:59.500,1:59:04.540
water he's just a little bit untidy as

1:59:03.730,1:59:06.160
he gets in

1:59:04.540,1:59:08.650
I'll talk you through it on the replay

1:59:06.160,1:59:10.960
the jump is good only tiny is he 14

1:59:08.650,1:59:12.910
years old spots awards and kinks I look

1:59:10.960,1:59:15.010
so his toes reaches back just tips his

1:59:12.910,1:59:16.570
feet over with him so he got eight Nahas

1:59:15.010,1:59:19.270
on this early I think this loan he gets

1:59:16.570,1:59:21.160
seven in a heart but he's loving this

1:59:19.270,1:59:24.280
fine I did a little bit of a wiggle and

1:59:21.160,1:59:28.060
a waddle on the way in so yeah 7.5 s

1:59:24.280,1:59:31.780
alright middle of the back in terms of

1:59:28.060,1:59:33.160
marks its strength on the board is no

1:59:31.780,1:59:35.350
question is strength in terms of getting

1:59:33.160,1:59:40.150
the door open to go to the war the

1:59:35.350,1:59:41.950
cooldown area might be qu you eat comes

1:59:40.150,1:59:46.480
other arm stance different to the one we

1:59:41.950,1:59:48.820
saw from Tom Daley this one has a double

1:59:46.480,1:59:51.490
somersault one and a half twists

1:59:48.820,1:59:54.450
attached to it was his dive done by

1:59:51.490,1:59:58.090
would say Niang and by corriendo and

1:59:54.450,1:59:59.950
also by Mitchum in this round three

1:59:58.090,2:00:04.680
point two degree of difficulty qu e

1:59:59.950,2:00:04.680
after round one is in fourth place

2:00:10.489,2:00:16.790
nice from to Yui sometimes struggles

2:00:15.200,2:00:18.320
with this form the form of this type is

2:00:16.790,2:00:21.110
good you looking for legs straight toes

2:00:18.320,2:00:21.590
pointed aesthetically pleasing movements

2:00:21.110,2:00:24.890
ie

2:00:21.590,2:00:26.780
look pretty impress the judges his Pike

2:00:24.890,2:00:29.540
shape isn't quite as deep as it needs to

2:00:26.780,2:00:31.130
be so he's swinging around looking a

2:00:29.540,2:00:33.830
little bit out of control as he squares

2:00:31.130,2:00:35.570
up so the judges yeah I'm not sure which

2:00:33.830,2:00:37.460
way they're gonna go with it well a

2:00:35.570,2:00:38.950
couple well six to seven and a half so

2:00:37.460,2:00:42.469
yeah but sure I though they weren't

2:00:38.950,2:00:44.060
completes mixed bag of scores luckily

2:00:42.469,2:00:46.520
just go match all you're saying earlier

2:00:44.060,2:00:49.190
on we do to scan the top ones and the

2:00:46.520,2:00:50.719
bottom ones just the middle three will

2:00:49.190,2:00:52.390
be included in that score

2:00:50.719,2:00:57.680
and for the time being at least with

2:00:52.390,2:00:59.710
still queries ago he's leading 139 that

2:00:57.680,2:01:02.719
will not last for long probably be

2:00:59.710,2:01:05.300
overtaken on this diver though after a

2:01:02.719,2:01:07.870
great start this morning don't think

2:01:05.300,2:01:11.360
they'd be good have problems with this

2:01:07.870,2:01:13.460
second after round one his inward three

2:01:11.360,2:01:15.980
and a half somersaults three point two

2:01:13.460,2:01:19.090
for the first of the Australians will

2:01:15.980,2:01:19.090
see Mitchum being the other

2:01:21.559,2:01:27.349
yeah was about good this morning that is

2:01:23.960,2:01:30.079
better it can still be improved because

2:01:27.349,2:01:31.670
all the hard work the take off is very

2:01:30.079,2:01:34.219
very strong squeezing it to the touch

2:01:31.670,2:01:35.659
tape completes the dive very easily just

2:01:34.219,2:01:37.460
doesn't quite straighten this body out

2:01:35.659,2:01:39.860
on the end if he straightens out he

2:01:37.460,2:01:42.829
could even get as high as nines because

2:01:39.860,2:01:46.340
he's going in slightly rounded shall we

2:01:42.829,2:01:48.320
say he's only gonna get that 7.5 gold

2:01:46.340,2:01:51.530
medalist with Matt Mitcham last night in

2:01:48.320,2:01:54.949
the 10-meter synchro okay trying to add

2:01:51.530,2:01:57.020
to his collection but probably the

2:01:54.949,2:01:58.849
moment on that form gonna be in the top

2:01:57.020,2:02:01.190
three shaker but there's such big

2:01:58.849,2:02:02.719
tariffs attached to the dives that come

2:02:01.190,2:02:06.079
later which was about three point six is

2:02:02.719,2:02:08.210
a lot of them 3.7 s3 men doing the

2:02:06.079,2:02:11.510
forward four and a half which is 3.7

2:02:08.210,2:02:13.670
this is a miniscule in comparison 3.2

2:02:11.510,2:02:16.130
for leaf and yang of New Zealand inward

2:02:13.670,2:02:18.489
three and a half one more time in the

2:02:16.130,2:02:18.489
tuck position

2:02:20.799,2:02:27.999
yep did sir he makes that guy so easily

2:02:24.579,2:02:29.499
3.2 is still very very challenging lots

2:02:27.999,2:02:31.539
can go wrong you've got to jump away

2:02:29.499,2:02:34.599
from the diving board he is a safe

2:02:31.539,2:02:37.839
distance yeah Heights out of that very

2:02:34.599,2:02:39.609
early but then feels - so he's stuck

2:02:37.839,2:02:41.769
and so ducks is chilling it just rolls

2:02:39.609,2:02:46.029
over so he won't be getting AIDS he'll

2:02:41.769,2:02:49.569
be getting 7s sixty seven point two

2:02:46.029,2:02:51.309
seven seven and seven so hard towards a

2:02:49.569,2:02:52.989
total if you are new to all this and OH

2:02:51.309,2:02:54.279
although those of you been with us all

2:02:52.989,2:02:56.529
week probably think we'll we know this

2:02:54.279,2:02:58.719
by now but it is the degree of

2:02:56.529,2:03:03.579
difficulty multiplied by the scores that

2:02:58.719,2:03:04.539
count add up to that total score team

2:03:03.579,2:03:07.839
Tom Daley do it

2:03:04.539,2:03:10.479
can you see James Deli do it now the arm

2:03:07.839,2:03:14.559
stand back triple somersaults putting

2:03:10.479,2:03:18.849
sixty seven point two zero for James

2:03:14.559,2:03:23.709
Deli silver medal in the platform of

2:03:18.849,2:03:25.829
Cinco last night role model is Jenson

2:03:23.709,2:03:25.829
Button

2:03:26.940,2:03:31.199
nope it stopped here for James Danny

2:03:38.420,2:03:43.050
yeah it's good it's good all the way

2:03:40.740,2:03:45.600
until the entry so James

2:03:43.050,2:03:47.490
steady balance strong push off the hands

2:03:45.600,2:03:50.340
flicking the legs squeezing into the

2:03:47.490,2:03:52.860
tongue shape and just here Missy goes

2:03:50.340,2:03:55.140
into the water just allowing his feet to

2:03:52.860,2:03:56.940
tip over with him given the impression

2:03:55.140,2:03:58.590
the dive is going over but really just

2:03:56.940,2:04:00.270
needed to extend a little bit more

2:03:58.590,2:04:05.400
pointless toes back towards the diving

2:04:00.270,2:04:07.260
board to stay vertical minor error just

2:04:05.400,2:04:11.340
communicates with the coach ATH get

2:04:07.260,2:04:14.160
there from the leads diving Club six

2:04:11.340,2:04:17.010
point five to that total of sixty four

2:04:14.160,2:04:21.390
point three five good ahead of him to

2:04:17.010,2:04:23.910
Yui ahead of him and arrive as I follow

2:04:21.390,2:04:26.880
at least a bronze melt and he won't be

2:04:23.910,2:04:32.220
seeing daily Mitchum was invincible ears

2:04:26.880,2:04:35.310
would say Liang of Malaysia see on stand

2:04:32.220,2:04:37.440
time right this way no I just as those

2:04:35.310,2:04:41.010
bit on the arm stand divers think it's

2:04:37.440,2:04:44.460
nothing to speak of I don't see much

2:04:41.010,2:04:48.390
mere mortals do find it quite a tricky

2:04:44.460,2:04:50.250
thing to watch arm stand back double

2:04:48.390,2:04:55.370
somersault one half twists in a free

2:04:50.250,2:04:55.370
position third after round one

2:05:00.079,2:05:03.679
well Lucy go and leaving the dive

2:05:02.030,2:05:06.380
marginally short vertigo though he

2:05:03.679,2:05:07.579
enters the water steady our pilot is

2:05:06.380,2:05:09.949
great isn't it when you get the camera

2:05:07.579,2:05:12.409
to zoom in just to see the concentration

2:05:09.949,2:05:14.179
and the effort that goes into these

2:05:12.409,2:05:16.219
dives the judges of course do not see

2:05:14.179,2:05:18.650
the replay their marks are already in

2:05:16.219,2:05:21.650
the computer Bootsy Liang's short

2:05:18.650,2:05:25.010
vertical only gonna get sinks and a

2:05:21.650,2:05:27.650
half's Wow will that be good enough to

2:05:25.010,2:05:29.510
stay in contention at the medals not

2:05:27.650,2:05:31.520
likely with Mitchum and Davy still to

2:05:29.510,2:05:32.119
come and indeed we know in a very good

2:05:31.520,2:05:34.070
start

2:05:32.119,2:05:36.469
so although he's third right now that

2:05:34.070,2:05:37.699
could easily be sick or possibly seventh

2:05:36.469,2:05:40.280
on the end of this round there will be a

2:05:37.699,2:05:44.239
lot of fluctuations in position but this

2:05:40.280,2:05:48.020
young man very very impressive star is

2:05:44.239,2:05:49.670
definitely future star of Canadian dye

2:05:48.020,2:05:52.010
me there's no riding McCormick now he's

2:05:49.670,2:05:54.230
retired from 10 music I'm down to three

2:05:52.010,2:05:57.349
and one so they're looking for a new

2:05:54.230,2:06:00.139
start see how that state party in the

2:05:57.349,2:06:02.780
past on that 10 and 3 perhaps

2:06:00.139,2:06:05.570
here's his heir apparent Vincent flurry

2:06:02.780,2:06:07.219
and alt arm stand back double somersault

2:06:05.570,2:06:11.090
one and a half twists in the free

2:06:07.219,2:06:13.950
position but he goes and dine he goes

2:06:11.090,2:06:13.970
that's really really tidy

2:06:13.950,2:06:16.380
[Applause]

2:06:13.970,2:06:19.110
[Music]

2:06:16.380,2:06:20.849
good strong push off the hands pops up

2:06:19.110,2:06:21.690
into the air that's really tight his

2:06:20.849,2:06:23.040
feet actually come quite close

2:06:21.690,2:06:26.670
underneath the tower it needs to be

2:06:23.040,2:06:29.130
careful of that it does lose his feet

2:06:26.670,2:06:31.320
helicopter feet marginally so it's been

2:06:29.130,2:06:33.840
kind of flutter so the judges might if

2:06:31.320,2:06:35.639
they spot that penalize one judge has to

2:06:33.840,2:06:38.219
judge number three giving him a six the

2:06:35.639,2:06:42.540
others ignoring or missing the feet

2:06:38.219,2:06:43.940
flutter I like a feet flutter but I

2:06:42.540,2:06:47.720
never will

2:06:43.940,2:06:51.080
7.5 will count towards the total Maxime

2:06:47.720,2:06:54.020
Bouchard was happy to be with us after

2:06:51.080,2:06:55.460
the problems he's been through for three

2:06:54.020,2:06:59.150
and a half seven sort with pike for the

2:06:55.460,2:07:01.640
canadian yes nice tidy straight

2:06:59.150,2:07:02.150
up-and-down clean vertical entry into

2:07:01.640,2:07:04.490
the water

2:07:02.150,2:07:07.580
sweet points zero degree of difficulty

2:07:04.490,2:07:09.890
so you know what he sometimes well he's

2:07:07.580,2:07:11.840
gonna be in the mix for the bronze and

2:07:09.890,2:07:13.820
he's diving very well that's gonna nudge

2:07:11.840,2:07:19.780
over 70 points which is great because

2:07:13.820,2:07:22.940
it's only 3.0 degree of difficulty 8

2:07:19.780,2:07:24.680
across the board you'll see an 8.5 there

2:07:22.940,2:07:26.780
but discount that sand because it is

2:07:24.680,2:07:29.450
discarded only three marks the ones

2:07:26.780,2:07:32.240
without the line through them will add

2:07:29.450,2:07:35.990
up okay I'd say I try and tell you what

2:07:32.240,2:07:38.570
the team main two divers got this

2:07:35.990,2:07:41.480
morning well this was a seventy five

2:07:38.570,2:07:45.050
point six for Matthew Mitchell but as we

2:07:41.480,2:07:48.410
mentioned spent 23 points swing against

2:07:45.050,2:07:50.030
him and Tom Daly got 21 more points on

2:07:48.410,2:07:52.730
his opening dive he did this morning so

2:07:50.030,2:07:55.760
a big margin to make up already for

2:07:52.730,2:07:59.210
Mitchum on his arm stand back double

2:07:55.760,2:08:02.170
somersault two and a half twists 99 will

2:07:59.210,2:08:05.320
take you into the lead not likely

2:08:02.170,2:08:05.320
or is it

2:08:09.989,2:08:15.090
it's beautiful our balance he is cranked

2:08:13.230,2:08:17.520
the start a little bit too much he

2:08:15.090,2:08:18.600
giving too much beans and could not stop

2:08:17.520,2:08:21.300
that rotation

2:08:18.600,2:08:23.760
it's a tricky dive to do it many times

2:08:21.300,2:08:25.830
it's just a real pain because you've got

2:08:23.760,2:08:27.660
so many twists to do to get in with a

2:08:25.830,2:08:29.550
rotation it's very easy to over rotate

2:08:27.660,2:08:33.750
that's exactly what Mitchum's done

2:08:29.550,2:08:36.360
he is lagging behind now this could

2:08:33.750,2:08:39.950
prove to be critical dropped another 12

2:08:36.360,2:08:44.610
from this morning Daly's next dive is

2:08:39.950,2:08:47.430
crucial we've used a description before

2:08:44.610,2:08:52.380
a few times and he would describe it to

2:08:47.430,2:08:55.260
as his bogey dive is the description of

2:08:52.380,2:08:56.850
it back two and a half somersaults two

2:08:55.260,2:08:58.140
and a half twists in the pike positions

2:08:56.850,2:09:03.030
worth three point six degree of

2:08:58.140,2:09:05.070
difficulty who's down in 37 s 2030 7.8

2:09:03.030,2:09:11.090
that's why was a huge swing to Mitchum

2:09:05.070,2:09:13.830
in election terms this compose himself

2:09:11.090,2:09:15.840
take a long time over this just look at

2:09:13.830,2:09:18.890
the mannerisms and the facial

2:09:15.840,2:09:18.890
expressions on this one

2:09:22.929,2:09:26.920
oh it's better than this morning it's

2:09:25.060,2:09:29.199
better than this morning's they all

2:09:26.920,2:09:31.810
struggle with it that is a step in the

2:09:29.199,2:09:33.909
right direction it's a step in the right

2:09:31.810,2:09:36.070
direction but it's not as good as he did

2:09:33.909,2:09:37.989
in Mexico he's not extending his legs

2:09:36.070,2:09:39.969
out of the diving board the judges are

2:09:37.989,2:09:42.969
going to give him success because he

2:09:39.969,2:09:44.469
just anita 11 meets a platform forget to

2:09:42.969,2:09:46.090
take off like that he just needs to

2:09:44.469,2:09:48.460
extend the legs but the problem is at

2:09:46.090,2:09:50.739
the start he's not quite as relaxed as

2:09:48.460,2:09:53.040
he needs to be he's watching the replay

2:09:50.739,2:09:55.270
there the judges don't see the replay

2:09:53.040,2:09:57.370
64y well that's out of the way no time

2:09:55.270,2:10:00.699
for more dives if you want the gold it's

2:09:57.370,2:10:02.770
yours to take and even though wasn't up

2:10:00.699,2:10:05.320
to spec enough to scratch for Daly

2:10:02.770,2:10:09.159
it's still a massive swing to him from

2:10:05.320,2:10:11.560
Matt Mitcham again 37 this morning 64 in

2:10:09.159,2:10:14.140
the evening daily leads from bed good

2:10:11.560,2:10:17.080
and to Yui there one two three members

2:10:14.140,2:10:19.929
James Denny on the second page as is

2:10:17.080,2:10:26.230
Matthew Dixon in 10 and sit up at their

2:10:19.929,2:10:28.449
shoes next in 11 o'clock I live here

2:10:26.230,2:10:31.860
because he takes longer over this dive

2:10:28.449,2:10:33.760
and does Ruffin the dowel over a serve

2:10:31.860,2:10:36.929
something like half a minute this

2:10:33.760,2:10:40.230
morning so right he's ready to go

2:10:36.929,2:10:40.230
stopwatch on

2:11:06.250,2:11:12.050
well according to my timekeeper 28

2:11:09.140,2:11:14.600
seconds thinking about it but only 1.5

2:11:12.050,2:11:16.310
seconds to complete the dive or 1.8 so

2:11:14.600,2:11:18.200
back two and a half in the pipe position

2:11:16.310,2:11:20.600
this is Hadley very good for the setup

2:11:18.200,2:11:23.000
in training he was everywhere suede but

2:11:20.600,2:11:25.760
upright in in the time when he counts in

2:11:23.000,2:11:29.270
the competition he's nailed it

2:11:25.760,2:11:33.800
demand from India lands up by vertical

2:11:29.270,2:11:36.200
and good ii won't dive well this morning

2:11:33.800,2:11:39.620
it didn't work for him the length of

2:11:36.200,2:11:43.220
time he was cogitating but that worked

2:11:39.620,2:11:44.450
alright and once he's not gonna be in

2:11:43.220,2:11:46.040
the top ten the way things are looking

2:11:44.450,2:11:50.090
it's trying to get as many marks as he

2:11:46.040,2:11:52.210
can huge cheer for the young man who

2:11:50.090,2:11:54.590
really does seem to be relishing a

2:11:52.210,2:11:56.030
chance of performing in front of this

2:11:54.590,2:12:00.200
audience and the huge audience at home

2:11:56.030,2:12:01.760
14 years of age from Plymouth bronze at

2:12:00.200,2:12:04.100
the European juniors and British

2:12:01.760,2:12:11.320
Championships a year was very close to

2:12:04.100,2:12:13.880
400 marks for gymnasts now divert that

2:12:11.320,2:12:18.200
dickson arm stand forward double

2:12:13.880,2:12:21.410
somersault one twist 3.1 already can see

2:12:18.200,2:12:24.280
the strappy on his arm the battering

2:12:21.410,2:12:24.280
that I was taking

2:12:25.689,2:12:32.050
oh it's a great take officer so composed

2:12:29.650,2:12:33.459
so balanced beautiful I understand you

2:12:32.050,2:12:35.139
can seize gymnastics background here

2:12:33.459,2:12:37.659
this is almost like a vault you to NASA

2:12:35.139,2:12:39.849
home you'll notice what needs to go in

2:12:37.659,2:12:42.309
to get that forward rotation from a

2:12:39.849,2:12:45.459
handstand without having a a springboard

2:12:42.309,2:12:47.110
in a vault to get off just faltering on

2:12:45.459,2:12:48.550
the edge into the water it cranks it a

2:12:47.110,2:12:53.590
little bit too much and it's over he

2:12:48.550,2:12:56.349
goes for the time-being into the lead he

2:12:53.590,2:12:58.659
goes but as he's only the second one up

2:12:56.349,2:13:03.340
that's not gonna last very long but 50

2:12:58.659,2:13:06.030
1.15 brilliance immense and not

2:13:03.340,2:13:09.059
repeatable in terms of his age

2:13:06.030,2:13:13.630
experience for the young man from Leeds

2:13:09.059,2:13:16.840
now Hughie or Malaysia they place the

2:13:13.630,2:13:18.749
mode nice and solid opening a couple of

2:13:16.840,2:13:21.610
round dives

2:13:18.749,2:13:23.439
this one will be performed in the Tuck

2:13:21.610,2:13:25.329
position three point three it's a great

2:13:23.439,2:13:27.610
difficulty we will get up into the 3.6

2:13:25.329,2:13:29.439
is very shortly and the three points

2:13:27.610,2:13:33.159
Evans Mitchum fish is with two three

2:13:29.439,2:13:34.869
point six is dr. Lee has that forward

2:13:33.159,2:13:36.880
four and a half worth three point seven

2:13:34.869,2:13:40.439
but this is a back three and a half

2:13:36.880,2:13:40.439
somersaults for Choo you eat

2:13:46.280,2:13:52.450
or what a mess what a shame

2:13:50.060,2:13:54.410
faltering as he went into the water

2:13:52.450,2:13:56.640
[Applause]

2:13:54.410,2:13:58.530
drifting too far away from the diving

2:13:56.640,2:13:59.670
board which means that when you come out

2:13:58.530,2:14:02.250
of the dive it's difficult to control

2:13:59.670,2:14:05.240
and over egos that's our second or third

2:14:02.250,2:14:06.950
surfboard moment of this competition

2:14:05.240,2:14:09.750
tidal wave

2:14:06.950,2:14:13.260
incoming there we go splash moving away

2:14:09.750,2:14:21.870
from the diving board judge 3 was Simon

2:14:13.260,2:14:22.760
Cowell judge - well sorry in a

2:14:21.870,2:14:26.049
completely different way

2:14:22.760,2:14:26.049
[Music]

2:14:27.750,2:14:32.260
donut bed good master don't mean died

2:14:30.940,2:14:35.409
we'd love to repeat that six times

2:14:32.260,2:14:38.980
because that's been spot-on for him so

2:14:35.409,2:14:41.170
far today this is kind of waste program

2:14:38.980,2:14:46.570
just unfolded a little bit in the

2:14:41.170,2:14:49.330
prelims Dominic bedgood currently in

2:14:46.570,2:14:51.550
second place they're back three and a

2:14:49.330,2:14:54.070
half somersaults we're tuck the man who

2:14:51.550,2:14:59.650
set a moment putting the pressure on Tom

2:14:54.070,2:15:03.760
Daley well that is exactly the same as

2:14:59.650,2:15:06.730
to UE he went surfing on the bottom way

2:15:03.760,2:15:09.520
over just showing how difficult these

2:15:06.730,2:15:11.170
dives are and this is the time you need

2:15:09.520,2:15:18.640
to get your surfboards out there's the

2:15:11.170,2:15:21.060
wave nobody bet good give us a wave they

2:15:18.640,2:15:21.060
just did

2:15:21.640,2:15:28.740
threes 3.5 s and Williams look at medals

2:15:25.750,2:15:31.780
just now it's gonna have a big

2:15:28.740,2:15:34.450
reparation job to do after that deadly

2:15:31.780,2:15:36.280
three marks total that's gonna slip him

2:15:34.450,2:15:38.770
well down the Becky oh dear one two

2:15:36.280,2:15:41.320
three four five six seven more to go

2:15:38.770,2:15:45.070
at least we go from second down into

2:15:41.320,2:15:49.750
seventh place here must be eight the Fen

2:15:45.070,2:15:51.610
yang of New Zealand 3.30 see yeah like

2:15:49.750,2:15:53.350
three divers all duis and slightly

2:15:51.610,2:15:54.730
different varieties the next two divers

2:15:53.350,2:15:57.130
do it in slightly different varieties of

2:15:54.730,2:15:59.890
this back three and a half seven sorts

2:15:57.130,2:16:04.810
with tuck next diver James Denny will do

2:15:59.890,2:16:08.140
it in the pike position oh that's good

2:16:04.810,2:16:10.810
from Lee that's how you do it so to Yui

2:16:08.140,2:16:14.110
and Dominic but good went surfing and

2:16:10.810,2:16:17.350
leave has disappeared without a rip

2:16:14.110,2:16:19.900
entry just got his boots on there these

2:16:17.350,2:16:22.150
feet are flat and then eventually points

2:16:19.900,2:16:24.250
his toes good I cheated the water Martin

2:16:22.150,2:16:26.170
Lee short vertical but much much better

2:16:24.250,2:16:28.270
it's the best to be back three and a

2:16:26.170,2:16:31.590
half's in the tough position we've just

2:16:28.270,2:16:34.030
seen three in a row even at this stage

2:16:31.590,2:16:37.330
the minor medals are definitely up for

2:16:34.030,2:16:39.250
grabs Tom Daley needs to keep the

2:16:37.330,2:16:42.120
consistency going for the gold because

2:16:39.250,2:16:44.710
he's gonna be untouchable if he does but

2:16:42.120,2:16:48.219
silver and bronze not out of the range

2:16:44.710,2:16:50.920
of anybody in the top order of the

2:16:48.219,2:16:54.730
moment including this young man James

2:16:50.920,2:16:57.550
Denny go with the same time we've seen

2:16:54.730,2:17:02.380
but in a slightly different form go some

2:16:57.550,2:17:04.750
tuck to pike he's next time by the way

2:17:02.380,2:17:06.910
there's one that I've seen on YouTube no

2:17:04.750,2:17:10.390
splash but it's gonna be very hard for

2:17:06.910,2:17:15.130
this to be splash 'less back three and a

2:17:10.390,2:17:17.580
half Pike big taraf three point six for

2:17:15.130,2:17:17.580
James Denny

2:17:17.889,2:17:22.090
well that's what Hitler Tom one of the

2:17:20.409,2:17:24.729
dives that used the last night in the

2:17:22.090,2:17:25.869
sick crow and James doing the opposite

2:17:24.729,2:17:28.329
to what he did in the sinker and the

2:17:25.869,2:17:31.149
Sicari went over over a vertical here

2:17:28.329,2:17:33.369
he's slightly short in fact he is quite

2:17:31.149,2:17:36.189
short Who am I trying to kid he's

2:17:33.369,2:17:38.409
landing pretty much on the backs of his

2:17:36.189,2:17:39.969
legs going loose in the low back is such

2:17:38.409,2:17:44.229
a difficult dive but when it goes wrong

2:17:39.969,2:17:46.629
it can go drastically wrong it will drop

2:17:44.229,2:17:49.029
down the leaderboard without one well

2:17:46.629,2:17:50.469
from Lee everybody else is having

2:17:49.029,2:17:51.510
problems with our dive in different

2:17:50.469,2:17:55.689
configurations

2:17:51.510,2:17:57.999
he blew in James Denny 48.6 and more and

2:17:55.689,2:17:59.979
more it's looking like it's not gonna be

2:17:57.999,2:18:04.059
as much pressure as we thought on Tom

2:17:59.979,2:18:06.309
Daley but certainly Aang was there are

2:18:04.059,2:18:08.469
they're about but he had a four-second

2:18:06.309,2:18:10.090
Ryan dive so he needs to get it back on

2:18:08.469,2:18:16.149
track with a four three and a half

2:18:10.090,2:18:19.239
the pike that is back on track is very

2:18:16.149,2:18:21.909
good for mood Sealy I his easiest dive

2:18:19.239,2:18:24.309
3.0 forward three and a half in the pike

2:18:21.909,2:18:25.449
position such as strong athlete leaps

2:18:24.309,2:18:27.639
off the diving board

2:18:25.449,2:18:29.849
she asked rolling into the water he's

2:18:27.639,2:18:32.439
gonna get eight so that that'll help him

2:18:29.849,2:18:35.709
release will he see himself top of the

2:18:32.439,2:18:39.399
leaderboards yes time being he will

2:18:35.709,2:18:41.219
first to go over the 200 mark 208 to be

2:18:39.399,2:18:45.429
a precise nine clear of Lee and

2:18:41.219,2:18:48.299
seventeen ahead of bedgood the main

2:18:45.429,2:18:49.660
movers and shakers are about to perform

2:18:48.299,2:18:53.830
[Music]

2:18:49.660,2:18:57.309
at the halfway stage approaching future

2:18:53.830,2:19:00.160
of Canadian male 10 meter diving has

2:18:57.309,2:19:02.830
arrived in Edinburgh let's see whether

2:19:00.160,2:19:05.170
he accepts that tag gratefully and

2:19:02.830,2:19:07.590
gladly on this reverse three and a half

2:19:05.170,2:19:13.389
somersaults we're tuck three point four

2:19:07.590,2:19:15.790
attached to this nice taking it on yep

2:19:13.389,2:19:21.610
the Canadians both of them go fits in

2:19:15.790,2:19:24.309
and makes him to follow shortly Wow good

2:19:21.610,2:19:26.200
dives this one in particular three point

2:19:24.309,2:19:30.340
four it's tricky get it all the way

2:19:26.200,2:19:34.030
round anything above 70 points is good

2:19:30.340,2:19:36.580
75 points even better then up into the

2:19:34.030,2:19:38.920
higher echelon as we go I would not be

2:19:36.580,2:19:40.929
at all surprised of this young man isn't

2:19:38.920,2:19:42.610
on the podium later on today started

2:19:40.929,2:19:44.920
with great confidence so the great smart

2:19:42.610,2:19:46.450
rally with a great attitude it might

2:19:44.920,2:19:51.460
well be a battle between the Canadians

2:19:46.450,2:19:53.229
for medals here or is it good not very

2:19:51.460,2:19:55.660
Matt Mitchum's night and that's two of

2:19:53.229,2:20:00.250
them good to sneak on to the medal

2:19:55.660,2:20:02.890
podium seam Bouchard it's not too far

2:20:00.250,2:20:05.560
shy of a top three place in fact where

2:20:02.890,2:20:09.700
everybody else faltering so able to step

2:20:05.560,2:20:12.040
up on that 3.4 say we have some big

2:20:09.700,2:20:15.040
tariff dives together if it gets more

2:20:12.040,2:20:17.470
immense as the competition goes on this

2:20:15.040,2:20:19.060
is mid-range really not for Bouchard

2:20:17.470,2:20:21.820
though reversed three and a half

2:20:19.060,2:20:25.229
somersaults with tuck for the second

2:20:21.820,2:20:25.229
while the Canadians

2:20:38.130,2:20:42.239
guys an unusual technique he's balanced

2:20:40.409,2:20:44.159
he got his tiptoes and he's standing

2:20:42.239,2:20:46.859
forwards that's highly unusual II took

2:20:44.159,2:20:48.659
ages to go as well it's exactly the same

2:20:46.859,2:20:51.449
dive as his teammate Vinson has just

2:20:48.659,2:20:54.180
performed it it's not as good so that

2:20:51.449,2:20:56.760
means that max will drop a little bit

2:20:54.180,2:21:00.149
further away from where he was on the

2:20:56.760,2:21:01.500
previous rounds he only needed seven and

2:21:00.149,2:21:05.960
a half stakes but that's only gonna get

2:21:01.500,2:21:08.520
5.5 24 points behind his teammate now

2:21:05.960,2:21:13.470
the three rounds to go that can be made

2:21:08.520,2:21:16.770
up Lando is setting the pace and once

2:21:13.470,2:21:19.439
the well looked like being lesser

2:21:16.770,2:21:21.810
medalist now round three Smalling was a

2:21:19.439,2:21:24.119
very good dive for Matt Mitcham on his

2:21:21.810,2:21:28.529
reverser II and a half that's his best

2:21:24.119,2:21:32.630
dive of the competition 88.4 he got that

2:21:28.529,2:21:32.630
he's down on his first two dives tonight

2:21:35.230,2:21:40.300
it's a good time for Mitchum he manages

2:21:38.021,2:21:42.760
to keep the splash time it is the RIP

2:21:40.300,2:21:45.670
entry that we're looking for he does

2:21:42.760,2:21:49.900
wash over vertical so he's only gonna

2:21:45.670,2:21:52.240
get well 18 hearts maybe you needed to

2:21:49.900,2:21:54.040
be completely bolt upright to get 9 in

2:21:52.240,2:21:56.500
Hoss and tens which is pretty much what

2:21:54.040,2:21:59.440
he would need to put pressure on Tom's

2:21:56.500,2:22:03.700
daily this is a big big dive Oh 85

2:21:59.440,2:22:06.340
points plus well he got 450 total this

2:22:03.700,2:22:08.530
morning it's a fatal jig of the joy and

2:22:06.340,2:22:10.210
delight for Matt Mitcham well because

2:22:08.530,2:22:11.830
come close to emulated what he did this

2:22:10.210,2:22:14.800
morning still hasn't quite done it

2:22:11.830,2:22:18.040
they've two attempts of tariffs the

2:22:14.800,2:22:22.030
weakest dive for Tom Daley doesn't

2:22:18.040,2:22:24.340
always translate into our execution it

2:22:22.030,2:22:26.230
will be though any moment now an inward

2:22:24.340,2:22:29.320
three and a half somersaults with tuck

2:22:26.230,2:22:32.260
for daily take off his electric he's

2:22:29.320,2:22:36.220
been working so hard on this boom on the

2:22:32.260,2:22:37.990
start really good strong start rolling

2:22:36.220,2:22:40.000
over as he goes into the water he's

2:22:37.990,2:22:42.880
going to get eight and a half probably

2:22:40.000,2:22:48.311
not good enough for a night good enough

2:22:42.880,2:22:51.250
though he'll be over 80 points six and

2:22:48.311,2:22:54.610
he knows in his head how that compares

2:22:51.250,2:22:57.130
with this morning not that favorably any

2:22:54.610,2:22:59.710
one point six believe three points this

2:22:57.130,2:23:01.420
morning so first time on is evening

2:22:59.710,2:23:04.330
performance he's down on March birds

2:23:01.420,2:23:07.030
only marginal Tom Daly Vincent the we

2:23:04.330,2:23:10.300
end up Mitchum was woken up and come to

2:23:07.030,2:23:13.061
the party now in third place I would say

2:23:10.300,2:23:15.641
Liang in fourth and the two other

2:23:13.061,2:23:18.741
Englishmen in the field James Denny in

2:23:15.641,2:23:21.571
eighth and Matt Dixon in tenth

2:23:18.741,2:23:26.221
so we've reached halfway it's looking

2:23:21.571,2:23:28.801
good for Tom Daley worth 26 point gap

2:23:26.221,2:23:30.841
between him and the rest right now but

2:23:28.801,2:23:33.811
we are only halfway as I mentioned the

2:23:30.841,2:23:37.321
big dives for the likes of Siddappa

2:23:33.811,2:23:41.161
deshi but the main divers still to come

2:23:37.321,2:23:43.650
okay between eight seconds last time

2:23:41.161,2:23:47.041
it's enough possession how long will you

2:23:43.650,2:23:51.301
take over this one reverse two and a

2:23:47.041,2:23:54.081
half somersaults with pike still not

2:23:51.301,2:23:54.081
quite ready to go

2:24:02.431,2:24:07.190
so what your TV hasn't frozen it's

2:24:04.561,2:24:07.190
actually happening

2:24:10.621,2:24:17.681
well next to me in the radio section

2:24:15.311,2:24:19.931
Karen Pickering is summed up perfectly

2:24:17.681,2:24:22.601
she shifted back in a chair and held

2:24:19.931,2:24:25.541
herself because it doesn't take or hit

2:24:22.601,2:24:27.131
in the water but over 35 miles now and

2:24:25.541,2:24:29.261
when you don't get anywhere near up by

2:24:27.131,2:24:30.641
that B does hurt you can tell why sit

2:24:29.261,2:24:31.421
Upton was taking his time and having to

2:24:30.641,2:24:33.431
think about it

2:24:31.421,2:24:36.131
it's a tricky die for verse 2 and 1/2 in

2:24:33.431,2:24:39.311
the pike position and he's just had the

2:24:36.131,2:24:41.171
rough of the water this man made a steel

2:24:39.311,2:24:43.690
or while he was doing something similar

2:24:41.171,2:24:46.871
in the build-up and the training before

2:24:43.690,2:24:48.641
the event itself and just took the

2:24:46.871,2:24:51.251
knocks got back on that 10 meter board

2:24:48.641,2:24:57.131
did it all over again but his brain went

2:24:51.251,2:25:03.190
from the practice I'm afraid Matt Dixon

2:24:57.131,2:25:07.150
is not to put off by that 3.24 of the

2:25:03.190,2:25:09.041
young step his senior debut at the core

2:25:07.150,2:25:13.091
of games in with three and a half

2:25:09.041,2:25:14.681
somersaults 3.2 he's probably safe from

2:25:13.091,2:25:18.030
finishing bottom let's see if you can

2:25:14.681,2:25:18.030
make a few strides up with this

2:25:27.970,2:25:34.790
- the 14-yard from Plymouth

2:25:31.250,2:25:38.600
he's absolutely smashed it

2:25:34.790,2:25:42.020
Wow that is what he's capable

2:25:38.600,2:25:46.520
Oh they've got a big scores coming his

2:25:42.020,2:25:53.090
way I am liking that good work Matty

2:25:46.520,2:25:58.069
Dixon well physically he might look out

2:25:53.090,2:26:03.500
of place here for those marks on 8.5 8.5

2:25:58.069,2:26:05.290
April for 81.6 my oh my I just say he's

2:26:03.500,2:26:07.670
over the fish bottom he may well be a

2:26:05.290,2:26:09.609
couple of places above that the

2:26:07.670,2:26:12.079
performances of that kind that is

2:26:09.609,2:26:14.779
sensational from the oh man and just

2:26:12.079,2:26:17.149
shows the promise he has done employers

2:26:14.779,2:26:19.909
and Ebanks working so hard with him and

2:26:17.149,2:26:21.800
the others great little program and he

2:26:19.909,2:26:24.159
of course worked for 12 years with the

2:26:21.800,2:26:30.140
Tom Daley before he moved to London

2:26:24.159,2:26:32.359
that's what special coaches do chew you

2:26:30.140,2:26:36.260
eat in with three and a half somersaults

2:26:32.359,2:26:38.840
were tuck 3.24 the Malaysian wrong into

2:26:36.260,2:26:41.420
the field in night at the moment boys

2:26:38.840,2:26:43.699
better come to you eat yeah he's third

2:26:41.420,2:26:46.220
right time to back trade half but he

2:26:43.699,2:26:48.409
went surfing cost him his spot on the

2:26:46.220,2:26:52.300
leaderboard this is better not as good

2:26:48.409,2:26:52.300
as Matty Dixon but not far off

2:26:52.311,2:26:57.050
strong takeoff choosing to use a towel

2:26:54.141,2:26:59.181
as a comfort thing to non-slip surface

2:26:57.050,2:27:01.160
on the platform and sometimes prefer the

2:26:59.181,2:27:02.360
grip of a towel which is the blue towel

2:27:01.160,2:27:05.170
that you saw on the 10 meter they're

2:27:02.360,2:27:08.750
just as gue was performing his dive

2:27:05.170,2:27:10.490
seventy six point eight zero doesn't

2:27:08.750,2:27:12.710
look to me like he's doing pushing for a

2:27:10.490,2:27:14.960
medal stay with big tariff times which

2:27:12.710,2:27:18.050
can easily be dropped or failed on

2:27:14.960,2:27:19.761
occasion can't always made a prediction

2:27:18.050,2:27:20.570
even at this stage but there were two

2:27:19.761,2:27:22.130
rounds to go

2:27:20.570,2:27:26.150
looks like he's not gonna be in the

2:27:22.130,2:27:29.330
shake up this man still could be getting

2:27:26.150,2:27:32.450
a bit too in and out great start in both

2:27:29.330,2:27:35.690
the prelims and the final for Dominic

2:27:32.450,2:27:37.820
that's good three point for reverse

2:27:35.690,2:27:41.931
three and a half sixty will put him

2:27:37.820,2:27:45.221
above qu you'ii be looking though for a

2:27:41.931,2:27:45.221
tease if he can

2:27:47.450,2:27:53.680
I sped up from bed goods better for bed

2:27:51.439,2:27:53.680
good

2:27:53.960,2:27:58.640
this went awry in the prelims you almost

2:27:57.140,2:28:00.790
gets it right here in the final just

2:27:58.640,2:28:03.020
needs to look back a little bit more

2:28:00.790,2:28:05.780
marginally short vertical as it goes in

2:28:03.020,2:28:12.979
it's still a good dive way over 70

2:28:05.780,2:28:14.810
points where will that put him seventy

2:28:12.979,2:28:17.030
six point five is what he gets in terms

2:28:14.810,2:28:19.250
of total marks and for the time being

2:28:17.030,2:28:22.160
lead keeps changing hands and it always

2:28:19.250,2:28:25.430
says at this stage as I was just get

2:28:22.160,2:28:27.770
their noses in front of the opposition

2:28:25.430,2:28:33.170
but we're not down to the sharp ends by

2:28:27.770,2:28:36.320
any means yet seven divers to go and if

2:28:33.170,2:28:38.690
Lee James Denny will be performing that

2:28:36.320,2:28:41.740
dive reverse three and a half

2:28:38.690,2:28:45.620
somersaults we're tucked three point for

2:28:41.740,2:28:47.780
the looking to go crashing through the

2:28:45.620,2:28:52.850
200 barrier here currently in fifth

2:28:47.780,2:28:57.680
place so again not too far shy of a top

2:28:52.850,2:28:59.240
three place yes he is it just goes to

2:28:57.680,2:29:01.580
show how difficult these dives are this

2:28:59.240,2:29:03.350
one in particular the reverse three and

2:29:01.580,2:29:06.190
a half you've got to jump away from the

2:29:03.350,2:29:08.720
diving board spin backwards towards it

2:29:06.190,2:29:10.729
which is exactly what he does he's just

2:29:08.720,2:29:11.780
squeezed his shape and there comes out

2:29:10.729,2:29:16.840
if he's diving a little bit too early

2:29:11.780,2:29:16.840
lands flat on his back what a shame

2:29:17.260,2:29:23.140
yeah it looks like his chance of a medal

2:29:21.440,2:29:27.080
which look very good before that dive

2:29:23.140,2:29:28.100
have just evaporated the Royal can walk

2:29:27.080,2:29:31.909
all in Emperor

2:29:28.100,2:29:35.180
former Chinese diver retired came back

2:29:31.909,2:29:36.949
coaching in Wellington Nicky is still

2:29:35.180,2:29:38.960
coaching as well as well as performing

2:29:36.949,2:29:42.250
but my person who decided retirement was

2:29:38.960,2:29:46.279
not for him consideration retirement for

2:29:42.250,2:29:49.279
this man 20 years of age course 12 days

2:29:46.279,2:29:50.569
been around a long time so both about

2:29:49.279,2:29:55.040
the same age we haven't seen anywhere

2:29:50.569,2:29:56.810
near as much of James Danny the syncro

2:29:55.040,2:29:58.939
were Tom Daly last night here he is on

2:29:56.810,2:30:00.890
the individual with the reverse three

2:29:58.939,2:30:03.649
and a half the tuck you saw how it went

2:30:00.890,2:30:06.199
last time let's see how it goes this

2:30:03.649,2:30:13.040
time can he improve and we've just seen

2:30:06.199,2:30:16.040
from the fengyang oh yes he can

2:30:13.040,2:30:17.420
that's much better James jumps quite far

2:30:16.040,2:30:19.750
from the diving port of a shinobi

2:30:17.420,2:30:22.119
working hard with a deep up in Leeds

2:30:19.750,2:30:24.020
high-performance diving Center on this

2:30:22.119,2:30:25.939
doesn't really need to be that far away

2:30:24.020,2:30:28.399
from the diving board makes it tricky to

2:30:25.939,2:30:30.649
control but he does a good job on that

2:30:28.399,2:30:32.510
so just throwing up too much splash as

2:30:30.649,2:30:33.920
he goes in that's much better than this

2:30:32.510,2:30:36.949
morning a better than the synchro

2:30:33.920,2:30:37.909
competition last night progress and

2:30:36.949,2:30:40.279
that's what they're looking for

2:30:37.909,2:30:41.750
still not quite where it's totally

2:30:40.279,2:30:45.109
likely to be on deep where he wants it

2:30:41.750,2:30:48.260
to be but six point five and seven means

2:30:45.109,2:30:53.170
he's above a few doing fengyang leaned

2:30:48.260,2:30:59.000
out and three points clear of Matt Dixon

2:30:53.170,2:31:00.500
it's a liang sometime is faltering at

2:30:59.000,2:31:04.040
the moment they're not quite getting

2:31:00.500,2:31:08.029
there top scorers he's in range on a

2:31:04.040,2:31:10.609
medal already got the three meter let's

2:31:08.029,2:31:15.560
just go through the card one meter three

2:31:10.609,2:31:17.529
meter and 2 meter and here's his back

2:31:15.560,2:31:20.060
three and a half

2:31:17.529,2:31:25.640
send him towards 300 points if he gets

2:31:20.060,2:31:26.780
it right oh I thought he was out way too

2:31:25.640,2:31:29.270
early on

2:31:26.780,2:31:32.330
but he knows exactly where he is good

2:31:29.270,2:31:33.590
every unawareness do you know where you

2:31:32.330,2:31:35.120
are when he's spinning around and

2:31:33.590,2:31:37.130
falling down towards the Earth at

2:31:35.120,2:31:40.820
breakneck speeds blow yes is the answer

2:31:37.130,2:31:42.440
from Bootsy Liang that's good he was a

2:31:40.820,2:31:45.320
little bit early but Manisha Stern's

2:31:42.440,2:31:46.850
bullet mines yeah looking back up to the

2:31:45.320,2:31:48.080
hole he just created it he can punch

2:31:46.850,2:31:50.240
through the walls with his hands in a

2:31:48.080,2:31:52.250
graph position getting feedback from his

2:31:50.240,2:31:54.440
coach himself an exceptional diver in

2:31:52.250,2:31:57.110
his day used to dive against me he's a

2:31:54.440,2:32:02.150
bit slimmer than though not as handsome

2:31:57.110,2:32:05.740
obviously I'll do Vincent DeLorean doll

2:32:02.150,2:32:05.740
I've never known you speechless before

2:32:06.040,2:32:14.360
3.2 degree of difficulty now this young

2:32:11.420,2:32:18.080
Canadian 17 years of age back at what

2:32:14.360,2:32:20.600
he's done so far diving in the Canadian

2:32:18.080,2:32:23.980
program for what now 12 years very

2:32:20.600,2:32:26.660
experienced but not at this level yet oh

2:32:23.980,2:32:28.580
it's a good dog just a little bit of

2:32:26.660,2:32:31.160
smash couldn't quite keep keep the

2:32:28.580,2:32:32.600
splash down it started a rip entry where

2:32:31.160,2:32:34.760
you punch a hole in the water by

2:32:32.600,2:32:37.180
grabbing the hands it look to show he's

2:32:34.760,2:32:37.180
going to disappear

2:32:37.330,2:32:41.561
just as you see here Liberty smash being

2:32:39.280,2:32:43.390
thrown up it's a good dive it'll get

2:32:41.561,2:32:47.410
eight and that certainly keeps his

2:32:43.390,2:32:49.840
campaign for a metal alive keep saying

2:32:47.410,2:32:52.390
it oh I'm not going to put the mockers

2:32:49.840,2:32:54.010
on him and Lux his consistency

2:32:52.390,2:32:56.380
I like his attitude you know like the

2:32:54.010,2:32:58.840
way it's performing tonight excellent

2:32:56.380,2:33:03.250
dive eights across the board takes him

2:32:58.840,2:33:05.021
above boots a liang chances are he'll be

2:33:03.250,2:33:06.400
in medal position at the end of this

2:33:05.021,2:33:08.260
round if that's he definitely well

2:33:06.400,2:33:13.540
because Maxine Bouchard could not

2:33:08.260,2:33:15.820
overtake him at this stage best he can

2:33:13.540,2:33:17.410
do is second place and to do that it's

2:33:15.820,2:33:18.850
basically to get tense and we've not

2:33:17.410,2:33:20.170
seen too many of those well there mr.

2:33:18.850,2:33:23.430
Daly might have something to say about

2:33:20.170,2:33:23.430
that when he steps up shortly

2:33:29.510,2:33:33.630
yeah it's good he kept all the splash

2:33:31.770,2:33:36.690
down little bit soft in his lower back

2:33:33.630,2:33:39.990
as it goes into the water so max looking

2:33:36.690,2:33:43.160
to pick up on a slightly faltering dive

2:33:39.990,2:33:47.700
in the previous round and that will help

2:33:43.160,2:33:50.670
they'll only be in the early 70s so 72

2:33:47.700,2:33:51.590
73 with that one if you get 7 point 5 s

2:33:50.670,2:33:54.930
& 8

2:33:51.590,2:33:58.820
pick up me calculations to sixty four

2:33:54.930,2:34:01.250
point four seven point five and eight

2:33:58.820,2:34:03.580
look out towards his total

2:34:01.250,2:34:07.530
[Music]

2:34:03.580,2:34:08.680
around 4:00 this morning Matt Mitcham 60

2:34:07.530,2:34:11.170
7.20

2:34:08.680,2:34:15.880
which actually was his second lowest

2:34:11.170,2:34:17.920
score his lowest coming on round 5 this

2:34:15.880,2:34:19.510
is where it starts swing one stage Tom

2:34:17.920,2:34:21.340
Daly was last in the prelims this

2:34:19.510,2:34:22.240
morning Mitchum was leading the way for

2:34:21.340,2:34:24.250
quite a while

2:34:22.240,2:34:27.450
inward three and a half somersaults with

2:34:24.250,2:34:33.939
tuck three point two for the 2008

2:34:27.450,2:34:36.790
Olympic champion he is not having a very

2:34:33.939,2:34:39.370
good meet at all mitchum it's not on

2:34:36.790,2:34:42.250
fire in fact he's not even smoldering

2:34:39.370,2:34:43.210
this is very very weak from the 2008

2:34:42.250,2:34:45.910
olympic champion

2:34:43.210,2:34:49.689
he's been smashing it in trading and he

2:34:45.910,2:34:52.630
just isn't he has to find his groove Wow

2:34:49.689,2:34:54.310
so he's going to be battling for you

2:34:52.630,2:34:56.550
know to hold on to his potential silver

2:34:54.310,2:34:59.500
here you can see nobody's smiling happy

2:34:56.550,2:35:01.870
yeah that's for the force wave and a

2:34:59.500,2:35:03.970
smile isn't it well he's happy it's a

2:35:01.870,2:35:05.800
jazz hands but look at the jazz hands

2:35:03.970,2:35:08.229
there because that's emulating what he

2:35:05.800,2:35:12.450
did this morning and that chasm between

2:35:08.229,2:35:15.040
him and Tom Daly opens up thoughts but

2:35:12.450,2:35:16.780
this we're talking about the big one

2:35:15.040,2:35:19.990
being his second round I once his bogey

2:35:16.780,2:35:22.899
dive which he did okay on but this this

2:35:19.990,2:35:26.080
morning he set into the stratosphere 101

2:35:22.899,2:35:27.939
point seven five twice he went over a

2:35:26.080,2:35:30.160
hundred this morning and consecutive

2:35:27.939,2:35:31.660
dives this was the first of them you

2:35:30.160,2:35:33.660
wait for the roof to come off here so

2:35:31.660,2:35:36.220
listed building so hopefully it doesn't

2:35:33.660,2:35:40.510
forward four and a half some sorts with

2:35:36.220,2:35:42.460
tuck go tom ice not as good as this

2:35:40.510,2:35:44.560
morning but is plenty good enough for

2:35:42.460,2:35:47.590
him to stay in the lead three point

2:35:44.560,2:35:49.660
seven degree of difficulty forward four

2:35:47.590,2:35:50.470
and a half somersaults in the tough

2:35:49.660,2:35:53.260
position

2:35:50.470,2:35:55.300
Tom way T Pike side he's got a great

2:35:53.260,2:35:57.310
takeoff on that as we saw this morning

2:35:55.300,2:35:59.740
he sailed over 100 points this will be

2:35:57.310,2:36:01.420
close to 80 maybe just over 80 points

2:35:59.740,2:36:03.430
but you know what there is a really

2:36:01.420,2:36:04.479
competition going on the moment tom is

2:36:03.430,2:36:06.859
way out in front

2:36:04.479,2:36:09.590
Mitch I'm not really featuring and

2:36:06.859,2:36:12.680
that's in the top three is he he's art

2:36:09.590,2:36:15.770
and Tom Daly been like Jack law and the

2:36:12.680,2:36:17.779
prelims of three meter is miles and of

2:36:15.770,2:36:19.819
everybody else and this is the final

2:36:17.779,2:36:22.669
when it counts three twenty point four

2:36:19.819,2:36:24.529
five look at that nearly thirty mark

2:36:22.669,2:36:27.680
separating here man Vincent Dorian dole

2:36:24.529,2:36:30.140
would say Liang Matt Mitcham just

2:36:27.680,2:36:31.039
holding onto the coattails of the medals

2:36:30.140,2:36:34.039
not in there yet

2:36:31.039,2:36:38.050
James Denny innate antics midnight and

2:36:34.039,2:36:42.739
sit up but there xi and xi for india

2:36:38.050,2:36:43.600
looking good for Tom Daley keep very

2:36:42.739,2:36:46.609
good indeed

2:36:43.600,2:36:51.379
went to anoint him yet with that gold

2:36:46.609,2:36:53.060
medal this is too big died for Matthew

2:36:51.379,2:36:56.239
Mitchum including his last one when she

2:36:53.060,2:36:57.729
got eighty six on the boys he got some

2:36:56.239,2:37:04.069
ground to make up

2:36:57.729,2:37:06.819
our deshi forward to an hour somersaults

2:37:04.069,2:37:06.819
one twist

2:37:07.530,2:37:14.340
that is the best dive we've seen from

2:37:10.440,2:37:16.340
pardeshi certainly on this guy sometimes

2:37:14.340,2:37:19.110
has a bit of trouble with his twist

2:37:16.340,2:37:20.880
wobbles around for this one he manages

2:37:19.110,2:37:22.560
his feet are quite pointed are they

2:37:20.880,2:37:25.500
they've got one pointed at one half

2:37:22.560,2:37:28.760
pointed crossed over a little bit so

2:37:25.500,2:37:31.770
he's a little bit rough around the edges

2:37:28.760,2:37:34.830
knees straight up and down

2:37:31.770,2:37:36.360
he's hold his triceps a saying that he

2:37:34.830,2:37:37.890
said a bit of pain I'm not in the least

2:37:36.360,2:37:39.270
bit surprised having seen what he put

2:37:37.890,2:37:40.530
himself through today not to talk about

2:37:39.270,2:37:42.470
the competition this morning and tonight

2:37:40.530,2:37:44.670
will release done in between times

2:37:42.470,2:37:46.560
basically kept getting back on that 10

2:37:44.670,2:37:49.260
meter board and doing it and he got it

2:37:46.560,2:37:52.110
right it's not very surprising his body

2:37:49.260,2:37:54.530
is time to break down a little bit it

2:37:52.110,2:37:58.380
could be earlier in the week as well

2:37:54.530,2:38:00.570
it's round I've Matt Dixon is acquitting

2:37:58.380,2:38:04.110
himself very very well indeed the 14

2:38:00.570,2:38:04.710
year old from Plymouth British champion

2:38:04.110,2:38:09.030
this year

2:38:04.710,2:38:10.920

2:38:09.030,2:38:14.630
school either back three and a half

2:38:10.920,2:38:18.410
somersaults with tuck three point three

2:38:14.630,2:38:18.410
or the Devonian

2:38:20.660,2:38:26.890
oh nice just a little over rotation too

2:38:24.800,2:38:29.630
big died for him three point three

2:38:26.890,2:38:32.420
starting backwards swinging the arms

2:38:29.630,2:38:34.850
above the head looking at where you've

2:38:32.420,2:38:36.710
been not where you're going kicking his

2:38:34.850,2:38:38.570
feet up towards the 10-meter just a

2:38:36.710,2:38:41.090
little bit too high throwing a bit of

2:38:38.570,2:38:42.620
splasher that's still that's probably

2:38:41.090,2:38:44.360
better than he did this morning let me

2:38:42.620,2:38:46.100
just check yes he only got fives on this

2:38:44.360,2:38:49.939
this morning that'll be six point five s

2:38:46.100,2:38:52.939
good work buddy do good work in deme a

2:38:49.939,2:38:55.189
TD oh you're simon against the Gold

2:38:52.939,2:38:56.960
Coast in the filled out a bit you look

2:38:55.189,2:38:59.810
grown a bit they look a completely

2:38:56.960,2:39:01.820
different competitor but fantastic spear

2:38:59.810,2:39:04.460
has so many in Delhi who come back and

2:39:01.820,2:39:09.610
improved on their performances for years

2:39:04.460,2:39:13.399
on qu e seventh place well I've got say

2:39:09.610,2:39:16.300
three four five and six are very tightly

2:39:13.399,2:39:19.040
bunched so needs to jump out of the pack

2:39:16.300,2:39:22.430
it's not too far back with two rounds to

2:39:19.040,2:39:25.450
go it's three point four reversed three

2:39:22.430,2:39:28.450
and a half somersaults we tuck for

2:39:25.450,2:39:28.450
Hughie

2:39:35.460,2:39:40.949
oh you're my goodness oh now that is

2:39:39.330,2:39:42.851
like being smacked around the back of

2:39:40.949,2:39:46.391
the head

2:39:42.851,2:39:48.610
by a baseball bat ouch

2:39:46.391,2:39:50.440
so it's all okay until now he doesn't

2:39:48.610,2:39:53.021
quite get its hands back at all just

2:39:50.440,2:39:54.880
collapse into the water that water can

2:39:53.021,2:39:56.860
feel like your arms are being ripped out

2:39:54.880,2:39:58.660
from the sockets in fact I had for

2:39:56.860,2:40:01.030
reconstructive shoulder surgeries in my

2:39:58.660,2:40:02.860
career diving from the 10-meter I hope

2:40:01.030,2:40:03.340
you eat doesn't need to book himself in

2:40:02.860,2:40:05.500
for one

2:40:03.340,2:40:07.181
well his body folded up like one of your

2:40:05.500,2:40:07.980
deck chairs there as he went into the

2:40:07.181,2:40:10.570
water

2:40:07.980,2:40:11.830
Nicky kind of for half his body meant

2:40:10.570,2:40:14.860
the other half of his body going in

2:40:11.830,2:40:17.500
there I think as few people are just

2:40:14.860,2:40:18.580
recoiled it's like watching Doctor Who

2:40:17.500,2:40:23.290
when you're a young kid you're behind

2:40:18.580,2:40:26.110
the sofa after that here donate bed good

2:40:23.290,2:40:28.150
of Australia now who wants to get into

2:40:26.110,2:40:30.210
these medal positions we're not assuming

2:40:28.150,2:40:33.160
tom days well it just yet but we are

2:40:30.210,2:40:36.670
looking at those who might push for

2:40:33.160,2:40:38.681
silver and bronze he's fifth and this is

2:40:36.670,2:40:41.620
the big one you saw Daly do pretty well

2:40:38.681,2:40:46.120
on recently honey three men are doing it

2:40:41.620,2:40:49.090
Ford four and a half oh that's good for

2:40:46.120,2:40:52.101
bed goods that's okay little bit of

2:40:49.090,2:40:54.290
splash being thrown up

2:40:52.101,2:40:56.900
so needs to squeeze interest up shape a

2:40:54.290,2:40:59.061
little bit Boise loosen it but he's a

2:40:56.900,2:40:59.540
little scrappy but he gets it on his

2:40:59.061,2:41:02.570
head

2:40:59.540,2:41:06.021
it is 3.7 so it's worth a lot because

2:41:02.570,2:41:07.580
mathematically the scores multiplied by

2:41:06.021,2:41:11.271
the degree of difficulty

2:41:07.580,2:41:15.290
okay 68 well then for that splash if we

2:41:11.271,2:41:16.580
look at the 80s but 68.4 well sure I bet

2:41:15.290,2:41:19.011
you think your home that looks really

2:41:16.580,2:41:21.410
good but that's why she kind of gives it

2:41:19.011,2:41:27.650
away a little bit but you guys go into

2:41:21.410,2:41:30.320
the lead with Lee Danny same yang Rando

2:41:27.650,2:41:32.601
Bouchard Mitchum and of course our

2:41:30.320,2:41:36.440
runaway leader at the moment Tom Daly to

2:41:32.601,2:41:37.190
come back to the arm stance I don't see

2:41:36.440,2:41:39.980
one of these for a while

2:41:37.190,2:41:43.250
I'm stand back a double somersault one

2:41:39.980,2:41:46.070
and a half twists he's off he's off but

2:41:43.250,2:41:48.471
he's in and he disappears he everything

2:41:46.070,2:41:51.290
he needs in the dive good strong take

2:41:48.471,2:41:53.721
off one and a half twist double

2:41:51.290,2:41:55.900
somersault and a good entry into the

2:41:53.721,2:41:55.900
water

2:41:57.040,2:42:01.221
no I wasn't quite ready for that

2:41:59.690,2:42:06.351
commentary but I got it out in the end

2:42:01.221,2:42:07.101
hopefully it made sense why James have

2:42:06.351,2:42:12.141
over lifetime

2:42:07.101,2:42:13.340
sevens 67 for Li fen yang yeah I don't

2:42:12.141,2:42:16.000
think we're gonna see him on the medal

2:42:13.340,2:42:19.311
podium later on

2:42:16.000,2:42:23.320
sevens was okay to be honest when it

2:42:19.311,2:42:27.590
seemed totally under control with that

2:42:23.320,2:42:30.170
not holding back the senior English

2:42:27.590,2:42:32.061
divers here a year three point three non

2:42:30.170,2:42:33.920
serves only a three point zero zero to

2:42:32.061,2:42:34.641
three point six or Saroyan the next and

2:42:33.920,2:42:36.891
see what happens

2:42:34.641,2:42:39.130
James Denny has done just that and the

2:42:36.891,2:42:41.360
courses this was spot on

2:42:39.130,2:42:43.280
eighth place can be translated into

2:42:41.360,2:42:45.351
something much much better back two and

2:42:43.280,2:42:45.830
a half two and a half twists you've seen

2:42:45.351,2:42:48.980
this before

2:42:45.830,2:42:52.480
it's a Tom Daley's earlier dive that

2:42:48.980,2:42:52.480
that she was okay today

2:42:57.751,2:43:03.301
oh it's good font any three point six

2:43:01.171,2:43:05.881
two and a half somersault two and a half

2:43:03.301,2:43:08.101
twist in the pike position great stroke

2:43:05.881,2:43:10.891
takeoff good leg extension helicopter

2:43:08.101,2:43:13.021
feet so the judges all cane him for that

2:43:10.891,2:43:14.551
this could have got eights maybe even an

2:43:13.021,2:43:16.261
eight point five pretty gotta keep your

2:43:14.551,2:43:18.900
legs together your toes pointed you

2:43:16.261,2:43:21.150
can't be flipping your feet around like

2:43:18.900,2:43:24.780
they're helicopter rotors ooh

2:43:21.150,2:43:30.811
Denny Ruby do seven point five and a

2:43:24.780,2:43:34.711
seven for the Englishman from reads 20

2:43:30.811,2:43:39.061
years of age same age as Tom Daley but

2:43:34.711,2:43:43.831
he said it's a second of the most tips

2:43:39.061,2:43:47.641
and leigh below him that was still not

2:43:43.831,2:43:50.851
quite he can be that same yang is kind

2:43:47.641,2:43:52.831
of profiting from other people around

2:43:50.851,2:43:54.921
him not doing what they should do so

2:43:52.831,2:43:58.230
that's why he finds himself in third but

2:43:54.921,2:43:59.610
so canadians gonna have something to say

2:43:58.230,2:44:02.301
about that and Matt Mitcham forty

2:43:59.610,2:44:06.121
eventually to reverse three and a half

2:44:02.301,2:44:09.100
or just just just manages to hang on to

2:44:06.121,2:44:10.689
that we watching min training

2:44:09.100,2:44:12.819
and he's been a little bit here and

2:44:10.689,2:44:15.399
there that is short short of vertical

2:44:12.819,2:44:16.810
but it's tight it's good form and so

2:44:15.399,2:44:18.010
he's probably gonna sneak sevens from

2:44:16.810,2:44:21.010
the judges that'll keep him in

2:44:18.010,2:44:25.209
contention for a medal Bootsy Liang one

2:44:21.010,2:44:28.270
dies to go it's on together calculators

2:44:25.209,2:44:30.180
out it's gonna get very tight because

2:44:28.270,2:44:32.409
those chasing Daly

2:44:30.180,2:44:35.169
grouped together very close here though

2:44:32.409,2:44:38.199
as a 19 point advantage for who'd say

2:44:35.169,2:44:46.359
Liang over bed good 7s cross the board

2:44:38.199,2:44:48.819
71 point for bin sent way and all so he

2:44:46.359,2:44:52.180
pointed out to me that does that mean no

2:44:48.819,2:44:54.129
water or worse than that effect in in

2:44:52.180,2:44:59.439
French which doesn't seem quite right

2:44:54.129,2:45:01.089
for a diver is it this is three point

2:44:59.439,2:45:02.970
three no he is second place at the

2:45:01.089,2:45:05.589
moment

2:45:02.970,2:45:09.010
well that's good well what's that gonna

2:45:05.589,2:45:11.229
do is that gonna help or hinder so it's

2:45:09.010,2:45:13.119
okay it's above average it's a big dive

2:45:11.229,2:45:15.069
so I'm gonna see a couple of these in a

2:45:13.119,2:45:16.239
row now this one from Vincent Max is

2:45:15.069,2:45:18.310
gonna follow the dementia was

2:45:16.239,2:45:20.949
diagramming his back for enough Pike to

2:45:18.310,2:45:23.109
a back thrown off targets so this is

2:45:20.949,2:45:27.279
only gonna get sevens which means you'll

2:45:23.109,2:45:30.609
be less than 70 points Willie bunch up

2:45:27.279,2:45:34.310
with oopsie Liang I think you well yes

2:45:30.609,2:45:36.859
precisely what he has done

2:45:34.310,2:45:39.109
two and a half point lead over the

2:45:36.859,2:45:40.909
Malaysian and that is nothing going into

2:45:39.109,2:45:43.760
the last round of Tolerance certainly no

2:45:40.909,2:45:47.600
lead you can protect that see what

2:45:43.760,2:45:53.199
Bouchard might just have fallen away

2:45:47.600,2:45:56.299
from a medal push well you know though

2:45:53.199,2:45:59.060
he gets 90 he goes in behind this

2:45:56.299,2:46:01.279
Canadian colleague on this back three

2:45:59.060,2:46:06.470
and a half somersaults with tuck exactly

2:46:01.279,2:46:08.600
the same dive you've just seen he's done

2:46:06.470,2:46:11.119
well he's just a little bit low on the

2:46:08.600,2:46:12.979
water losing it on the takeoff not quite

2:46:11.119,2:46:14.959
powerful enough not generating enough

2:46:12.979,2:46:16.549
spitting speed so it needs to get his

2:46:14.959,2:46:18.529
arms to and extend a little bit more

2:46:16.549,2:46:20.869
through the legs so as you can see here

2:46:18.529,2:46:23.510
just arching as he gets in it's clean

2:46:20.869,2:46:27.649
and tidy but he will drift now away from

2:46:23.510,2:46:31.189
the medals yeah I think he's got too

2:46:27.649,2:46:34.159
much to make up now he is 25.5 18 yang

2:46:31.189,2:46:37.629
28 points behind his teammate so not

2:46:34.159,2:46:40.189
today for men or for Maxime Bouchard

2:46:37.629,2:46:42.020
continuing with giving you a little

2:46:40.189,2:46:43.399
heads-up on this morning's performance

2:46:42.020,2:46:45.229
compared to tonight this was actually

2:46:43.399,2:46:48.319
Matthew Mitchell's worse time in terms

2:46:45.229,2:46:50.510
of marks worth mention he's changed it

2:46:48.319,2:46:52.129
so he's gone from a two point six degree

2:46:50.510,2:46:53.539
of difficulty about three and half Pike

2:46:52.129,2:46:56.089
to this a back three and a half

2:46:53.539,2:46:58.970
somersaults in the tucked position three

2:46:56.089,2:47:00.169
point three yeah fifty two point two he

2:46:58.970,2:47:04.220
picked up this morning that's what he

2:47:00.169,2:47:05.720
does now yeah it much better but then it

2:47:04.220,2:47:07.669
was this morning obviously it's a

2:47:05.720,2:47:09.799
different died he's playing safe I think

2:47:07.669,2:47:12.079
he's left himself too much to do to

2:47:09.799,2:47:14.629
challenge Tom for the gold but he's

2:47:12.079,2:47:17.810
happy to fight for this silver will that

2:47:14.629,2:47:21.169
be enough to get him closer to the

2:47:17.810,2:47:23.419
Canadian and to the Malaysian it's okay

2:47:21.169,2:47:25.609
but it's not good enough I've seen him

2:47:23.419,2:47:27.709
to go straight tens on this dive he's

2:47:25.609,2:47:29.539
short vertical there he's gonna struggle

2:47:27.709,2:47:31.220
to get a medal that would be a turn up

2:47:29.539,2:47:35.180
for the books wouldn't adjust third at

2:47:31.220,2:47:36.751
the moment where Davy still to come so

2:47:35.180,2:47:40.891
high and OH

2:47:36.751,2:47:46.471
and who'd say Liang likely medalists

2:47:40.891,2:47:49.940
right now the star turn the class act

was Tom Daly well sadly those tens or

2:48:46.800,2:48:52.589
that's ten does not count towards a

2:48:49.260,2:48:55.319
title and the total nine point five nine

2:48:52.589,2:48:56.879
point five and nine point five two so

2:48:55.319,2:49:01.050

2:49:01.050,2:49:05.760
second look outside it is though for the

2:49:03.869,2:49:08.659

2:49:05.760,2:49:13.619
big dive at the end three point six

2:49:08.659,2:49:15.419
Denny in seven matthew dixon in eight so

2:49:13.619,2:49:17.069
you'd noticed Tom Daly walking up the

2:49:15.419,2:49:18.390
steps there followed by his coach Jen

2:49:17.069,2:49:20.310
there's been lots of questions where is

2:49:18.390,2:49:21.989
he going he's actually moving up you're

2:49:20.310,2:49:23.489
moving yourself up to the dry land dive

2:49:21.989,2:49:25.350
the area where he'll prepare for the

2:49:23.489,2:49:27.390
next die there's crash mats out there

2:49:25.350,2:49:31.560
he'll be preparing for each and every

2:49:27.390,2:49:33.329
dive we enjoyed having him here I think

2:49:31.560,2:49:34.800
it's enjoy being here those body may not

2:49:33.329,2:49:37.859
feel quite that way after this

2:49:34.800,2:49:41.669
competition sin alpha deshi leaves his

2:49:37.859,2:49:44.060
arm stands till the very end to point

2:49:41.669,2:49:46.470
seven so it's not a big tariff die but I

2:49:44.060,2:49:49.829
feel the creaking joints as he gets into

2:49:46.470,2:49:50.879
the upright position always off yeah

2:49:49.829,2:49:52.020
these are fee wants to get this

2:49:53.720,2:50:00.289
and he has so that's six dives he has

2:49:57.859,2:50:02.510
hurt himself though I'm quite a few of

2:50:00.289,2:50:04.729
his dives in training but he is made of

2:50:02.510,2:50:07.249
tough stuff that's it he can have a vest

2:50:04.729,2:50:09.020
a beautiful dive to finish extranet into

2:50:07.249,2:50:10.670
the water doesn't really hold his arms

2:50:09.020,2:50:13.369
that long enough so the judges will

2:50:10.670,2:50:14.569
penalize him he got 17 feet out his arm

2:50:13.369,2:50:18.170
stand well done

2:50:14.569,2:50:23.470
Sid asked bonus you 250 8.30 keeps away

2:50:18.170,2:50:26.659
fear thank you to Indian divers here

2:50:23.470,2:50:29.359
he's gonna need pushes all the way back

2:50:26.659,2:50:33.739
on that flames to support his aching

2:50:29.359,2:50:39.189
body huge cheer once again for the

2:50:33.739,2:50:43.159
little man they look very different in

2:50:39.189,2:50:47.380
four years time is Matthew Dickson you

2:50:43.159,2:50:49.699
imagine being 14 being pint-sized and

2:50:47.380,2:50:52.489
doing a forward two and a half

2:50:49.699,2:50:54.920
somersaults with one twist that's a view

2:50:52.489,2:51:01.310
the Matthew Dixon hairs and what he's

2:50:54.920,2:51:03.770
about to do it's really gone for it

2:51:01.310,2:51:05.720
he's naive as he landed on the head to

2:51:03.770,2:51:08.180
the 10-meter board have my headphones

2:51:05.720,2:51:10.399
off me but going he pushed so much

2:51:08.180,2:51:12.560
effort into it pops up into the air just

2:51:10.399,2:51:14.869
a little bit of an overvote ation one

2:51:12.560,2:51:17.510
twist into the two and a half somersault

2:51:14.869,2:51:20.060
just drifting over a vertical water

2:51:17.510,2:51:22.370
performance from this young boy three

2:51:20.060,2:51:23.050
six six

2:51:22.370,2:51:24.369
[Applause]

2:51:23.050,2:51:28.420
[Music]

2:51:24.369,2:51:30.949
yeah we'll see more of him

2:51:28.420,2:51:33.710
European chaps sure he's going at the

2:51:30.949,2:51:36.260
world champs ex year and the Olympics in

2:51:33.710,2:51:37.850
Rio almost certain to be part of the GB

2:51:36.260,2:51:40.039
team lot can change in two years of

2:51:37.850,2:51:41.899
diving though injuries and illness and

2:51:40.039,2:51:45.229
stuff like that but I think they'll see

2:51:41.899,2:51:49.520
him competing in Rio in a couple of

2:51:45.229,2:51:51.500
years time a lot of promise shown by

2:51:49.520,2:51:55.340
this young man as well but hasn't quite

2:51:51.500,2:52:01.069
been realized this evening final round

2:51:55.340,2:52:02.840
for qu e 3.2 in the pike position of

2:52:01.069,2:52:05.479
back two and a half somersaults one and

2:52:02.840,2:52:07.760
a half twists this is how he finishes

2:52:05.479,2:52:10.060
off a very arduous week edges are a lot

2:52:07.760,2:52:10.060
of diving

2:52:15.670,2:52:20.710
yeah it's a tidy finish from gue two and

2:52:19.449,2:52:22.300
a half some sauce with one and a half

2:52:20.710,2:52:25.149
twists only three point two degree of

2:52:22.300,2:52:26.529
difficulty the next diver humbly beg

2:52:25.149,2:52:28.330
good we'll add a twist to this time

2:52:26.529,2:52:30.250
making the even more complex and earning

2:52:28.330,2:52:32.170
an extra point four degree of difficulty

2:52:30.250,2:52:33.819
so this is good fun to you II just

2:52:32.170,2:52:35.620
rolling over he's had a pretty steady

2:52:33.819,2:52:37.359
performance today we'll finish outside

2:52:35.620,2:52:39.699
of the medals but he's dived in out to

2:52:37.359,2:52:45.670
every competition available and he's do

2:52:39.699,2:52:52.500
reversed and now he can 7.57 sixty eight

2:52:45.670,2:52:58.949
point eight I'm just gonna finish below

2:52:52.500,2:53:02.649
Matthew Dixon it's all make bed good

2:52:58.949,2:53:05.020
kind of top and tail in terms of his

2:53:02.649,2:53:08.109
best performances from this morning

2:53:05.020,2:53:09.880
great opening of a bad finish fifth

2:53:08.109,2:53:12.640
place and what's you need to get up

2:53:09.880,2:53:14.409
there and really needs mid 80s high

2:53:12.640,2:53:17.109
eighties preferably on the sixth three

2:53:14.409,2:53:19.359
point six back two and a half two and a

2:53:17.109,2:53:21.870
half twist it gets 90 or so good push

2:53:19.359,2:53:21.870
for a medal

2:53:22.620,2:53:26.710
yeah he's a good twister didn't quite

2:53:24.819,2:53:29.819
finish the dive off its landing very

2:53:26.710,2:53:33.489
similar to Tom but for different reasons

2:53:29.819,2:53:36.580
so tonics takeoff is good twist very

2:53:33.489,2:53:37.960
very quickly just Easter squeezes and

2:53:36.580,2:53:40.120
pike shape a little bit longer to

2:53:37.960,2:53:43.090
straighten out as he goes in it's high

2:53:40.120,2:53:44.939
risk high degree of difficulty didn't

2:53:43.090,2:53:47.560
quite work out for the young Australian

2:53:44.939,2:53:49.270
no there's a good start I could finish

2:53:47.560,2:53:51.300
this morning not a good finish in the

2:53:49.270,2:53:54.340
evening as well he's a bit down on his

2:53:51.300,2:53:57.790
total mark doesn't make 400 this time

2:53:54.340,2:54:02.430
round United seven five five and there

2:53:57.790,2:54:02.430
is metal chances disappeared

2:54:04.020,2:54:14.219
[Music]

2:54:07.819,2:54:19.409
Lee Korean dough Bouchard Mitchum all

2:54:14.219,2:54:25.049
doing this dive in the last round my

2:54:19.409,2:54:27.419
place for we coach from Wellington and

2:54:25.049,2:54:28.829
decided after retiring a few years ago

2:54:27.419,2:54:32.939
he's gonna come back into the sport and

2:54:28.829,2:54:35.669
has done just that god it's a beautiful

2:54:32.939,2:54:39.449
time to finish family he's done a lot of

2:54:35.669,2:54:39.959
diving as well great vertical entry to

2:54:39.449,2:54:41.969
the water

2:54:39.959,2:54:44.969
hardly any splash here's one and a half

2:54:41.969,2:54:46.379
twist two and a half somersaults moving

2:54:44.969,2:54:49.049
away from the diving board a little bit

2:54:46.379,2:54:50.989
I think that's a good entry maybe even

2:54:49.049,2:54:53.249
get some eights from the judges

2:54:50.989,2:54:56.620
it's a couple of faults was early in his

2:54:53.249,2:55:00.780
program so you won't break 400

2:54:56.620,2:55:03.250
back up about 20 points shy just over

2:55:00.780,2:55:06.240
yes of course

2:55:03.250,2:55:06.240
72

2:55:07.641,2:55:14.551
okay James Eddie what can you do for us

2:55:10.650,2:55:18.690
on your biggest dive only three men are

2:55:14.551,2:55:22.980
doing this James Denny is doing it Tom

2:55:18.690,2:55:25.830
Daly did it now I need some 95 couldn't

2:55:22.980,2:55:29.790
get eight and a half nearly nine to go

2:55:25.830,2:55:33.181
top is he capable of that

2:55:29.790,2:55:35.480
twenty-year-old completes we put it past

2:55:33.181,2:55:35.480
it

2:55:38.660,2:55:44.870
nice okay it's pretty good you did an

2:55:42.860,2:55:46.760
absolute beauty next to Tom yesterday

2:55:44.870,2:55:48.680
this is the dive they've got the way out

2:55:46.760,2:55:51.530
of right out of trouble really they were

2:55:48.680,2:55:54.290
way off the pace in the synchro both he

2:55:51.530,2:55:56.240
and Tom just not quite straightening out

2:55:54.290,2:55:57.439
into the water there you can see you

2:55:56.240,2:55:59.870
probably get six nails from the judges

2:55:57.439,2:56:01.850
just straighten out a little bit more

2:55:59.870,2:56:03.320
bit less splash he'd have been eight and

2:56:01.850,2:56:07.340
that would have been a huge score so

2:56:03.320,2:56:09.290
just under 400 total reviewing it going

2:56:07.340,2:56:10.370
over it with his coach I don't see

2:56:09.290,2:56:12.380
nothing much could be done about it this

2:56:10.370,2:56:15.770
time but when they get back on that send

2:56:12.380,2:56:17.990
me the platform again and ad will know

2:56:15.770,2:56:22.700
how to resolve that problem the problem

2:56:17.990,2:56:24.710
is say Liang Malaysia to look at the

2:56:22.700,2:56:26.390
rankings he's there in third place

2:56:24.710,2:56:29.570
doesn't seem to have shifted from that

2:56:26.390,2:56:32.930
third place the last few rounds so

2:56:29.570,2:56:36.439
what's it gonna take to get him in first

2:56:32.930,2:56:41.180
place well in this three point two

2:56:36.439,2:56:44.030
inward three and a half sixty-eight just

2:56:41.180,2:56:46.040
over a seven average we'll get him at

2:56:44.030,2:56:50.660
the top of the board with four more to

2:56:46.040,2:56:52.100
go so beautiful booty Liang is that

2:56:50.660,2:56:54.380
going to be good enough for the quads he

2:56:52.100,2:56:57.260
won the gold in the three meter

2:56:54.380,2:56:58.430
individual B teach at law most himmat

2:56:57.260,2:57:01.130
many people's surprise

2:56:58.430,2:57:04.250
he's been diving out of his skin he has

2:57:01.130,2:57:08.689
saved his best to last to do very well

2:57:04.250,2:57:11.060
in the prelims on this Wow this will be

2:57:08.689,2:57:12.830
close the pressures on will that be good

2:57:11.060,2:57:16.040
enough for silver though mitchum still

2:57:12.830,2:57:20.270
to dive all victims got a big dive green

2:57:16.040,2:57:22.310
dough has a big dive Daly will have very

2:57:20.270,2:57:24.350
little to do just complete the dive

2:57:22.310,2:57:26.330
that's pretty much his gold medal you

2:57:24.350,2:57:32.149
won't be thinking about those

2:57:26.330,2:57:33.280
now 75 will corriendo in the lead so

2:57:32.149,2:57:36.950
eights here

2:57:33.280,2:57:42.680
the Canadian I think is good as as a

2:57:36.950,2:57:43.939
medal he'll be aware of that you're

2:57:42.680,2:57:48.830
taking just a little bit more time over

2:57:43.939,2:57:51.410
this one very smooth very precise grade

2:57:48.830,2:57:53.870
entry that's all he can do is three

2:57:51.410,2:57:55.819
point two needs to make it count

2:57:53.870,2:57:57.410
so to beat you - si Lang you need to

2:57:55.819,2:58:02.149
eights will that be good enough it's

2:57:57.410,2:58:04.760
gonna be pretty tight I don't know a

2:58:02.149,2:58:08.660
little bit short the vertical as he goes

2:58:04.760,2:58:12.590
into the water great list of dives from

2:58:08.660,2:58:14.689
the canadian only 17 years old yeah yeah

2:58:12.590,2:58:17.569
you will be back I think we are seeing

2:58:14.689,2:58:20.930
something is gonna grow in every respect

2:58:17.569,2:58:24.700
in terms of his quality I think we'll

2:58:20.930,2:58:28.440
see a more bulk top render next time in

2:58:24.700,2:58:32.700
corn wealth games competition

2:58:28.440,2:58:35.460
Maksym Bashar's basically these tens if

2:58:32.700,2:58:37.200
it's gonna get into third place and

2:58:35.460,2:58:40.891
obviously daily still to come mitchum

2:58:37.200,2:58:45.990
still to come so middle will pass Maxime

2:58:40.891,2:58:47.551
Bouchard by today so top want to finish

2:58:45.990,2:58:50.580
on to even though the terrace not very

2:58:47.551,2:58:53.641
high three point two back two and a half

2:58:50.580,2:58:55.921
and one and a half twists I've seen it a

2:58:53.641,2:58:56.551
few times before yeah a little bit off

2:58:55.921,2:58:59.851
the pace

2:58:56.551,2:59:02.431
yeah Holdings elbow then just shows you

2:58:59.851,2:59:04.681
how much these divers have to ensure

2:59:02.431,2:59:09.450
hitting the water in 35 miles an hour

2:59:04.681,2:59:13.740
plus every time just so Piper so hard on

2:59:09.450,2:59:18.690
the body how does the brains well my toe

2:59:13.740,2:59:21.330
against mister at night isn't it seven

2:59:18.690,2:59:25.320
and seven point five for Maxime at

2:59:21.330,2:59:28.021
Bouchard all right now we are down to

2:59:25.320,2:59:31.801
the last two and that this was worth

2:59:28.021,2:59:35.280
eighty six point four Smalley for

2:59:31.801,2:59:39.271
Matthew Mitchum it does that now he will

2:59:35.280,2:59:43.341
get to the silver medal he does anything

2:59:39.271,2:59:46.021
under eighty two it's the bronze medal

2:59:43.341,2:59:49.290
so a fluctuation of five points would

2:59:46.021,2:59:50.790
make a lot of difference here same died

2:59:49.290,2:59:52.591
but this time in the pike position which

2:59:50.790,2:59:57.421
means it's a three point six rather than

2:59:52.591,2:59:59.070
three point two yeah it's the back two

2:59:57.421,3:00:00.450
and a half somersaults two and a half

2:59:59.070,3:00:02.851
twist that's where the extra point for

3:00:00.450,3:00:04.500
comes fun I don't think that's good

3:00:02.851,3:00:06.210
enough for the silver I think that

3:00:04.500,3:00:07.860
lonely be good enough just for the

3:00:06.210,3:00:11.190
pradhans but let's see his three point

3:00:07.860,3:00:12.601
six he's left himself a build it too

3:00:11.190,3:00:14.040
much to do maybe that won't even get a

3:00:12.601,3:00:15.721
medal let's have a look at this

3:00:14.040,3:00:17.431
two and a half twist turn half summer so

3:00:15.721,3:00:19.591
she's thrown up too much splash if he

3:00:17.431,3:00:21.450
doesn't get more than sevens he's not in

3:00:19.591,3:00:27.301
the medals water turn up for the books

3:00:21.450,3:00:29.240

3:00:27.301,3:00:31.470
the silver medalists from four years ago

3:00:29.240,3:00:35.790
it's had

3:00:31.470,3:00:38.399
a difficult four years since India just

3:00:35.790,3:00:40.380
well-documented his book he's back a

3:00:38.399,3:00:42.450
report this morning he might be back to

3:00:40.380,3:00:46.020
his best he isn't he's not gonna get a

3:00:42.450,3:00:50.479
medal this is a demonstration dive now

3:00:46.020,3:00:52.979
for Tom Daly because he needs 10 points

3:00:50.479,3:00:54.380
he won't be seen like that they wanna go

3:00:52.979,3:00:58.410
out with a flourish she wants to get

3:00:54.380,3:01:01.770
over 500 marks that's his territory

3:00:58.410,3:01:04.859
that's his domain and this is the final

3:01:01.770,3:01:09.720
dive for Tom Daly for gold at the

3:01:04.859,3:01:12.810

3:01:18.800,3:01:25.350
winning by an absolute country mile

3:01:21.840,3:01:28.649
he'll go way over 500 points 90 plus for

3:01:25.350,3:01:30.510
this one even with the challenges added

3:01:28.649,3:01:32.250
the pre lien the questions about what

3:01:30.510,3:01:36.960
he's been doing he silenced his critics
